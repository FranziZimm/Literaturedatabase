Several graduate students have written their doctoral dissertations on

gestures. In particular Elena T. Levy, Laura L. Pedelty, Debra Stephens,

Kaaren Beld:en, and Justine Cassell have devoted significant parts of

their graduate student careers to sharing my fascination with gestures.

Their work has greatly advanced our understanding and I cite them re­

peatedly in the book itself.

Other students still in the midst of their graduate study or having

written dissertations on other topics also have made great contributions

to our research on gestures. Brecky Church, Kevin Tuite, Karl-Erik

McCullough, Sotaro Kita, and Nancy L. Dray have made important

contributions which I cite in the book.

The analytic study of gesture is tremendously time consuming. Just

transcribing a gesture and getting the timing right can take 40 to 50
times longer than the gesture itself. Many people have cultivated the pe­

culiarly fatiguing art of gesture observation and transcription. I am ex­

tremely grateful to everyone for their sharp eyes and open minds, not to

mention their endurance; they first saw many of the phenomena that I

describe in this book: Desha Baker, Kaaren Bekken, Joan Boman, Dan

tion, and the Public Health Service (a National Institute of Mental

lands Institutefor Advanced Study (NIAS), inWassenaar, I had excellent discussions with Joan Bybee, then also a visitor to NIAS. Others who have been very helpful are Robin Campbell, University of Stirling; Jacques Cosnier, University ofLyon; Ino d'Arcais, University ofLeiden and the Max Planck Institutefor Psycholinguistics; and David Kelter, an­ other visitor to NIAS. Here at Chicago I have enjoyed close working re­ lations with Starkey Duncan and Susan Goldin-Meadow. Susan and I give an annual seminar entitled Communicative Uses ofNonverbal Be­ havior, which serves as a kind of forum for everyone with an interest in gestures.
Adam Kendon has read and commented on the entire manuscript of this book, as well as on many others things I have written, and his own contributions to the study of gesture are, I hope, evident from the many references I have made to his work.
Bob Morris, Dick Mowrey, Bill Pagliuca, Naomi Quinn, Michael Silverstein, JosefStern, Colwyn Trevarthen, Jenny Singleton, and Dahlia Zaidel have been valuable colleagues. George Lakoff deserves special mention, since itwashe who, in aconversationadecadeago, pointedout the type ofgesture that I describe here as metaphoric..This is one ofthe most important types ofgesture since it shows how abstract thought can be carried out in terms of representations of concrete objects and time and space.
The drawings of gestures add greatly to the clarity and attractiveness of the book. Most are the work of Laura Pedelty, my colleague and former student. Others are by Robert Williams, of the University of Chicago Press. I am extremely grateful to both Laura and Robert for their artistic drawings, and to Laura, not only for her skill and insights, but for her ability tofindtimein the midstofdemandingmedicalworkto prepare so many expressive and accurate illustrations. The index of this book was prepared by Karl-Erik McCullough.
I began writing this book during a year off from the University of Chicago which I spent at NIAS. I wish to thank NIAS for its hospitality and support during that year (1983/84). I was not able to come near fin­ ishing the book at NIAS, however, and the book was in fact not finished until 1990. By then I hadtwo more institutions to thank. First is the De­ partment ofAnthropology at Duke University. They offered me a forum to present my ideas at an early stage of development. I am particularly grateful to Naomi Quinn for all that she did to make that visit productive and pleasant. Second is the Twelfth International Summer Institute for Semiotic and Structural Studies (ISISSS90), held at the University of Toronto in the sumem r of 1990.

I wish to express my gratitude to those who sat in on the course; their comments and questions, not to mention their facial expressions, have had a great influence: Pam Sharratt, Colwyn Trevarthen, Richard Schechner, Silja Ikiheimonen-Lindgren, William C. McCormack, Tova Meltzer, and Donna Boregham. To each ofthem I give my thanks.
Most ofall, I wish to thank my family for all their support and guid­ ance. My children, Cheryl and Randall, have virtually grown up with gestures as a topic offamily conversation. Their reactions to things I have described have influenced my choices ofexamples and the ways in which I have presented them. My greatest thanks go to my wife, Nobuko, for her support and encouragement over these years, and also for her inspira­ tion. If the book has any good qualities it owes them to her. It is to her that I dedicate this book.

Introduction
This is a book about gestures and language. The gestures I mean are the
movements of the hands and arms that we see when people talk. Some­ times the movements are extensive, other times minimal, but movements there usually are. An example is a person narrating the story of a cartoon and raising her hand while she says, "and he climbed up the rope."_II1e

"the character; the movement is not the hand moving up, but this charac­ ter climbing up; the space is not the speaker's space, but a fictional space, a narrative space that exists only in the imaginary world of the discourse; and so forth. This book is about such symbols of action, movement, and space, and how they are related to spoken language.

of language. Language is a broader concept than we ordinarily suppose. This broadening of language is one of the major reasons for an interest in gestures. The effect is like viewing the world through two eyes rather than one.l11st<is bin2cular vision brings out a new dim<':l1sion of seeing,

linking gestures with language. The contribution of the present book is

to add other linguistic levels, specifically gestures linked with semantic

and pragmatic content. My argument, in a nutshell, is thatgestures are an

integral part of language as much as are words) phrases) and sentences-

gesture and language are one system. e e_

Thus one theme of this book is thadanguage is more than:wordsll�L

a tfl-fl Psycllglggyofl<inguage reqllireslls to broaci�n our concept of lan�

guage to include what seql1S, in tbe. traditional linguistic view,. the op­

A second theme (and seeing this took much time) is that gestures are

part of the discourse in which the speaker is participating. Gestures look

upward, into the discourse structure, as well as downward, into the

thought structure. A gesture will occur only if one's current thought con­
trasts with the background discourse. If there is a contrast, how the

thought is related to the discourse determines what kind of gesture it will

be, how.large it will be, how internally complex it will be, and so forth.

Often, therefore, we can see the overarching discourse structure more

\ s:learly in the gesture than in the words and sentences.

£;, A third theme is that the gesture itself has an impact on thought. The

gesture supplies the idiosyncratic, the personal, and the context-specific

'Ilspects of thought, to be combined with the socially regulated aspects

that come from the conventions of language. Such a combination implies

a dialectic of gesture and language in which the gesture provides the mo­

mentary context of speaking and language carries this individuality to

the social plane where it is categorized, segmented, reformatted, and

.Jdressed up for the world. Putting these themes together, we can conceive of thought as funda­

mentally an inner discourse in which gestures play an intrinsic part. Each

new gesture is the breaking edge of an inner discourse that we but par­

tially express to the world. If our mode of thought is narrative, asJerome

Bruner has so eloquently argued in a recent series of books (Bruner 1986, 1990), that is, if our thought is a story that we are required to keep telling
in order to think about our world at all, it is gestures that actively influ­

ence this story and carry it forward most expressively.

Gestures have attracted the attention of writers for at least two millen­

nia.1 However, the original interest was mainly in rhetoric. Quintilian,

in the first century A.D., specified in detail the gestures that orators should use during their speeches. This use of gesture, as part of rhetoric, has been the theme of many later works as well, most notably, for the
English speaking world, the books ofJohn Bulwer ([1644] 1974) whose
Chirologia and Chironomia were the first on gesture published in English. Both Quintilian and Bulwer took care to specify gestures that could be designed in advance as deliberate elements in a ��oreographed presenta- , tion. They are thus quite distinct from the spontaneous gestures that are
the subject matter of this book. A new basis for interest in gesture devel­
oped during the Enlightenment and this interest, to some extent, con­ tinues to the present. In the eighteenth century philosophers became deeply concerned with the origin of language and the universal basis of
reason. A number of thinkers supposed that the first languages were ges­ tural. Condillac ([1756] 1971), in particular, argued that the original
language emerged from "natural" signs, viz., gestures (cf. Harris and
Taylor 1989). The connection of gesture to thought was the focus of in­ terestfor Wilhelm Wundt ( [1921] 1973), the founder of the first modern
psychological laboratory, although he confined this interest to conven­ tionalized gestures (Neapolitan, American Indian, deaf signs), the pro­ found differences of which from spontaneous gestures are the subject of
chapter 2 of this book. Nonetheless, Wundt made gesture into a major
explanatory link for how "inner form" becomes translated into "outer form"-a concept that also figures in contemporary psycholinguistics. None of these early investigators, however, considered the spontaneous�
gestures accompanying speech that are the chief focus of this book. Those gestures were not described until the pioneering research of
David Efron (1941), a student of Franz Boas. Several methodological
issues had to be faced before ephemeral gestures could become the sub­ ject of study. Efron's dissertation was a comparison of the gestures of im­
migrant and "assimilated" Europeans in New York City. Along with his discussion of this question Efron, with great originality, introduced the categories of gesture that have been the foundation of all subsequent schemes of gesture classification and pioneered the method of observing
gestures "from life" (see chap. 3). Efron thus opened up to scrutiny the
topic of spontaneous gestures and provided the categories for describing them. Despite the pathbreaking character of this work, Efron's findings were limited by technical factors, especially the fact that his recording was done by eye, without benefit of sound film. There was no possibility of
replaying gestures to extract the fine movement details that are crucial for getting their meaning and for synchronizing them with speech. (Efron made some slow-motion films, but apparently these were silent.) His

Introduction

book contains numerous drawings but the exact linkage of the gesture to speech cannot be examined at all.
Scientific interest in human communication took a new turn after World War II, inspired in part by information theory and cybernetics. As Kendon writes, "Once human action was conceived of as if it were a code in an information transmission system, the question of the nature of the
coding system came under scrutiny" (Kendon 1982, 53). The analysis of communication fashionable in this period distinguished sharply between digital and analogical codes: a digital code was best exemplified by the linguistic system itself, while analogical codes appeared in the so-called paralinguistic signals-the very terminology asserting a dichotomy. Prosody (voice pitch and loudness), posture, facial expression, and ges­
ture were regarded as analogical signals and thus paralinguistic-beside language. However, language is digital and analogical, it is verbal and gestural. Far from being "beside" language, gesture is actively part of lan­ guage. We have to stand the now traditional concept of a gesture on its head. My purpose in this book is to bring to light this new understanding and to suggest some of the far-reaching implications for psychology and
linguistics. My personal interest in gestures goes back to 1962. I can date it so
precisely because that was the year I moved from Berkeley to the Center for Cognitive Studies at Harvard. Among the many remarkable things I found at the center were two individuals whose gestures differed so markedly that I could not help noticing them. They were colleagues and often talked to each other, each gesticulating in his own way. These peo­ ple looked to me like sculptors working in different media. One was al­ ways pounding and pushing some heavy blocklike stuff. I imagined that
his medium was clay or marble. The other was drawing out and weaving some incredibly delicate spidery stuff. His medium looked like strings or spider webs. That was my inauguration to gestures. At that early stage, I had no idea that gestures and speech should be viewed as two sides of a
single system. However, by the time I took up gestures in earnest I was indeed propelled by the idea that gestures and speech must be considered
jointly as components of a single process. A first hint of this single process came in 1974; I suddenly became
aware of my son's gestures. He was then four years old, and I was sure
that I had earlier seen from him very few gestures of any kind. Something had taken place in his language development that suddenly triggered ges­ tures (the emergence of abundant gestures at about this age has since been documented with larger samples of children; see chapter 1 1). At about this same time, I also videorecorded a technical discussion between

Introduction

two mathematicians expressly for the purpose of studying their gestures. Speech and gesture in this discussion were clearly linked (these gestures are described in chapter 6). So began my appreciation of the speech­ gesture nexus. My first written discussions of gesture appeared as chap­ ters in several books (Solso 1975; McNeill 1979; Rauch and Carr 1980).
I proposed writing this book in 1983, because by then I believed that I understood the phenomenon of gesture sufficiently well to expound on it at length. No doubt this self-deception served a useful purpose. I doubt noW that I would have set out on a project of such vastness if! had known that it would take nearly ten years to finish. The book took this long for two reasons, both I hope respectable. First, my students and I kept find­ ing out new things about gestures and these altered the picture, in some cases profoundly. Also, concurrently with the new discoveries and largely driven by them, my own understanding of what gestures imply for inter­ preting the functioning of the mind grew ever deeper. Nonetheless, I continued writing; inevitably the book passed through many revisions
and with the advent of word processing the revisions have become truly innumerable. I admire and stand in awe of people who write their books
in a year or two. In my case, it has taken much longer. Eventually even the name of the book changed. I mention this fact since other publications,
by myself and others, have already cited the book under its old name: "Mirrors of Gesture." Although I once rather liked this title, and have even been told that it has a certain air of mystery, I gave it up when I became convinced that the metaphor of a mirror suggests a relationship of gestures to language that is altogether too static. It is at odds with the emphasis on dynamic processes that runs throughout the book. It also is at odds with the active constitutive role that I see gestures playing in our thoughts. A mirror does nothing, it is entirely passive; and passive reflec­
tion is far from the case with gestures. I also have had a problem with nomenclature. What am I to call my
subject? The word "gesture" comes from the Latin for action, for carry­ ing out an activity, and for performing. It thus comes from a word whose reference is to serious things, and the word "gestate" has the same source.
Even the OED does not recognize the sense of "gesture" that now seems to have become dominant. It is undeniable that the word has fallen on hard times: to many people "gesture" implies something "trivial," "inef­ fectual" or "empty of importance or substance." People talk about some­ thing being a "gesture," rather than being the "real thing." Commenting on a new building, one Chicago critic wrote that "they make a gesture that falls aesthetically short ofthe mark" (Chicago Tribune SundayMaga­ zine, 25 December 1988). Apparently "gesture" and "falling short of

6

Introduction

the mark" naturally go together. I gave considerable thought to this problem, even contemplating neologisms such as "temaniotics" (a word formed from Japanese, "temane," which means the hands picturing the world), and the word "gesticulation" that Adam Kendon prefers (Kendon 1 980). But temaniotics is obscure and gesticulation conjures
up, for some people, an image of windmilling arms.I have thus kept the simple word "gesture." There is also a book on Indian dance and the art of the actor, TheMirror ofGesture (Nandikesvara 1917), whose dedica­
tion reveals an altogether more welcoming attitude: "The movement of whose body is the world, whose speech the sum of all language, whose
jewels are the moon and stars-to that pure Siva I bow!" (p.13). And so, in this book as well, we shall bow to what, following Nandikesvara,I will
simply call "gestures."

Topics, which consists of applications of the theory in two important special cases: children (chapter 1 1 ) and the brain (chapter 12). The brain chapter includes descriptions of the gestures of aphasic patients and split­ brain patients, and reproduces an entire narrative (including gestures) by a split-brain person.Finally, there is an appendix in which I describe in detail the methods of gesture collection, recording, description, and cod­ ing that I followed. This kind of description will be of value to re­ searchers but would get in the way of readers who have an interest in the
semiotic systems of gesture and language but no interest in carrying out a research project of this kind.

Like authors everywhere I hope that my book will be read and appre­

ciated. However, I do not deceive myself: there is more here about ges­

tures than many will want to know. Hence I propose a method for

reading this book selectively.The text is divided into four smaller parts.I

have not written these parts to be independent, and chapters from one

often refer to chapters in another, but this division suggests a way to read

selectively. Part 1 is Setting the Stage and consists of chapter 1 , which

gives an overview of the main gesture types and defends from rivals the

i:

hypothesis that gestures and language constitute a single system, and chapter 2, which compares the kinds of spontaneous gestures that ac­

company speech to systematic manual sign languages. Since so much has

been written in recent decades on sign language, it seems appropriate and

convenient to begin the exposition of spontaneous gestures by discuss­

ing the similarities and differences of gestures and signs.The next part is

Varieties of Gesture, a kind of encyclopedia rich in examples that covers

the different types of gesture in their great variety and gives the basic sta­

tistical data on gesture occurrence: chapter 3 is on the classification and

distribution of gestures, including a complete narrative by an adult

speaker; chapter 4 is on the gestures of the concrete (the iconics); chapter

5 describes an experimental proof that gestures are meaningful symbols;

and chapter 6 is on the gestures of the abstract (the metaphorics, beats,

spatials, and abstract deictics). The third part is Theory: chapter 7 pre­

sents the relationship of gestures to discourse; chapter 8 develops the

concept of the "growth point" of utterances and presents a model of self­

organization of utterances and gestures; Chapter 9 develops the concept

that gestures have an impact on thought; chapter 10 describes several ex­

periments that probe the self-organizational cycle. The final part is

Iflanguage was given to men to conceal their thoughts, then gesture's purpose was to disclose them.
-John Napier, Hands
This inscription provides an appropriate place to start the book that fol­ lows. Napier's book (1980) was about the evolution, mechanics, and functioning of the human hand. He ended his account with the above comment on the hands as symbolic instruments. This book starts at the same place and asks: how are human thoughts disclosed in gestures?
When people talk they can be seen making spontaneous movements called gestures.These are usually movements of the arms and hands and are closely synchronized with the flow of speech. The implication of ges­ tures that interests me is the possibility of embracing in one theoretical system two forms of expression; speech and action. Gestures and speech occur in very close temporal synchrony and often have identical mean­ ings. Yet they express these meanings in completely different ways. Com­ paring speech to gesture produces an effect on our understanding of language and thoughtsomething like the effect of triangulation in vision. Many details, previously hidden, spring out in a new dimension. Rather than causing us to slice a person analytically into semi-isolated modules, taking gesture into account encourages us to see something like the en­ tire person as a theoretical entity-his thinking, speaking, willing, feel­ ing, and acting, as a unit.
My aim is to provide a conceptual framework that includes both ges­ ture and language. This broader framework will show how gestures and speech are linked, and how they are different. At a minimum, the frame­ work should explain how speech, which is linear through time, is related to the type of thinking that we see exhibited in the simultaneous gesture, thinking that is instantaneous, imagistic and global-analog rather than digital.
Gestures exhibit images that cannot always be expressed in speech, as well as images the speaker thinks are concealed. Speech and gesture must cooperate to express the person's meaning. A conception of language and gesture as a single integrated system is sharply different from the no­ tion of a "body language"-a communication process utilizing signals made up of body movements, which is regarded by its believers as sepa­ rate from and beyond normal language. This concept is the product of an excessively narrow analysis,just as is the traditional linguistic notion of a
11

12

Setting the Stage

spoken language as exclusively comprising a system of speech sounds
plus a gramam r. The topic of this book is, specifically, gestures that exhibit images. With
these kinds of gesture people unwittingly display their inner thoughts and
ways of understanding events of the world. These gestures are the per­ son's memories and thoughts rendered visible. Gestures are like thoughts themselves. They belong, not to the outside world, but to the inside one of memory, thought, and mental images. Gesture images are complex, intricately interconnected, and not at all like photographs. Gestures open up a wholly new way of regarding thought processes, language, and the
interactions of people. I want now to give a sketch of the major types of gesture. I will illus­
trate these types and give many more details in later chapters.

Types of Gesture
0lJIconics
Some gestures are "iconic" and bear a close formal relationship to the semantic content of speech. For example, when describing a scene from a comic book story in which a character bends a tree back to the ground, a speaker appeared to grip something and pull it back (see fig. 1.1):

Figure 1 . 1 . Illustration of an iconic gesture with "and he [bends it way back] ." The gesture exhibits the same act referred to in speech.
(1.1) and he [bends it way back] 1
Iconic: hand appears togrip something andpull itfrom the upperfront space back and down near to the shoulder.
1 . In citing gesture examples I will use the following conventions: speech w' ill be un­ derscored; the extent of the meaningful part of the gesture-the stroke phase-will be shown by enclosing the concurrent segments of speech in square brackets [ ] ; when the gesture is held motionlessly there will be dots ( . . .); the gesture itselfwill be described in italics. Ifmore than one stroke takes place, they will be numbered. Silent hesitations will be shown with slanted lines (I), and filled hesitations with a rendition ofthe sound. On occa­ sion, I will also show the gesture preparation and retraction phases. In these cases, to avoid a clutter of brackets, I will show the onset of the preparation with a left bracket (D, the stroke in boldface, and the end ofthe retraction with a right bracket (]).

The speaker (not a habitual comic book reader) had been given a comic book as part of an experiment on narrative (see Marslen-Wilson, Levy, and Tyler, 1982). The gesture reveals not only the speaker 's memory im­
age but also the particular point of view that he had taken toward it. The
speaker had the choice of playing the part of the agent or the tree. He was "seeing" the event from the viewpoint of the agent performing the act­
otherwise his hand would not have taken the form of a grip-rather than
the viewpoint of the tree undergoing the act. In the latter case, we would expect a gesture in which the arm moves back but without the grip.
The example illustrates the close connection that exists between speech and gesture. It shows how what is depicted through gesture should be incorporated into a complete picture of a person's thought
processes. The gesture movement-the "stroke"-coincided with the part of the utterance that presented the same meaning. Semantically, the
sentence described bending something back while the gesture concur­ rently exhibited the same bending back image. Moreover, the image was from the point of view of the actor, and when we look at the active form
of sentence, "he bends it way back," we see that it also implies the point of view of the actor. The passive, "it got bent way back," for example, would be more appropriate for the viewpoint of the tree. Thus, both seman­
tically and pragmatically, in terms of focus, the gesture and utterance were parallel expressions of meaning.
Along with this kind of coexpressiveness, there is also complemen­ tarity. Speech and gesture refer to the same event and are partially over­ lapping, but the pictures they present are different. Jointly, speech and
gesture give a more complete insight into the speaker 's thinking. In the following example speech conveys the ideas of pursuit and recurrence while gesture conveys the weapon used (an umbrella); both speech and gesture refer to the same event, but each presents a somewhat different
aspect of it (see fig. 1.2):

Figure 1 .2. Illustration ofspeech­ gesture complementation with "she [chases him out again]." The ges­ ture reveals the weapon while speech conveys the action (chasing) and the idea ofrecurrence.

(1.2) and she [chases him out again] Iconic: hand appears to swing an object through the air.

If we were to look only at the gesture or the speech, we would have an

incomplete picture of the speaker's memory and mental representation

of the scene. It is only through a joint consideration of both gesture and

speech that we see all the elements: the type of action, its recurrence, the

(!jweapon, and how it was used.

physical object (the Vehicle). Such metaphors can be documented in speech forms as well. In speech we say, for instance, "hollow words" or "a deep booJs"-implying that a word is a container, or a book has a vertical
dimension (Reddy 1979; Lakoff andJohnson 1980). We also speak of the "presentation" of an idea or argument-implying that communica­
tion is over a path or conduit. The metaphor in which language, mean­ ing, knowledge, genre, works of art, etc., are presented as a physical container into which substance is put and the whole is moved along a conduit has been called the conduit metaphor; we will see many examples
of gestural conduit metaphors in this book. The conduit image of ab­
stract ideas as physical containers is, for speakers brought up in the tradition of Western culture, a major source of metaphoric images. How­ ever, this image does not appear with speakers brought up in other, non­
Western traditions (Chinese, for example).

Beats
A third type of gesture we term the "beat." Beats are so named because
they look like beating musical time. Others have termed this gesture the "baton" (Efron 1941; Ekman and Friesen 1969)-naming it after the in­ strument rather than the function. The hand moves along with the rhyth­ mical pulsation of speech (although the synchrony is not absolutely perfect; see McClave, 1991). Unlike iconics and metaphorics, beats tend to have the same form regardless of the content (McNeill and Levy 1982). The typical beat is a simple flick of the hand or fingers up and down, or back and forth; the movement is short and quick and the space may be the periphery of the gesture space (the lap, an armrest of the chair, etc.). The critical thing that distinguishes the beat from other types of gesture is that it has just two movement phases-in/out, up/down, etc. !conics and metaphorics typically have three phases-preparation, stroke, and retraction. Of all gestures, beats are the most insignificant looking. But appearances are deceptive. Beats reveal the speaker's con­ ception of the narrative discourse as a whole. The semiotic value of a beat lies in the fact that it indexes the word or phrase it accompanies as being significant, not for its own semantic content, but for its discourse­ pragmatic content. Examples are marking the introduction of new characters, summarizing the action, introducing new themes, etc. Thus beats mark information that does not advance the plot line but provides the structure within which the plot line unfolds. With beats, events on the meta-level of the discourse can be inserted directly into the narrative, signaling that whatever refers in speech to the event departs from the nar­ rated chain of events. Such departures can be brief and can be over in the

16

Setting the Stage

confines of a single word. An example is the following, a beat that accom­ panied a reference to the theme of an episode. The spoken utterance does not refer to a particular incident but characterizes a class of incidents,and the beat marked the word (''whenever'') that signaled this reference to the discourse as a whole rather than a specific event (see fig. 1.4):

Figure 1.4. Illustrating a beat with a summing up statement, "when[ever sheJ ." The beat coin­ cides with the specific linguistic segment that does the summing up.

(Halliday and Hasan 1976). While beats highlight discontinuities in the

fact, are great demonstrators of cohesive beats. Political speeches are ac­

companied by an incessant beat presence. The meaning of all those beats

is, I think, cohesion on the meta-level.What the politician is in effect say­

ing is: Here is a series of points that I am making, and the crucial thing

about them is that each belongs to a consistent platform (hence the cohe­

sion of beats). Certainly every politician holds that his views on the issues

are individually significant while adding up to a consistent platform. The

beat is accordingly the politician's gesture par excellence.

Gestural cohesion depends on repeating the same gesture form,

movement, or locus in the gesture space: the repetition is what signals

the continuity. The repeated gesture shows, in the most direct way, the

recurrence or continuation of a theme. An example with an iconic ges-

episodes first made interrupted herself

came about because the speaker realized that she had better first explain

how trolleys work (no longer so obvious in some places) and broke off

be arranged after the explanation had been given, and this was accom­

plished by the second crisscross iconic (see fig. 1.5):

The same gesture thus occurred twice with the effect of informing the
hearer where to go to get back to the story line after the interruption. The second crisscross was cohesive in that it tied together two parts of the

Setting the Stage

narrative by showing, literally, where the old theme was located. Again there is speech and gesture coexpressiveness. The sentence with the sec­ ond crisscross gesture also included a cohesive item, the pronoun "these." It presupposed an earlier reference to the wires in question and likewise had the effect of sending the hearer back to the interrupted theme (Halliday and Hasan 1976). Notice that the cohesive connection appeared first in the gestural channel.

Deictics
A final type of gesture important for narrative is the familiar pointing, or "deictic" gesture.Pointing has the obvious function of indicating objects and events in the concrete world, but it also plays a part even where there is nothing objectively present to point at (McNeill, Cassell, and Levy, to appear). Most pointing gestures in narratives and conversations are of this abstract kind. The following example is from a conversation between two previously unacquainted students (see fig. 1 .6):

Figure 1.6. Illustration ofan ab­ stract pointing gesture with "[where did you1 come from be­ fore?" The space being pointed at is not the space where the speaker and hearer currently find themselves, but an abstract space housing an in­ troduced reference.
0( 1 . 8 ) [where did you] come from before? 0ints to space between selfand interlocutor.
The gesture is aimed not at an existing physical place where the interlocu­ tor had been previously, but at an abstract concept of where he had been before. As we know from the earlier context of the conversation, the physical locus of this place was in a different city. Although the space may seem empty, it was full to the speaker. It was a palpable space in which a concept could be located as if it were a substance. Abstract pointing ges­ tures imply a metaphorical picture of their own in which abstract ideas have a physical locus.

Language has the effect ofsegmenting and lineariZIng meaning. what might be an instantaneous thought is divided up and strung out through time. A single event, say, somebody sitting down on a chair, is analyzed into segments: the person, the chair, the movement, the direction, and so forth. These segments are organized into a hierarchically structured string of words (for example, the sentence above). The total effect is to present what had been a single instantaneous picture in the form of a string of segments. Segmentation and linearization to form a hierarchy are essential characteristics of all linguistic systems, including languages that are not spoken at all, such as American Sign Language (ASL)-the manual language of the deaf in North America (see chap. 2). Saussure ([1916] 1959) explained that the linear-segmented character of language is a property that arises because language is unidimensional while mean­ ings are multidimensional. Language can only vary along the single di­ mension of time-phonemes, words, phrases, sentences, discourse: at all levels, language depends on variations along this one axis of time. This restriction forces language to break meaning complexes into segments and to reconstruct multidimensional meanings by combining the seg­ ments in time. mu,GltieCsltimureenssair()el1dailfafenrdenptrienseenvetrmy ewaanyin.

Gestures areglobaLandsynthr:tir: aJ)d never hierarchical..The following sections describe thelle PrQpertieliof gestures thatIEake them different from language.
Global-Synthetic
These terms refer to the relationship of parts to wholes in gestures. In language, parts (the words) are combined to create a whole (a sentence); the direction thus is from part to whole. In gestures, in contrast, the di­ rection is from whole to part. The whole determines the meanings of the parts (thus it is "global"). In language, moreover, the relationship of words to meaning is analytic. Distinct meanings are attached to distinct words. In gestures, however, one gesture can combine many meanings (it is "synthetic"). An example that illustrates both the global and syn­ thetic properties is the following typical iconic gesture (see fig. 1 .7):

20

Setting the Stage

Figure 1. 7. Illustrating the global-synthetic property ofa gesture with "[and he's trying to run ahead ofitJ ." The gesture has parts (trajectory, wiggling fingers), but the meanings ofthe parts depend on the meaning ofthe whole; the parts are not independently mean­ ingful morphemes or words in a language.
( 1 .9) [and he's trying to run ahead of it] Iconic: handmovesforward at chin levelwhilefingers wiglg e.
The gesture is a symbol in that it represents something other than itself-the hand is not a hand but a character, the movement is not a hand in motion but the character in motion, the space is not the physical space of the narrator but a narrative space, the wiggling fingers are not fingers but running feet. The gesture is thus a symbol, but the symbol is of a fundamentally different type from the symbols of speech.
This gesture-symbol is global in that the whole is not composed out of separately meaningful parts. Rather, the parts gain meaning because of the meaning of the whole. The wiggling fingers mean running only be­ cause we know that the gesture, as a whole, depicts someone running. It's

Images, Inside and Out

21

not that a gesture depicting someone running was composed out of sepa­ rately meaningful parts: wiggling + motion, for instance.
The gesture also is synthetic.It combines different meaning elements. The segments of the utterance, "he + running + along the wire," were combined in the gesture into a single depiction of Sylvester-running­
along-the-wire.

Noncombinatonc
Gestures also are noncombinatoric: two gestures produced together don't combine to form a larger, more complex gesture.There is no hier­ archical structure of gestures made out of other gestures. This noncom­ binatoric property contrasts with the hierarchical structure of language. In sentences, lower constituents combine into higher constituents.With gestures, each symbol is a complete expression of meaning unto itself. Most of the time gestures are one to a clause but occasionally more than one gesture occurs within a single clause.Even then the several gestures don't combine into a more complex gesture. Each gesture depicts the content from a different angle, bringing out a different aspect or tem­ poral phase, and each is a complete expression of meaning by itself. This situation is illustrated by the next example, taken from a film narrative (see fig. 1 .8):

Figure 1.8. Illustrating two gestures in one clause with "[ . . . and she . . . J [grabsJ the knife." The gestures are two phases ofan event, but do not combine into a higher level gesture.

(2) Hand turns up and closes to afist:gripping an ((object.))
The gestures are related but do not combine into a single higher ges­ ture. The gestures, rather, present successive snapshots of the scene. The clause also describes this scene, but whereas the parts of the clause, "she," "grabs," and "the knife," combine to form the clause, groping plus grab­ bing do not combine to form a larger gesture. Far from combining, the two gestures maximized the contrast between them: the horizontal ori­ entation and circling movement of (1) changed into the vertical orienta­ tion and closed fist of (2).

Other Nonlinguistic Properties
NO STANDARDS OF FORM. Linguistic systems impose standards of well-formedness to which all utterances must conform or be dismissed as "not English" or "notJapanese" or not whatever language the speaker is using. The standards are "the way we do it." Gestures have no equivalent to this implicit standard of form. Gestures by different individuals often are similar when the content of the gesture is similar, but this similarity is because of the content and not because individuals are conforming to standards for making the gesture. The gestures of different speakers can present the same meanings but do so in quite different forms. Moreover, the gestures of people speaking different languages are no more different than the gestures of different people speaking the same language. While their speech moves in different directions to meet linguistic standards, their gestures remain close together. This nonstandardized quality of gestures is important for theoretical purposes. Precisely because gest�res are not obliged to meet standards of form, they are free to present Just those aspects of meaning that are relevant and salient to the speaker and leave out aspects that language may require but are not relevant to the situation (linguists have discussed the problem of defining relevance, but have not availed themselves of the gesture channel as a source of evi­ dence; see Sperber and Wilson 1987).

NO DUALITY O F PATTERNING. Another difference from language is that gestures lack duality of patterning. This is the property of true lin­
guistic systems in which words enter into two patterns of contrast at once (Hockett 1958). The word "dog" differs from other words in meaning:
here the contrasts are to "cat," "wolf," "monkey," etc. The word also dif­ fers from other words in sounds: now the contrasts are to "cog," "doll,"

Images, Inside and Out

23

"dig," etc. One pattern is a structure of meanings and the other of sounds. Duality of patterning is deeply connected to the arbitrariness of signs. Since meaning and sounds are structured separately, the two sys­
tems can be related by arbitrary mappings (Saussure [1916] 1959). Ges­ tures are profoundly different from words in that they lack this duality of patterning and the associated system of arbitrary mappings. There are no
separately structured systems of form and meaning in gestures. A gesture
patterns in only one way, that of meaning. Kinesic form is not an inde­ pendent level as sound is an independent level of language. Kinesic form
in a gesture is determined by its meaning. (This is true even of beats, whose role as a universal emphasizer lacking content of its own is paral­ leled by its simplicity of form.) If we explain the meaning of a gesture we explain the form. Not having duality of patterning is a strength of ges­
tures. It explains how they are able to express meanings that may be diffi­
cult to get into the verbal channel.

Yet Gestures and Language Are a Single System
Gestures and language thus differ from each other on a number of funda­ mental dimensions. Yet they are also closely linked. The following de­ scribes some of these linkages. Such linkages imply that gestures and speech should be viewed within a unified conceptual framework as as­ pects of a single underlying process (see McNeill 1985b) :
1. Gestures occur only during speech. While emblems and pantomimes may be delivered in utter silence, the gestures that are the focus of atten­ tion for us are almost invariably accompanied by speech. In about 100 hours of recorded narratives, only one gesture was made by a listener. Gesture production and adopting the role of spealcer are virtually limited to the same situations. Moreover, 90% of all gestures by speakers occur when the speaker is actually uttering something.The acts of spealcing and gesturing are bound to each other in time.
2. Gestures and speech are semantically and pragmatically coexpressive.
That is, the gestures that accompany utterances also present the same or closely related meanings semantically and perform the same functions pragmatically.!conics accompany utterances that depict concrete objects and events and fulfill a narrative function (see chap. 5). Metaphorics ac­ company utterances that refer to the pragmatic structure of the discourse as a whole. They present their own image of the discourse as an object or space or other physical reality. Other gesture types have their own paral­ lels with speech (see chap. 7).
3. Gestures and speech are synchronous. The specific linguistic segments

24

Setting the Stage

that are coexpressive with the gesture are cotemporal. The most mean­ ingful segment of the gesture is the stroke, and it lines up in time with the equivalent linguistic segment, as in the example given in (1.1) where the
subject said, "and he [bends it way back]," and the stroke showed bend­ ing back during the same interval of time. Such synchrony implies that the speaker is presenting the same meaning in both channels at once. Having a shared meaning could be the basis for integrating gesture and
speech into a single performance. 4. Gestures and speech develop together in children. Children's first ges­
tures are concrete pointing and certain kinds of iconics. Much later they add other kinds of iconics, beats, metaphorics and, last of all, abstract pointing. In general, this progression follows the same path as the devel­ opment of speech. As children's speech development moves from a
largely referential focus, through descriptive elaboration, and finally to the ability to structure discourse, so their gestures develop from a largely concrete deictic emphasis, through various kinds of iconic gestures, and finally to the discourse-referring gestures-metaphors, abstract point­ ing, and beats. Beats do not appear at all in children much younger than 5 years and are not abundant until 1 1 years; yet, considered as movements, beats are the simplest of motions-just flicks of the hand. It is the dis­
course structure that determines that these flicks have meaning, and the development of this structure is late and the beat gesture itself thus
doesn't occur. 5 . Gestures and speech breaJe down together in aphasia. Broca's aphasia
consists of a relatively intact ability to use referring terms but a radically impaired ability to combine terms into larger gramam tical units. This type of speech is often called "telegraphic." The gestures of Broca's apha­ sics are parallel in the sense that they are discrete and consist of abundant iconics; their gesture repertoire contains almost no metaphorics or beats. Wernicke's aphasics present the contrasting picture of fluent speech but a
more or less complete loss of the ability to make coherent semantic con­ nections. The gestures of Wernicke type aphasics are large, mobile, but devoid of interpretable meaning. In contrast to the Broca's aphasics they
may have few iconics but there are abundant metaphorics and beats. Thus, the neurological damage that produces contrasting aphasic syn­
dromes affects gestures in strikingly parallel ways. For all of these reasons gestures and speech are most appropriately re­
garded as two sides of a single underlying verbal-gestural process of con­ structing and presenting meanings. This argument will be developed in detail over the next several chapters. Despite the fundamental character

Images, Inside and Out

25

of the differences between gestures and speech-one global and syn­
thetic, the other linear and segmented-they are closely tied together in meaning, time, function, development, and dissolution. What we can learn about this unified process of meaning construction out of such op­ posite systems of symbols is the substance of this book.

Gestures and Time

The issue of how gestures and speech relate in time is crucial for under­ standing the system that includes gesture and speech as two parts. As shown by the phenomenon that gestures slightly anticipate speech,ges­ tures and speech have a constant relationship in time. To express this rela­
tionship I will first describe the phenomenon of gesture anticipation. After that, I will describe three rules for gesture synchrony. That gestures could both anticipate and synchronize with speech is only seemingly a
paradox, as I will explain.

Gesture Anticipation and Its Meaning

A prototypical gesture passes through three phases (Kendon 1980). There is first the preparation for the gesture: the hand rises from its rest­ ing place and moves to the front away from the speaker. Then there is the stroke, the main part of the gesture: the hand moves backward from the
preparation phase and ends up near the shoulder. Finally there is the re­ traction, the return of the hand to quiescence: the hand falls back to the rest position. The preparation and retraction phases are optional but the
stroke is essential. If there is a preparation phase, however, we can exam­ ine where it occurs.This phase regularly anticipates by a brief interval the coexpressive linguistic segment(s) (Kendon 1972, 1980). The "bends it way back" example cited earlier is such a case. Here is that example again
now with the preparation phase indicated:

(1.11) he grabs a big [oak tree and he bends it way back]

(1)

(2)

(1) Preparation phase: hand risesfrom armrest ofchair and moves up and
forward at eye level, taking ongrip shape atsame time. (2) Strokephase: hand appears topull something backwards and down, end­ ing up near the shoulder.

There is no explanation of the movement of the hand at (1) other than to get ready to perform the stroke at (2). The image of grasping and pull-

26

Setting the Stage

ing was already taking shape when the speaker was saying "oak tree" in
the previous clause. This can be taken to show that the speaker was for­ mulating the next utterance while still producing the previous one.
The anticipation of speech by gesture is important evidence for the argument that gestures reveal utterances in their primitive form: there is a global-synthetic image taking form at the moment the preparation phase begins, but there is not yet a linguistic structure with which it can ' integrate. The gesture in (1.11) began in the previous clause but could
integrate with speech only with the words "bends it way back." One could argue that the full sentence was planned in advance, during the preparation phase, and this is what started off the gesture preparation, but this argument is actually quite weak. I will consider it and several
other counterarguments at the end of the chapter. For the moment, I will only emphasize that gesture preparations reg­
ularly anticipate their coexpressive speech. I next will introduce what ap­ pears to be a paradox: the gesture in (1.11) also synchronized with speech.

Synchronization
I will give three "rules" governing how speech and gesture synchronize. Oddly, gestures both anticipate and synchronize with speech. This is not, however, the paradox that it may seem. Anticipation and synchroniza­ tion refer to different phases of the gesture. The synchrony rules refer to the stroke phase: anticipation refers to the preparation phase. It is only the stroke of the . gesture that is integrated with speech into a single smooth performance, but the preparation for the stroke slightly leads the coexpressive speech, as we have seen (also see table 4.2).

PHONOLOGICAL SYNCHRONY RULE . The synchrony rule at this level is that the stroke of the gesture precedes or ends at, but does not follow, the phonological peak syllable of speech (Kendon 1980). In other words, the stroke phase of the gesture is integrated into the phonology of the utter­ ance. For example, the stroke phase of the "bends it way back" gesture was the hand pulling back on an imaginary tree and it ended at the word "back." This word was the phonological peak of the utterance. The
speaker will temporarily cease moving his hand when phonological syn­ chrony threatens to break down, so strong is the urge to keep the gesture and speech together. In an example cited by Kendon (1980), there was a downward stroke followed by a static post-stroke hold. The effect of the hold was to maintain the "umbrella" hand shape of the gesture until the

The stroke phase had taken place prematurely during the low intensity part of the utterance, but the speaker held the gesture until the pho­ nological peak caught up.

�SEMANTIC SYNCHRONY RULE
c annels, speech and gesture,

. Semantic synchrony means present the same meanings

that the two at the same

tIme. The rule can be stated as follows: if gestures and speech co-occur

they must cover the same idea unit. The term "idea unit" is meant to

�ake provision for synchronized speech and gestures where the mean­

How is semantic synchrony preserved in the face of these phenomena?

1. Pauses. A semantically coexpressive gesture stroke will continue

through the pause, thus showing that the semantic structure of the inter­

rupted speech remains intact (Kendon 1980). Despite the interruption in

28

the flow of speech, semantic synchrony is preserved. Kendon gives this example :

ofhaving multiple gestures in one clause: here we have one gesture and multiple clauses. Semantic synchronywould be violatedifduring the sec­ ond clause the speaker proceeded to make a newgesture or ifthe second clause were not an unpacking of the stroke at (1) but some other, alto­ gether different clause. However, neither of these breakdowns of syn­ chrony occurred. Retraction has nosignificancein itself, it is semantically neutral; and the second clause was semantically a continuation of the stroke at (1). Thus examples like (1.13) do not violate semantic syn­ chrony. In fact, such examples show an important further observation: the images exhibited in gestures might require multiple clauses to be un­ packed into speech.

PRAGMATIC SYNCHRONY RULE. The rule here says that ifgestures and speech co-occur they perform the same pragmatic functions. Pragmatic synchrony implies that speakers are limited to one pragmatic reference at a time. However, this does not prevent speakers from making other, se­ mantic references in the same utterance. In the earlier example of a con­ duit gesture (fig. 1.3), the utterance mentioned thegenre ofthe cartoon: "it was a Sylvester and Tweety cartoon." This semantic reference was used to identify the genre of the upcoming narrative. The gesture de­ picted something quite different, a bounded object. The utterance thus had one reference and the gesture a different metaphoric one, but utter­ ance and gesture came together on thepragmatic level ofpresenting the narrative genre. The utterance did this by identifying the main characters ofthe story and the gesture did it by presenting the story as an object in its own right. Coexpressiveness in this case arose on the level ofpragma­ tic meaning, not on the level ofsemantic meaning. Pragmatic synchrony has no exceptions so far as I am aware, even though, again, it is the­ oretically possible to combine gestures and sentences that perform differ­ ent functions (for instance, one could combine "and drops it down the pipe" with a conduit gesture that presents the cartoon as an object, al­ though we never find such chimericalmonstrosities). Again, the effort of making the gesture have one form ofpragmatic content and the utter­ ance a different one appears to be too great for this kind ofmismatch to occur during running speech.

Alternative Hypotheses
The hypothesis ofthis book is thatgesture andspeech arise from a single process ofutterance formation. The utterance has both an imagistic side and a linguistic side. The image arises first and is transformed into a com-

30

Setting the Stage

plex structure in which both the gesture and the linguistic structure are integral parts. The early signalling of the image in the preparation phase is one piece of evidence in support of this theory. The integration of the stroke with the utterance itself is another piece of evidence. That is, the image that is signaled in gesture preparation is tightly linked a moment later with the articulation of speech and the expression of semantic and pragmatic content. It is tightly linked despite its fundamentally different character from speech as a symbol. If the image is the primitive form of the utterance and the stroke is part of the utterance performance, we can account for the progression: a preparation phase that is separate from speech, and then the stroke phase that is integrated into speech.
Nonetheless, it is not difficult to imagine alternative hypothesesto this proposition. I have already briefly mentioned one-viz., the hypothesis that the full sentence is planned in advance during the gesture prepara­ tion phase-and I will now discuss it and several others. Such a method seems appropriate whether or not the reader also has thought of these hypotheses, since replying to them will clarify the hypothesis of a single process underlying speech and gesture.

THE SHARED PROCESS IS VERBAL. This is one version of the hypothesis of an advance sentence plan. According to it spontaneous gestures, along with speech, are generated from a common plan and this is the verbal plan of the utterance:
Speech
/ Covert Verbal Plan
'" Gesture
I can think of four replies to this hypothesis. First, from this theory one cannot explain the global-synthetic form of gestures. They should be linear-segmented if they are produced from a covert verbal plan.
Second, where covert linear-segmented verbal plans have been postu­ lated (e.g., Sternberg et al. 1978) there has been an experimental pro­ cedure in which speakers were repeating verbal materials verbatim from memory; this is not planning the content of the utterance but planning only a succession of phonetic shapes. Such a verbal plan is precisely one that excludes all basis for gestures.
Third, from this theory we cannot explain the division of meaning be­ tween the gesture and speech channels as in (1.2). If there is a meaning in the gesture channel, it must have come from the covert verbal plan and

THE GESTURE TRANSLATES THE SENTENCE. This is another version of

the advance sentence plan hypothesis. It runs as follows. The visual­

actional �edium of the gesture has its own qualities, but these do not charactenze the psychological structure of the sentence. There are in fact two psychological structures. The sentence medium has one characteris­

tic set of qualities (linear and segmented), and the gesture medium has

another set (global and synthetic or imagistic). The gesture is parasitic on

examples of mutual complementarity can be multiplied many fold.

Setting the Stage

Assume that gestures are copies ofsentences. Thenwehave a situation that we can diagram as follows:

Speech -?> Gesture However, there is no possibility of complementarity with this arrange­ ment. Everything in gesture must have come from speech. Thus if a meaning appears in gesture, it must appear in speech as well. The same argument applies to the opposite diagram, with speech copying gesture (a more appropriate hypothesis in any case, in view ofthe anticipationof speech by gesture) :

Gesture -?> Speech

In this case everything in speech must have come from gesture, but this

also is contradicted by the phenomenon ofmutual complementarity.

The DAF experiments in chapter 10 demonstrate that complexity rep­

resentation spontaneously shifts from the speech to the gesture channel.

The Speech -?> Gesture model is ruled out by this shift, since ifthe speech

channel is blocked by DAF there is no way the gesture channel can take

difference between gestures and manual signs in a true linguistic system

such as ASL. I will devote the entire second chapter to the contrast be­

tween spontaneous gesture and signs. For the present, I will just state

that ASL signs are segmented, combinatoric, context-stable, etc., while

ventions. Thus, ifgestures were copies of speech, they would make the

context-stable unstable, the segmented global, the combinatoric syn­

thetic, and so on. To suppose that gesture is a copy ofspeechin a different

medium simply overlooks the enormous complexity of such a change.

Instead, I believe that gesture and speech manifest different stages of an

evolution ofthe utterance.

Finally, the kinesic medium is pliable and has syntactic potential. This

GESTURES ARE INDEPENDENT VISUAL DISPLAYS. According to this

hypothesis, the gesture is just a separate display exhibited along with the

utterance. It is like a photograph or drawing. And just as holding up a

real photograph would have nothing to do with the process ofutterance

generation, so performing a gesture could have nothing to do with it ei­

ther. The first point in reply is that, unlike a photograph, a gesture is

something the speaker is creating while speaking. Second, the gesture is

photographs usually are not. More crucially, a �esture is structured by meaning, while a photograph is not; the meanlllg of a photograph IS

something we-the observers-bring to it whereas the meaning of a ges­

ture is the foundation of its construction.

A further difference between a gesture and photograph, however, is

that a photograph is disconnected from its original context in time.This

disconnection is indeed the raison popular use of the photograph is

moment and this moment must be included in the meaning of the ges­

ture. We can video a gesture, but we also video its moment. The video

itself is a photograph of sorts and is disconnected from its context in time,

but the gesture, the subject of the video-photograph, is a real entity that

exists only in context. A photograph records scene x at moment y, and

this very fact is its source of significance, as Berger explains: the photo­

graph refers to the past moment and to the recording of it. It means "I

have decided that seeing this is worth recording" (Berger 1972, 179). We

ord it, we replayy too). Performing it at moments z, q, or a is play-acting,

or example-citing.

THE GESTURE IS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG . According to this hypoth­

esis, the global-synthetic gesture is the surface manifestation of what is,

underneath, a sign-a gesture with language-like properties.2 If this is

the case, it is a mistake to infer from the gesture a form of thought that

is global and synthetic. The overt gesture is just the tip of the iceberg.

The rest of the iceberg is more like language, with segmentation of com­

opposed to gestures. However, this hypothesis is empirically unsound. If

the observed global-synthetic gesture is just the tip of the iceberg and

under the "sea of speech" is a more language-like sign, then by "raising

up" the iceberg we should expose more and more langu�ge-like proper­ ties. That is, a simple gesture might be global-synthetIC, but what of

more complex gestures? They might be expected of speech and display more linguistic properties

in different roles or gestures with several internal components, do not bring up latent linguistic structure and are still tied to speech. Complex gestures are global-synthetic all the way down, to keep to the iceberg metaphor. All high-complexity gestures, indeed, show global-synthetic­ meaning properties. Thus, I also feel justified in rejecting the fourth
hypothesis.

Conclusion
Thus, gestures are not the product of a linear-segmented verbal plan, not translations of speech into visual-kinesic form, not like photographs, and not the tip of a linguistically structured iceberg.They are closely linked to speech, yet present meaning in a form fundamentally different from that of speech. My own hypothesis is that speech and gesture are elements of a single integrated process of utterance formation in which there is a synthesis of opposite modes of thought-globaI-synthetic and instanta­ neous imagery with linear-segmented temporally extended verbaliza­ tion. Utterances and thoughts realized in them are both imagery and language.

Conventions) Gestures) and Signs

Introduction
The focus of this book is on the spontaneous and idiosyncratic gestures that occur while one speaks. But it is useful to begin, not with these ges­ tures, but with the more systematic language-like gestures that constitute sign languages. These are signs organized into true linguistic codes. We benefit in this way from the sharp contrast that we can draw between the spontaneous and the socially regulated kinds of gesture. This contrast
wchiallpstterre,nngatmheenly,otnheatotfhme yviasurgaul-mkiennetssicamt tehdeiucmonicslucasipoanbloefotfhheapvrinevgiot�ues
properties of a true language. Therefore, the absence of these propertIes from spontaneous gestures is a meaningful absence; it is a real phenome­ non and can be taken to show a form of thought behind the gesture that is global, synthetic, and imagistic.
The comparison of coded signs and noncoded spontaneous gestures within the same visual-kinesic medium presents a unique view: holding constant the medium, we see what properties of signs are constant and what properties are added by the conventionally structured code. A code implies a systematic structure that is agreed on in advance and main­ tained by a community of users. The necessity of introducing, remem­ bering, maintaining, and agreeing on a code has wide-ranging effects on the forms of the signs themselves. Only certain forms of signs appear in codes, presumably because of the demands placed on signs when they are parts of organized systems. This chapter analyzes these effects on SIgns. The properties of gestures structured under codes should also be true of spoken signs, so the findings of this chapter will have general significance for languages of all kinds.1
Conventional Codes
By a conventional code I mean a general prearranged agreement on the gestures (and other means) that allow individuals to coordinate com­ municative actions, and to achieve intersubjectivity (cf. Lewis 1968). I do not mean that people consciously apply conventions. In the case of language, speakers are generally unconscious of conventions even as they

use them. I also do not mean that conventions are worked out face-to­ face. Linguistic conventions are historical and the essential idea of having a code is precisely that it enables you to know what to do without having
to discuss it.

Kendon)s Continuum
To set the stage I will present an ordering of gestures that was first de­ scribed by Adam Kendon in 1983, and published in 1988 (Kendon 1988a). In his honor, I will call it Kendon's continuum:
Kendon)s continuum:
Gesticulation --7- Language-like Gestures --7- Pantomimes ---7 Emblems---7 Sign Languages
As we move from left to right: (1) the obligatory presence of speech declines, (2) the presence of language properties increases, and (3) idio­ syncratic gestures are replaced by socially regulated signs.
Kendon's continuum is important for sorting out gestures of funda­ mentally different kinds. Many authors refer to all forms of nonverbal behavior as "gesture," failing to distinguish among different categories, with the result that behaviors that differ fundamentally are confused or conBated. (Hecaen 1967, 1978, proposed a scheme that recognized many of the distinctions above, but did not perceive them as falling on a continuum.) I use the term "gesture" in this book specifically to refer to the leftmost, "gesticulation" end of the spectrum.
Gestures in this sense are idiosyncratic spontaneous movements of the hands and arms accompanying speech. An example is the hand rising up­ 'ward while the speaker says "and he climbs up the pipe." Gestures (ges­ ticulation) almost never occur in the absence of speech. "Language-like gestures" are similar in form and appearance to gesticulation but differ in that they are grammatically integrated into the utterance; an example is "the parents were all right, but the kids were [gesture]," where the ges­ ture fills the grammatical slot of an adjective. In pantomime the hands depict objects or actions, but speech is not obligatory. This weakened speech presence locates pantomime in the middle of Kendon's con­ tinuum. There may be either silence or just inarticulate onomatopoetic sound effects ("whoops!" "click!" etc.). Moreover, successive pan­ tomimes can create sequence-lilee demonstrations, and this is different from gesticulation where successive gestures do not combine. Emblems also occupy the middle area of Kendon's continuum. Which one­ emblem or pantomime-belongs more to the right probably is arbitrary.

38

Setting the Stage

Emblems are the familiar "Italianate" gestures, mostly insults but some of them praise, and virtually all attempts to control other people's behavior (Kendon 1981). Emblems have standards of well-formedness, a crucial
language-like property that gesticulation and pantomime lack. For ex­ ample, the OK sign must be made by placing the thumb and index finger in contact; using the thumb and second finger does not produce the OK sign. Thus emblems must meet standards of well-formedness. Emblems have as their characteristic use production in the absence of speech (in­ deed, this is probably their raison d'etre: they offer a way of getting around speech taboos). Emblems have been described by Efron (1941), Ekman and Friesen (1969), Morris et al. (1979), and Kendon (1981). Sign languages, finally, such as ASL, are full-fledged linguistic systems
with segmentation, compositionality, a lexicon, a syntax, distinctiveness, arbitrariness, standards of well-formedness, and a community of users (see K lima and Bellugi 1979).
These distinctions between the different types of communicative manual actions are crucial. Not only do the different types of movements bear different logical and behavioral relations to speech, they also are af­ fected differently following cerebral lesions. Thus highly codified sign languages such as ASL may be disrupted in ways that result in sign apha­ sias much like the aphasias observed in speaking patients (Poizner, Klima, and Bellugi 1987). Emblems and pantomimes might replace or supplement language to the extent that linguistic capacities remain to be exploited via another channel. Production of emblems and pantomimes, which are often tested in an attempt to quantify gestural skills (see Peterson and Kirshner 1981 for a review) do not vary systematically with the type of aphasia, but seem to be related to overall severity of the com­ municative deficit. Gesticulation bears a more complex relationship to speech, and varies in subtle and intricate ways in relation to the speech it
accompanies (see chap. 12). The changes that talce place along Kendon's continuum have wide­
spread consequences for the structure of the gestures themselves, con­ sidered both individually and in their collective relationships to each other. In particular, there is development of

segmentation: meaning complexes are analyzed into segments. compositionality: meaning complexes are constructed by combining
segments. a lexicon: segments recur in the same form in different contexts. a syntax: combinations of segments adhere to standard patterns. paradigmatic oppositions: segments are organized into contrasting sets.

Conventions, Gestures, and Signs

39

distinctiveness: details are added to the form of segments solely to distin­
guish segments from other segments. arbitrariness: segments are used to refer to entities and events in contexts
where their iconicity is ruled out. utterance-like timing: segments are produced with a timing that reveals
them to be the final temporal stage of the process of utterance con­
struction, rather than the utterance's primitive form. standards of form: signs and/or combinations of signs are held to stan­
dards of form. a community of users: a community exists that understands the signs and
sign combinations without perpetual metalinguistic explanation.

We will analyze these properties in this chapter. The accompanying
chart (table 2.1) summarizes the examples and the language-like proper­
ties found in each. An important system of gestures organized into their own code is the
sign language of the deaf, known in North America as ASL, or American Sign Language (see Klima and Bellugi 1979 for a description). There
have been many linguistically oriented studies of ASL, including IUima and Bellugi (1979), Stokoe (1960, 1972), Frishberg (1975), Friedman (1977), Siple (1978), Lane and Grosjean (1980), Liddell (1980),
Marschark et al. (1986), and Supalla (to appear)-to give a sample. Another gesture language is that of the women of the Warlpiri, an ab­
origine people living in the north central Australian desert (Kendon
1988b). (I will refer to this language as WSL.) It is the custom among the Warlpiri, as among several other aborigine groups in this region, for women to forgo speech when they are in mourning, and at certain other times as well. When they are under these speech bans, the complex sign
language of W SL is used. W SL also is used as a convenient alternative means of communication even when speech is ritually permitted, and then it may be used as an accompaniment to speech during storytelling

and animated talk. W hen signs and speech are executed concurrently, we can investigate the timing of the two channels-invaluable for inferring the internal dynamics of conventional signs. Information on this point is
not available from any other source. WSL, like the other sign languages in use among aborigine groups in this part of Australia, was developed among speakers-hearers, and thus can be directly influenced by spoken
language in a way that the sign languages of the deaf, such as ASL, cannot.
A third situation is the spontaneous emergence of gesture systems in children who have not been exposed to a usable language model of any kind. These are deaf children of hearing parents who themselves do not know ASL or any other gesture system (Goldin-Meadow 1982).
A fourth example is emblems, or Italianate gestures. Emblems are but
a partial code, but they still show changes of form and timing compared to spontaneous gesticulation.
Finally, I will describe an experiment in which a hearing subject (called
"Danny" by the experimenter), a college student naive to any kind of sign language, invented a gesture code when he was asked to communicate a fairy story without the use of speech (Bloom 1979). All of these �itua­ tions provide examples of signs at rightward locations on Kendon's con­ tinuum, and their properties can be compared to those of spontaneous gestures in speaking subjects.
The two ends of Kendon's continuum-and the different kinds of ges­ tures that arise there-are related to speech in fundamentally different ways. Most crucially, spontaneous gestures and socially conventional signs have opposite relationships to the internal temporal dimension of utterances. While spontaneous gestures can be taken to reveal the utter­ ance's primitive stage, conventional signs, even when they are gestural, are thefinal stage of their utterances. Comparing the properties of two
ends of the continuum thus allows us to see the contrasting properties of utterances at the beginning and end of the utterance's internal evolution. The end stage is open to socio-cultural specification and control, whereas the inner symbols of the primitive stage are not. One supposes that for the deaf and others who make use of conventional sign languages the
primitive stages of their sentences also include global-synthetic images, just as in the case of spoken languages, but their signs, unlike the spon­ taneous gestures of the hearing, do not, cannot, reflect this stage. The kinesic-visual medium is grammatical and socially regulated for the deaf, and this shifts the overt performance of deaf signers to the final stage of
the internal temporal evolution of utterances.

Conventions, Gestures, and Signs

41

Nonlinguistic Properties of Gesticulation
I have already mentioned in chapter 1 ways in which the gesticulation end of the continuum is unlike language. I will just summarize the prop­ erties of spontaneous speech-accompanying gestures:

GLOBAL AND SYNTHETIC. The meanings of the parts of a gesture are determined by the whole ( = global), and different meaning segments are synthesized into a single gesture ( = synthetic). The global-synthetic property contrasts with the combinatoric linear-segmented property of speech and sign language.

NONCOMBINATORIC. Gestures don't combine to form larger, hierar­ chically structured gestures. Most gestures are one to a clause, but when there are successive gestures within a clause, each corresponds to an idea unit in and of itself.

CONTEXT-SENSITIVE. Precisely because gestures are not constrained by the requirements of a code or language, they are free to incorporate only the salIent and relevant aspects of the context. Each gesture is created at the moment of speaking and highlights what is relevant, and the same entity can be referred to by gestures that have changed their form. This proI?erty is shown by comparing a single speaker 's gestures for an entity 111 dlfferent contexts, where the form of the gesture shifts to highlight different contextual aspects. For example, in one context the hand rises up and points, for the character climbing; in a later context it opens and forms a hollow space, for the character swallowing the bowling ball (see lines 28 and 33, respectively, of the narrative in chapter 3 ) . The property of context-sensitivity contrasts with the stability of lexical forms in a lin­ guistic system-forms recur and combine with other forms to present
modifications of the core meaning in all contexts but do not give up their
basic form in this process.

Setting the Stage

TIMING. Gestures are integrated into the speech output. They antici­ pate the speech in their preparation phase, and synchronize with it in the stroke phase, which is timed to end at or before, but not after, the peak syllable. WSL signs produced with speech, on the other hand, tend to lag behind speech and then catch up at the start ofthe next idea unit. Since WSL signs, along with speech, are socially regulatedfinal products ofa speech process, they do not have the constant temporal relationship to speech of spontaneous gestures.
These are some of the nonlinguistic properties of gestures. In ali respects-that spontaneous gestures are global-synthetic, noncom­
binatoric, context-sensitive, idiosyncratic in form, and timed both to an­ ticipate and to synchronize with speech-spontaneous gestures differ from gestures organized into a code.

In this section I will illustrate the rightward end of Kendon's continuum with examples drawn from ASL, WSL, and the gestures of deaf children who have not been exposed to a language. This way of presenting the material does not give a picture of the sign languages themselves'since each language is divided among different topics. Nevertheless some idea ofeach sign language will emerge; more systematic descriptions ofASL and WSL are to be found in the sources cited above (in addition to WSL, Kendon 1988a provides valuable surveys of a number ofother sign lan­ guages, including the Plains Sign Language of nineteenth-century North America; for this language, see also Umiker-Sebeok and Sebeok 1978, and West 1960).
Each of the following properties will be illustrated with examples: segmentation and combination (ASL, deafchildren), lexicon formation (deaf children), a syntax with paradigmatic oppositions (deaf children), distinctiveness (WSL), arbitrariness (deaf children, ASL, WSL), stan­ dards ofwell formedness (deaf children, WSL), and timing (WSL). Ex­ amples could be provided from other sign languages, but the main points will be sufficiently demonstrated with these illustrations.
Segmentation and Combination
It malces sense to consider segmentation and combination together, since the evidence for one is simultaneously evidence for the other.

SEGMENTATION AND COMB INATION IN DEAF CHILDREN . A compell­ ing example of segmentation-combination is exhibited by a deaf child
not exposed to a usable sign language whom I will describe in a moment.

However, first a word in general about such children. Deaf children exposed to ASL from birth acquire ASL as their native language, in much the same way that hearing children acquire their spoken language (Newport and Meier 1985). Petitto and Marentette ( 1991 ) document
l�nguage milestones in the learning of ASL at the appropriate ages, in­ cluding the emergence of syllabic babbling before the first birthday. Sim­ ilarly, hearing children ofdeafparents who are exposed to ASL also learn
ASL as a native language. However, deaf children of hearing parents who do not use ASL often have great difficulty acquiring any language natively. They cannot hear their parents' speech, and the parents do not have a visual sign language the children could acquire. Such children de­ vise linguistic systems oftheir own based on spontaneous gestures. These gesture languages are called "home signs" by deaf people, and have been the subject ofextensive research by Susan Goldin-Meadow and her col­
leagues (Goldin-Meadow 1982; Goldin-Meadow and Feldman 1977; Goldin-Meadow and Mylander, to appear b; Mylander and Goldin­
Meadow, to appear). Deaf children not exposed to linguistic models display a remarkable
linguistic inventiveness. Although they receive no examples oflanguage they include linguistic properties in their gestures. These properties set their performance far apart from the gestures that accompany the speech
ofhearing persons. It is clear that the linguistic properties arise from the children themselves. Goldin-Meadow andMylander ( 1983, 1984, to ap­ pear a, to appear b) have demonstrated that the parents' gestures are radi­ cally different from the deafchildren's in lacking both the children's form
(morphology) and rules of combination (syntax). The segmentation example came about in this manner. The child (a
little boy known as David) was operating a toy and wanted the experi­ menter to put a penny down on the floor. His gesture for this was a downward motion with his hand in a ring shape (like the OK sign). In itself this could be a global-synthetic gesture presenting the shape and
trajectory as an unanalyzed whole. The experimenter pretended not to understand. After several repetitions, the child (about three years old) factored the gesture into its components: first he statically held up the sign for a small round object ( the OK shape) and then, quite deliberately and with his hand no longer in the OJ( shape but exhibiting a flat palm, made the trajectory for downward movement. The original gesture was thus decomposed into two elements. This example implies the presence of a system of linguistic segments in which the complex meaning of "small-round-thing-moving-downward" is broken into components and the components lawfully combined into a word. That is, the child's

44

Setting the Stage

gestures-unlike the spontaneous gesticulations of hearing subjects­ are complexes ofsimpler gesture elements.
This particular combination was one among many in David's lan­ guage, for indeed the child had devised a morphemic system. Systematic compositionality ofsigns within a system ofcontrasts is crucial evidence ofsegmentation and combination. For example, he used a fist shape com­
bined with a single arc for repositioning small long objects by hand, such as sticks. The same handshape could be combined with a to-and-fro movement, and this indicated a stick swinging back and forth. Thus, the fist shape had the consistent meaning of "handling a small long object." Similarly, movement in a single arc had the meaning of repositioning something. These are examples of basic morphemic segments into which
the child analyzed complex meanings. Moreover, the expressive power was doubled by giving each mor­
pheme a different meaning depending on the perspective ofthe gesture. For example, arcing to-and-fro would mean swinging a long thin object by hand when it was a Hand morpheme (the viewpoint ofa "character," cf. chap. 4) butwould mean repositioning a bulky object in a circle when it was an Object morpheme (the viewpoint ofan "observer," cf. chap. 4). The Hand morpheme involves the hand playing the part of a hand, in

which case the hand appears to be grasping a long thin object, while in
the Object morpheme the hand is playing the part ofthe object itself, and the hand configuration appears to depict a bullcy object. Tables 2.2 and
2.3 show David's morphemes ofshape (with two viewpoints) and move­ ments (based on Mylander and Goldin-Meadow's tables 2 and 4).
The motion and handshape morphemes, finally, were combined to form complex meanings. For instance, the Arcing To and Fro morpheme combined 28 times with the Fist morpheme (in the Hand morpheme category), compared to combining with Flat palm only 8 times, a differ­ ence that very likely corresponds to the number of opportunities a small child has for repositioning small long objects compared to repositioning large flat surfaces. In any case it reflects his use ofthe morpheme structure
to analyze event structure. The above are combinations of morphemes. Compositionality also
appeared at the sentence level. For example, pointing at a jar ( = reference to the jar) followed by a twisting gesture ( = twisting the lid) was used to request that the j ar lid be taken off. This compositionality also implies segments and hierarchical structuring-pointing was one segment, which indicated the topic ofthe child's statement, and twisting the other;
together they formed a unified structure. I will describe these word-level segmentations in the section dealing with the lexicon, below.

SEGMENTATION AND COMBINATION IN ASL. In ASL, too, there is seg­ mentation and combination. A particularly striking example was pre­
sent�d by Klima and Bellugi ( 1 979). The sign for "slow" is made by movmg one hand across the back of the other hand. The movement is

46

Setting the Stage

performed slowly, and thus iconically demonstrates slowness. However, when the sign is modified to be "very slow" it is made more rapidly (Klima and Bellugi 1 979). In ASL, that is, modifying the meaning ofa sign can reduce its iconicity. In contrast, the addition ofsemantic information to a spontaneous gesture always increases its iconicity-if something is thought ofas very slow, the gesture for it is alsovery slow. InASL there is a systematic way of showing intensification in general, which is by mak­
ing the adjective sign more rapidly:

Intensification = Adjective + Rapid Execution

This rule is the language's way ofanalyzing an intensification ofa quality into two components: an adjective and sign of intensity. The composi­
tion method is the reverse ofthe nonanalytic expression ofmeaning via a global-synthetic gesture.
Creating a neologism is another example of composition. Consider the ASL word for a streaker (the name of one who runs unclothed
through a public place-a fad in the late 1970s). In ASL this comes out something like "nude-zooms off" (Klima and Bellugi 1979). Here two signs combine into one. The sign for "zoom off" is made by moving the
hand forward and simultaneously changing the shape from open to closed. To get "streaker" the hand moves forward, as in a normal "zoom off," but the motion starts out with the handshape of"nude." So the new word is formed out ofa combination of"nude" and "zoom off."
A third example is the interconversion ofnouns to verbs andvice versa (Supalla and Newport 1978). To make a noun out of a verb in ASL, the
sign is performed in a restrained manner and repeated, but otherwise the
sign is unchanged. The rule is

Noun = Verb + Restraint and Repetition

For example, "to fly" is made by moving the hand once forward with the thumb, forefinger and pinkie extended, the other fingers curled in; "air­ plane" is this same shape and movement but the movement is repeated and made in a smaller space. Again, there is analysis and rule-governed combination : an object-word is derived from an action-word by combin­ ing the action-word with a generalized sign of objecthood-restraint and repetition. The relationship between an airplane and flying is thus built into the language. The same kind ofderivation exists for many other verbs and nouns in ASL: in every case the noun is the verb but repeated
and made in a restricted space; thus,

Conventions, Gestures, and Signs

47

Verb (unrestrained, not repeated)
fly sweep iron (V) sit hammer (V)

Noun (restrained, repeated)
airplane broom iron (N) chair hammer (N)

Spoken English also has such pairs as "hammer" (verb, noun) and "iron" (verb, noun) and many others, but these have identical forms and do not manifest the kind ofsystematic shift we see in ASL. A closer English par­ allelwould be the regular pattern ofstress shift that accompanies the con­ version ofverbs to nouns-"record" to "record" for example.
The unique qualities ofASL arise from the ability ofthe language to use movements, shapes, and space that are iconic in some contexts and exploit them for wider grammatical purposes. The word for a streaker was ordered as "nude" and "zoom off." The very structure of the word shows what to do-disrobe and zoom off, in that order-but the result is a word ofASL, not a pantomime. The adjective intensification rule takes the intensification ofmotion that is iconic in some contexts and uses it in all contexts, without regard to iconicity. The derivation of nouns from verbs also grammaticizes iconicity, in that the kinesic features added to a verb to make the noun (restraint and repetition) convey objecthood (something static and repeatable). The ASL linguistic system thus offers numerous illustrations ofhow iconic gestures are restructuredwhen they become parts of a linguistic code.
A Lexicon
The signs that are used to carve up complex meanings and then recon­ stitute the meanings through combinations must also be stable and re­ callable, and this implies a lexicon. Both deaf children and ASL clearly have lexicons. The children are the more interesting, since their system is closer to spontaneous gesticulation, and this highlights the changes that come about when gestures are stabilized in a lexicon. Moreover, their lex­ icon is their own invention, and thus manifests what Susan Goldin­ Meadow calls the "resilient" properties of language, the properties of language that are capable of development under conditions of deprived input (Goldin-Meadow 1 982). . The children's lexicon is organized into two classes, referring signs and characterizing signs. Referring signs are various kinds of pointing

of characterizing signs. Pointing gestures are used to refer to people,

WatI. tehncnoomupnasss(Ftehledmsamane,

Goldin-Meadow, and Gleitman 1978). Pointing thus seems to be the

deaf child's noun category. Further evidence that pointing is part of the

system ofsigns for deafchildren is that it undergoes systematic develop­

ment (Butcher 1989; Butcher et al., to appear). Pointing for the child at a

young age is literal, concrete deixis-pointing at real objects in the im­

mediate environment. These points may or may not yet be lexical words.

An example is pointing at the battery compartment of a toy, and then

pointing at the batteries (asking for the batteries to be put in). Later the

child points to objects similar to the intended object when the intended

object is not in view. This distancing from the here-and-now is more

clearly like a noun. For example, David pointed to a box of Christmas

tree balls, and then pointed at an empty corner of the room (where the

Christmas tree is usually placed, but not at the moment). Another form

of abstract pointing is to point at a perceptually similar object. For e'Xam­

ple, David touched a picture of a toy train track, then pointed through

the floor to the basement, to refer to a toy train in the basement of his

grandparents' house. A third stage carries the abstraction further. The

child becomes able to designate a space and point at it to stand for an

object. This is like the use ofabstract space by adult narrators. An example

is making a movement in space for hanging something, then making an

O-shape in the same space, and finally pointing to a spot on this 0. The

reference is to an absent Christmas tree ornament. In all of this develop­

ment, a stable gesture form recurs in wider and ever more abstract con­

texts, showing some ofthe essential properties ofa lexical word.

The characterizing signs, the stylized pantomimes, correspondingly,

are the child's verb and adjective categories (with no apparent distinction

between verbs and adjectives). An example (verb) is the gesture for "eat­

ing," which is pantomimic and made by holding a fist near the mouth and

making chewing movements. An example of an adjective is "round," an

O-hand (the gesture used, for example, to describe the Christmas tree

ornament).

structures, deletions of clements as a function of semantic complexity, and their ability to form complex structures. The patterning of the chil­ dren's sign sentences, moreover, suggests an ergative structure, a gram­
matical pattern that is often seen in gesture derived languages but is fundamentally different from the English of the children's parents.

PREDICATE STRUCTURE. Predicate structures were revealed in the fol­ lowing ways: ( 1 ) Gesture sequences expressed the semantic relations typically found in early hearing child utterances, with characterizing gestures fulfilling the role ofthe predicate; for example "Mickey" (point) "walle' (walking movements with hands). (2) The mean length ofutter­ ance (MLU) increased systematically with age, as in hearing children, im­ plying that expanding the length of sentences is not just adding words
but is an extension ofstructural possibilities and thus part of a develop­ mental process. (3) The order ofthis development was the same as with hearing children: first a one-word stage when they produced just one gesture at a time; then two-gesture sequences; finally complex sentences, in which the relationships between gestures were similar to those in speech (coordination, temporal sequence, and subordination).

DELETION REGULARITIES. At the two-gesture stage, characterizing gestures (verbs) whose meanings implied one, two, or three logical argu­ ments (agent, object, recipient) had different probabilities of including the different arguments. Specifically, the larger the number ofimplicit ar­ guments, the lower the probability ofincluding a gesture for the agent. A systematic regularity in selecting arguments also implies a syntax. It im­ plies a structure within which the arguments arc differentiated and rank­ ordered in terms of importance. With a one-argl1l11ent verb such as "sleep" or "dance," an agent was usually included; this produces a se­
quencethat stays within the general two-sign limit oflength. With a two­ argument verb, such as "eat" or "go," the probability of the agent was lower, the two slots being given to the action and direct object ("cheese
eat"). With a three-argument verb like "give," the probability of an ex­ plicit agent was very low, the two positions in the sentence being turned over to the action and the recipient ("give me") or the direct object and recipient ("cheese me"). Although limited to two gestures, the children do not select the two randomly, but follow a systematic principle to select
the most informative arguments. Ordering regularities also appear in the deaf children's two-sign se­
quences in that only halfofthe logical possibilities appear: object-action (cheese + eat), object-recipient (hat + head), and action-recipient

50

Setting the Stage

(move-to + table), but not action-object, recipient-object, or recipient­ action. Again, this suggests an underlying system that allows some com­ binations and outlaws others.

ERGATIVE STRUCTURES. Being unconstrained by adult models (models that for these children would have been of the accusative type), the chil­ dren devised ergative patterns that would not be found in the deyelop­ ment of hearing children in the same environment.2 They had 'many sentences like the following:

"boy run" (intransitive agent, i.e., "the boy runs") "boy hit" (transitive object, i.e., "hits the boy"),

but few sentences like:

"hit girl" or "girl hit" (transitive agent, i.e., "the girl hits").

This is ergative-like ih that the case treated as unique is the transitive
agent. It is an ergative-like deletion pattern, and it appeared with all the deafchildren in Goldin-Meadow's study. With one child (the remarkable David) there also was an ergative inclusion pattern. David provided a suf­ ficient number oftransitive agent sentences for this analysis to be carried out, and in these sentences he tended to put gestures for the transitive agent after the verb. This arrangement contrasted with gestures for the
transitive object and the intransitive agent, which he placed before the verb. Thus David came close to an explicit ergative system:

"boy run" (intransitive agent, "the boy runs") "boy hit" (transitive object, "hits the boy") "hit boy" (transitive agent) "the boy hits").

2. In an ergative language the ergative case is the unique case and is given to the transi­ tive agent; the intransitive agent and transitive object are treated in the same uniform way, different from the ergative, and are called the absolutive case. This contrasts with an accu­ sative language, such as English, where the unique case is the transitive object, called the accusative, and the two agents, transitive and intransitive, are treated in the same uniform way, called the nominative case. Examples ofergative languages are Georgian or Warlpiri. To see the accusative pattern in English, it is necessary to look at the one place where case marking exists: "he sleeps," "he cuts the cheese"-intransitive and transitive agents, respec­ tively, both marked with the nominative case; and "the girl hits him"-direct object in the accusative case.

Conventions, Gestures, and Signs

51

Ergative-like arrangements are patterns that appear repeatedly i n ges­ tures, including gestures invoked experimentally in adult hearing sub­
jects (Bloom 1 979, described later in this chapter). The most convincing explanation ofsuch gestural ergativity is that by Tuite (n.d.). In gesture, he observed, the configuration ofthe hand can convey the properties of the arguments ofthe verb. Since an intrinsic part ofthe gesture, its hand configuration, is used to convey these arguments, the gesture naturally favors including semantic roles that are most closely linked to the verb, namely, the intransitive agents and transitive objects. This produces the ergative-like pattern. In ergative languages, such as Georgian, the cases divide along lines of being more closely linked to the verb (the absolu­
tive) and less closely linked (the ergative) . In accusative systems, in
contrast, the cases cut across this semantic grouping. The nominative in­ cludes one closely linked role, the intransitive agent, together with the less closely linked role, the transitive agent, while the accusative includes the other closely linked role, the transitive object. For this reason, ges­ tures are unlikely to take on accusative structures, but, following intrinsic
semantic groupings, can and do emerge with ergative-like structures.

COMPLEX SENTENCES. Finally, deaf children are able to form complex
sentences out of simple sentences. The combinations are based on spe­ cific semantic relationships (coordination, temporal sequences, and rela­ tive clause subordination). As in hearing children exposed to language models, complex sentences do not emerge immediately but only after an
extended period ofdevelopment. Coordination is the semantic relationship in this example :

Points at Mickey Mouse + swinging pantomime + walking pantomime, i.e., "Mickey swings and wall(s" (action ofa toy).

Temporalsequence is the semantic relationship in this example:

Points at tower + hitting pantomime + falling over pantomime, i.e., "I hit the tower and it falls over" (action ofselfon a toy).

Finally, a complexNP through subordination ofa relative clause is the se­ mantic relationship in the following:

"Roundness" + points at penny + points at self, i.e., "give me the penny that is round."

52

Setting the Stage

To gloss this as a relative clause assumes that the child employs here his usual lexical distinction between characterizing signs (for predicates) and pointing signs (for nominals). Ifthis is the correct analysis, the sentence was predicating two propositions (i.e., penn)� give; penny, round), one
of them subordinate to the other. The deaf children thus found ways to relate sentences to each other,
through coordination, temporal sequences, and (possibly) subordina­
tion, and thus to create complex sentences.

SUMMARY OF SYNTAX. The emergence of a syntax is spontaneous in these deaf children. They show a capacity to create predicate structures, select the most informative elements from larger underlying structures, organize sentence constituents into grammatical patterns (which is the ergative pattern), and construct complex sentences out of simple sen­ tences. There was no instruction or even clue given by the parents that gestures could be structured in these ways and such combinations do not occur in the parents' own gestures.

D istinctiveness
Signs in a linguistic system may have details added to them solely to dis­ tinguish them from other signs. The additions have no semantic motiva­ tion and existjust to make the sign distinguishable from other signs with which it might be confused. Distinctiveness is convincing evidence ofin­ corporating gestures into a linguistic system.
Kendon ( 1 988b) gives manyexamples ofdistinctiveness in WSL. The sign for "turaki" (a truck) is made by rotating the forearm into an upward (supine) position. This is performed twice in rapid succession while the hand is held in a kind ofO-shape (the first three fingers curled in toward the thumb) . The added feature is that the pinkie sticks out in a little crook. This has no function other than to keep the sign distinct from an­ other sign, "kurdu" (child), which is made the same way but with the little finger curled in.
Distinctiveness appears in WSL in other ways. As women learn the sign language, they usually start out with pantomimes and gradually shift to more standard signs. Distinctiveness is apparent at several points in this process. The sign for "playing cards," for example, is performed by older women in the following way: they hold out a single fist-hand and twice rotate it downward with the thumb sticking out. Novices, in con­ trast, pantomime dealing cards: they use two hands, rather than one, and repeatedly move the thumb of one hand along the upright palm of the other hand. The mature sign thus retains some features of the pan-

Gestures, while potentially iconic, are thus capable of arbitrariness.

Howev�r, there must be some reason for disregarding iconicity. If the

code, the code can supply this reason. Spontaneous a code and everything in the gesture-form, space,

movement, etc.-is potentially iconic.

Standards of Wetl-Formedness

There is one recorded instance where David corrected his hearing sister's

performance ofa gesture, andthis implies a standard ofwell-formedness.

from the gestures ofhearing children and adults: the child's movements

are clearly articulated; disciplined, reproducible, and schematic; in all

these respects they are unlike the contextuallyvarying gestures ofhearing

persons, and this also suggests standards.

Standards of well-formedness in other gesture codes are rigorously

applied. To take a familiar example, emblems must adhere to standards

that specify the limits within which the gesture is to be made ifit is to be

recognized. T�e OK sign must be made by contacting the index finger

or altered in the mature sign are often explainable in terms ofstandards of form and the requirement of meeting them.

Timing
Although WSL is meant for silent communication, expert signers also use the sign language when speaking is not prohibited; then they might sign and speak concurrently. This situationprovides anatural experiment on the timing ofone code, gestures, in relation to that ofanother, speech. One ofKendon's ( 1988b) informants, Winnie Nangala, an expert Warl­ piri signer, spontaneously adopted this dual method of communication during the recounting of a story, and her narrative was videotaped. The temporal relationships of signing and speaking are summarized in five points (based on Kendon 1 988b, 305-308) :
1 . Each new speech phrase begins simultaneously with the stro/lc ofthe first sign.
2. The preparation phase ofthe first sign begins beforNpeech. 3 . Speech may be delayed ifit gets ahead ofthe stroke. 4. Late in a speech phase, speech is allowed to get ahead of the stFoke,
and a sign might take place after the speech phrase has been com­ pleted. 5 . The onset ofthe next speech phrase is delayed until the last sign from the preceding phrase is completed.
The first three points are familiar from spontaneous gesticulation, since here, too, the stroke synchronizes with speech and the preparation anticipates speech, and ifsynchrony threatens to break down speech may be delayed. As Kendon writes, these points provide "clear evidence that the planning processes for speech and sign are carried o�t in a cou:pletely integrated fashion. That is to say, spoken forms and SIgned eqmvalents are co-selected and their production is coordinated" (307). This suggests that Winnie's speech and signs had the same primitive stage. The last two points, however, arc quite different from spontaneous gesticulation. They show that, once speech is underway, signs and spontaneous ges­ stupreeeschpraorceeneodtiinndteegpreantdeednitnlyto. Uonnelikpeersfpoornmtaannceeouwshgeersetcuoreexs,pgreesss�ilvreesSI.agnnds and spoken words are presented at the same time. This is a direct con­ sequence of the gestures' belonging to their own linguistic code. The gesture words are seen, not as the accompaniments ofthe verbal message, but as symbols presentingmeanings within theirown system. Moreover, since the planning phases of speech and signs are shared, the separation

55

of the signs and spoken words would occur during the actual perfor­ mance phase when speaking and gesturing are taking place.
The following example is from Winnie Nangala's narrative (based on Kendon 1 988b, 306). The format is that used by Kendon: the first line, in
capitals, is the Warlpiri sign language, each written word corresponding to a different sign; the second line is the gesture time-line showing the preparations and strokes; the third line is the Warlpiri speech; and the fourth line is Kendon's translation into English.

At ( 1 ) and (3), Winnie began new speech phrases. The stroke of the accompanying sign exactly coincided with the spoken word and the preparation phase slightly anticipated it. At (2) and (4), in contrast,

interrupted briefly after (2), the end ofa speech phrase, and this enabled the spoken word "ngangkiri," at (3), to start simultaneously with the stroke of the signed word NGANGKIRI, which was the beginning of the next phrase. Thus, the spoken words and signed words
"rdarri"/RDARRI (grab hold) and "ngangkiri"/NGANGKIRI (hus­ band) seemed to have been part ofthe planning phases ofthe utterances and were planned together, but the spoken words and signed words "marda"lMARDARNI and "nyanu"INYANU unrolled independently
each within its own utterance program.
At least one reason why the timing of signs is different from that of spontaneous gestures is because signs are structured by their own code. They have their own plan of execution and once planned are not inte­ grated with speech into a single performance. This ensures that speech and signs will be temporally related in different ways from speech and spontaneous gestures.

Setting the Stage

Emblems
A widely known type of gesture that shows cultural specificity is the em­ blem, or Italianate gesture.3 Emblems are part ofa social code but are not fully structured as a language. They have names or standard paraphrases, are learned as specific symbols, and can be used as if they were spoken words; in fact they are unspoken words (and phrases) ; but there is no granunar, and emblems are rarely if ever combined. An example of the cultural specificity of emblems is the so-called Hand Purse, in which the fingers and thumb are pressed together at the tips and held upright. This is not in use at all by North Americans and, in Europe, it has six or seven different meanings, depending on the region. In Spain, for example, it has the meaning of "lots of people," in Italy "a query," in Belgium and France "fear," etc. (Morris et al. 1 979). Thus there is extensive cultural determination of this gesture: it doesn't appear at all in some areas, and when it appears it has different uses. In contrast to spontaneous iconics and metaphorics, there is no way to understand the Hand Purse without the appropriate cultural knowledge.
Emblems are signs but the code that structures them is incomplete. Emblems have but limited contrasts andthese exist only for certain indi­ vidual sets of gestures. Emblems show restricted compositionality, and
no real syntax at all; and the functions of emblems fall within a narrow range of speech acts. Emblems nonetheless still have certain language­ like properties. They have segmentation, standards ofwell-formedness, an historical tradition, and a community ofusers that understands them without metalinguistic explanations. All these things considered, em­ blems belong in the middle section ofKendon's continuum.
Probably every society has culturally prescribed emblems, some more than others. Precisely because emblems are culturally specific, they differ from culture to culture, with some societies having quite elaborate em­ blem systems. Sparhawk ( 1976), for example, analyzed more than 200 Persian emblems in use in modern Iran. I will first describe a survey of20 European emblems conducted by Morris et al. ( 1979) and summarize their results. I will add material from Kendon's ( 1981) review of their book, and then present Kendon's analysis of the restricted range of speech acts that emblems characteristically perform. I will conclude this discussion ofemblems with a description ofthe code-like aspects ofem­ blems, including Italianate and Persian.

3. The term "emblem" was used by Ekman and Friesen ( 1969) following Efron ( 1941), who used the term "emblematic gesture" for the same type ofculturally specified gesture form. "Italianate" recognizes the richness of this type of gesture in parts of Italy.

The Survey by Morris et aI.
Morris and his associates ( 1979) traveled across Europe testing local residents for their interpretation of 20 preselected emblems and pho­ tographing people performing them. This very procedure-studying gestures that are specified in advance by form-is possible only at the rightward end of Kendon's continuum. Morris's group present their re­ sults gesture by gesture, giving the geographical distribution ofeach one, its major interpretations and where it appears, comments on the history ofthe gesture, and speculations on the motivation ofthe form ofthe ges­ ture in terms of ancestral iconic forms. Kendon ( 1 9 8 1 ) added to this a number of historical details and an important set of observations on speech act functions.

THE 20 EMBLEMS. A description of the first 1 1 of the emblems, their interrelations, locations, possible iconic origins, and historical notes are given in the following list; this is a combination of information from Morris et al. ( 1979) and Kendon ( 1981). The names ofthe gestures are
from the Morris publication. 1 . The Fingertip Kiss: fingers and thumb contact the pursed lips and
move away, possibly with a puff of air from the mouth at the same time.
This means "praise" in Holland, Belgium, Yugoslavia, and Turkey. It is a salutation in Portugal, Sardinia, Malta, and Corfu. The movement is supposed to evoke the idea ofa mouth kiss (which itselfis considered to derive from feeding movements). The Fingertip Kiss is a gesture ofgreat antiquity, existing for more than 2,000 years. It was common in Greece and Rome, and in Biblical times in the Near East. Greeks and Romans threw kisses when they entered and left a temple, and threw them at sa­
cred objects of various kinds. The gesture gradually shifted from re­ ligious adoration to general praise or salutation.
2. The Fingers Cross: the middle finger crosses over the index finger. This invokes protection in England, Scandinavia, parts of Sicily, and
Yugoslavia. In Corfu and Turkey, in contrast, it means breaking a friend­ ship. Its connection with the "protection" meaning is as a disguised ver­ sion ofthe sign ofthe cross, presumably used as a secret sign, and thus its
origin is not as ancient as the preceding. 3 . The Nose Thumb: the thumb contacts the tip ofthe nose, the fingers
extended and wiggling. This means "mockery" everywhere; in fact, it is the most widely known emblem of the 20 Morris and his group tested. The earliest reference to it is in the fifteenth century. Morris and his group believe the origin of the Nose Thumb may have been an ancient

58

Setting the Stage

practice of making mocking effigies out of wax, which featured long
noses. 4. TheHandPurse: the thumb and fingers are in contact at the tip, the
hand facing upward. This means (as noted earlier) "query" in Italy, Sar­ dinia, and Sicily; "good" in Portugal, Greece, and Turkey; "fear" in Belgium and France; and "emphasis" in Holland and Germany. There is clearly regional grouping of these different meanings, suggesting sepa­ rate historical traditions for the same hand shape. Morris and his group think that the "query," "good," and "emphasis" meanings could have arisen originally from the precision grip (the hand posture for precise
manipulativemovements). The "emphasis" meaning suggests a beat. The Hand Purse is described in a book on Neapolitan gestures by Di Jorio in 1832.
5. The Cheek Screw: the extended index finger touches the cheek and the whole hand rotates back and forth. In Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia this means something that is deemed good to eat. In Germany it means "crazy," which Morris and his group take to be a disguised version of a "crazy" gesture made on the side of the head (a movement that is, they say, illegal as a public gesture in Germany). In its "good to eat" meaning, the movement could have arisen from the expression in Italian al dente 'on the tooth', or just right for eating, and in any case is appropriate for
pointing to the mouth. 6. The EyelidPull: the index finger pulls down the skin under one eye.
In Italy this means "watch out, be alert" and everywhere else it means "I am alert." The one whose alertness is invoked is thus the variable ele­ ment. In either case the gesture exaggerates opening the eye. It too is
mentioned by Di Jorio in 1832. 7. The ForearmJerk: the forearm is pulled up abruptly while the op­
posite hand chops down on the inside crook of the arm. North Ameri­ cans refer to this as the "Italian Salute." Morris and associates describe it as an enhanced version (a "supernormal stimulus") ofthe ancient Roman digitus impudicus. The Forearm Jerk may be no more than a century old, but the digitus impudicus is 2,000 years or more old. Caligula is said to have used it scandalously when he offered his hand to be kissed. The phal­
lic imagery ofthe gesture requires no explanation. S. The Flat-Hand Flick: the fingers of one hand are rapidly drawn to
the front across the back of the other hand. This means "beat it!" in Belgium, France, Italy, and Greece. The gesture is quite iconic, but none­ theless has a standard form in the regions ofits use, and is not recognized as a departure signal elsewhere at all.
9. TheRing: the thumb and first finger in contact at the tips, the other

Conventions, Gestures, and Signs

59

fingers extended. This means OK everywhere exceptTunisia, where it is a threat and in Brazil where it is an insult (a more unfortunate form of polysemy would be hard to imagine). It also means an orifice in Ger­ many, northern Italy, northern Sardinia, and Malta; and it means "zero"
in Belgium, France, and Tunisia. The crucial feature for the OK meaning, Morris and associates believe, is the precision contact·of the first finger and thumb. The traditional explanation is that the gesture is an attempt to form an 0 and a K. However, the earliest reference to the gesture with an OK meaning is in the first century A.D., in a Roman text. The orifice meaning is also ancient, at least 2,000 years old (Greece).
10. The Vertical Horn: the first finger and pinkie are extended, the otherfingers curled in with the thumb on top ofthem; in this version, the palm faces outward. The gesture accuses someone ofbeing a cuckold in
Spain, Portugal, and Italy. It is very ancient, and while the iconic element
in the gesture of depicting horns is clear, the connection of horns them­ selves to cuckoldry remains obscure. The gesture is now restricted to Catholic countries, but it was once widespread throughout Europe.
1 1 . The Horizontal Horn: the same as the Vertical Horn, except that the palm faces down. The gesture also is now an accusation of cuckoldry in the same regions, but had an original meaning of"protection" (ward­
ing offthe evil eye). In Malta and Italy this use ofthe gesture is still quite active. The gesture in this meaning is extremely ancient, Morris and asso­ ciates dating it back 2,500 years or more. The orientation ofthe gesture makes iconic sense for protection, since it is aimed at the source of evil.
These are the first 1 1 of the 20 emblems that Morris and his group tested. The others, without discussing them, are ( 12) The Fig (sexual comment or insult), ( 13 ) The Head Toss (negation or beckoning), ( 14) The Chin Flick (disinterest or negation), ( 1 5 ) The Cheek Stroke (thin and ill), ( 16) Thumb Up (OK), ( 17) The Teeth-Flick (nothing or anger), (IS) TheEar Touch (effeminate or watch out), ( 19) TheNose Tap (secrecy), and
(20) The Palm-Back V-Sign (victory but, in Britain, a sexual insult; the
Churchillean V-for-victory sign carefully has the palm to the front).

COMMENTS ON THE 20 EMBLEMS. In emblems we can see a microcosm of the changes wrought in gestures when they become elements in a so­
cially regulated code. 1 . Distribution. In contrast to the near universality ofspontaneous ico­
nic and metaphoric gestures, there is much regional variation with em­ blems. This variability appears in both the number of emblems that are
recognized and the meanings that they have. Such is just the distribution that would result from separate historical traditions. The importance of

60

Setting the Stage

cultural specification for emblems is evident in another way. The mean­ ings ofemblems vary from place to place, even though the gesture form is
the same. Each cultural region determines a meaning on its own. The Hand Purse is a clear case of such variation. There is no sensible connec­ tion among the "query," "good," or "fear" meanings, and to these can be added "slowly" (Tunisia), "large quantity" (Spain), and "emphasis" (Holland, Germany). This kind of wide variation among regions com­ bined with stability ofmeaning in each region is possible only by conven­
tions that are culturally reinforced. 2. Iconicity. Nonetheless, the different cultural varieties of emblems
could still stem from a common core. Kendon (1981) argued that em­ blems do not arise from other emblems, but in many cases could have
begun as iconic gestures which then were ritualized and stabilized as part of a gesture code. Consistent with this idea is the preservation of an ele­ ment oficonicity in many ofthe emblems described by Morris and asso­ ciates. This iconicity seems to have little essential role in the gesture's current function, this function being carried by the recognition of the gesture as part of a code. But the iconic element remains-a vestige of the emblem's past. The Finger Tip Kiss, for example, iconically depicts emanations from the lips toward the object ofpraise: it would misfire if one were to malce the movement offto the side toward some other object.
The Fingers Cross iconically depicts the Christian Cross; the Nose Thumb depicts an elongated nose; the Hand Purse depicts a precision grip on something small, and this metaphorically presents the ideas of "query" and "excellence" (however, the "fear" meaning is not explained this way). The Cheek Screw actually points to the locus ofsomething that has excellent taste. The Eyelid Pull, Forearm Jerk, Flat-Hand Flick, and the two Horn-Signs all contain iconic elements. The Ring depicts a pre­
cision grip and this could metaphorically present the abstract meaning of sufficiency and adequacy (OK). The Teeth Flick for anger enacts biting (one's own thumbnail). Some of the others, however, seem to lack ico­ nicity, at least any now discernible. The Chin Flick for "disinterest" or "negation" seems wholly arbitrary as far as one can tell.
3 . Historical longevity. One of the most impressive findings from the investigation ofemblems is their extraordinary longevity. While no spo­ ken languages have lasted unchanged since Roman times, a number of
emblem gestures are Roman and some are older tl1an that. We apparently would have no difficulty malcing ourselves understood to a legionnaire if all we wanted was to say OK or offer a sexual insult. Kendon (198 1 ) at­
tributes this great stability overhistorical time to the absence ofcomposi­ tionality: emblems can change only as wholes and this encourages

T

Conventions, Gestures, and Signs

61

conservatism since there is no way for historical processes to chip away bits of emblems, the way they can erode bits of spoken symbols, without having the entire gesture change or lose its meaning. A striking illustra­ tion ofthe historical stability ofemblems is the HeadToss with the mean­ ing ofnegation. This gesture appears in Italy south ofthe Volturno River near Naples, whereas north of this river negation is conveyed with the familiar Head Wag (Morris et al. 1979). The same Head Toss gesture meaning negation also appears in Greece and nowhere else. It thus ap­ pears to have been a gesture of Greek origin. What is remarkable is that the southern region ofItalywas colonized by the Greeks in the seventh or eighth century B.C., and the Head Toss for negation apparently dates from then. Once settled in, tucked behind a natural barrier, it neither
spread out nor changed for all these centuries.

Code-like Properties
Emblems comprise a partial code, as I mentioned earlier. They are seg­ ments, are lexicalized, have standard forms, belong to historical tradi­ tions, have arbitrary or ritualized uses, and are understood by a community of users. The code is partial, however, because emblems lack the crucial linguistic property of compositionality. There are however two cases of limited compositionality with emblems, and these excep­ tions I will describe below. Sparhawk ( 1976) described sentence-like combinations of Persian emblems, and the familiar European emblems of beckoning and waving appear to be gestural words composed out of quasi-morphological elements.
Sentence-lifee compositionality with Persian emblems. Sparhawk ( 1976) found rare occurrences of topic-comment and comment-comment se­ quences ofemblem gestures. The topic-comment sequences followed the SOY order that is common in Persian clause roots but also is identical to the preferred sequence ofconstituents in the signing ofdeafchildren not exposed to linguistic models. Some examples of these topic-comment "sentences" :

"talks too much" : moves lips + sign for "a lot" "what time is itt": points at watch + sign for "don't know" "give me a cigarette" : taps extended fingers on lips + sign for "give"

Despite these examples, Sparhawk regards emblems as fundamentally laclcing compositionality: her informants also stressed that emblems
were used singly rather than in sequence. The regulation of gesture se­ quences does not appear to be part of the standard repertoire. She says,

MORPHEME-LIKE COMPOSITIONALITY WITH WAVING. In northern

Europe and North America, to beckon someone you point your hand up

and turn its palm toward yourself: this is UP and HIDE (meaning the

hand is pointing up and the palm is hidden fr?m whoever is being sum­

you you

are seeing off: UP and SHOW. Morns and assoClates present these facts,

and we can see that there is a certain iconicity in the orientation of the

palm in these gestures. If the palm surface is thought of as facing the locus

of the addressee, then you beckon by turning this locus towards you, and

you wave goodbye by turning it away fromy?u. Thus the g�sture rotates

in the northern beckoning emblem, we can see agam that there may be

something iconic in the hidden palm for beckoning, but there also is

something deictic in the downward orientation of the hand. This could

be understood as pointing at the ground where the new locus of the ad­

dressee should be. In Italy, waving goodbye is yet different: the hand

points up but the and HIDE. Since

distinctive, which set the emblems apart. Given the remarks above, we can say that in northern Europe the principle of distinguishing beckon­ ing and waving is the iconic use of the hand to depict a trajectory. In Italy the principle is the deictic use of the hand to indicate a locus near or far from the speaker. In the rest of the Mediterranean region, both iconicity and deixis seem to be involved and the gestures convey beckoning and waving redundantly.
NOVEL FORMS OF WAVING. If this compositionality of emblems is true, it should be possible to find novel forms of beckoning and waving in which gestures depart from canonical waves or beckons but preserve standards of form by honoring the semantic features of the system. I have observed a case of waving goodbye in which the SHOW dimension (the northern European system) was realized in a novel form. The person doing the waving was driving a car past the addressee; the addressee was standing to the left (the driver's side). Thus there were two lines in con­ flict: the forward trajectory of the car and driver, and the line between the driver and the addressee, to the left. Since the driver could not turn to face the addressee, he came up with a different form of waving in this context. The gesture was formed by awkwardly turning the left hand so that the palm faced the addressee on the left (i.e., SHOW) and moving the hand up and down from the waver's own perspective. From his own point of view this was a kind of chopping motion, but from the ad­ dressee's point of view it was a side-to-side waving motion.The direction of the wave was thus dissociated from the direction in which the waver was facing and moving. The gesture makes sense in terms of the SHOW parameter. The palm was turned in the direction of the addressee, and it is this addressee whose locus the palm represents in the northern system as being away. Once facing the right direction, the side-to-side direction of the waving action was determined as appropriate even though it was, from the perspective of the waver himself, the wrong direction. The ges­ ture was a departure from a canonical wave but remained within the sys­ tem of the SHOW parameter and realized it in a novel way. The example

64

Setting the Stage

demonstrates compositionality ofwaving in that the gesture was not acti­ vated as a whole but was constructed out offeatures that proved open to
independent manipulation. Nonetheless, in having compositional structure beckoning and wav­
ing are unique. The system offeatures out ofwhich they are composed is an apparently isolated pocket within a code characterized more appropri­ ately by the earlier list-segmentation, lexicalization, etc., but not com­
positionality.

Restricted Speech-Act Functions
Emblems are complete speech acts in themselves, but the speech acts they perform are restricted to a certain range of functions (Kendon 1981). They regulate and comment on the behavior ofothers, reveal one's own emotional states, make promises, swear oaths, etc. They are used to sa­ lute, command, request, reply to some challenge, insult, threaten, seek protection, express contempt or fear. In contrast to spontaneous ges­ tures, however, they do not represent objects or events. Even when the iconicity of emblems is taken into account, the function is not referential or propositional. The precision grip involved in forming the Ring (the OK sign) is not a comment on the roundness or smallness, delicacy, or manner ofmanipulation ofsome object or situation: it is an expression of approbation, viz., that something is adequate by some standard. Sparhawk (1976) made the same observation for Persian emblems: her examples fell into the categories of questions, impositions, offers, and
comments, not statements of fact or of ideas. Combinations could be construed as propositional in character, but even they were used to ex­ press one's own state, not to describe objects or events (e.g., "cold + sleepy" ). Kendon ( 198 1) reviewed a number of published lists of em­ blems and categorized the speech acts they apparently performed. Over 80% were used for interpersonal control, announcement of one's own current state, or evaluation of another person. In contrast, gestures that were labels for objects or actions were the least frequent of all types,
down to 5 % in some lists. Kendon raises the question of why the social code of emblems is so
restricted. Why are so few referential and propositionalr He suggests a number offactors, among them the suitability ofemblems for collusive and secret messages being exchanged at the same time as speech interac­ tions are taking place. Related to this, gestures can have communicative effects outside ofawareness, a point also demonstrated in the "mismatch" experiments described in chapter 5 . However, these reasons do not uniquely explain why emblems are restricted to the speech acts of

Conventions, Gestures, and Signs

65

social commentary/regulation and self-expression. Propositional con­ tent could be quite inlportant for collusive speech, and such content is conveyed out ofawareness in the mismatch experiments. I believe there is another important factor, the belief in word magic. Spoken words are special and carry with them the responsibility for being articulated. However, conveying the same meaning in gesture form avoids the artic­ ulatory act and, thanks to word magic, this lessened responsibility for speaking transfers to the speech act itself. Thus, the responsibility for commentary, regulation, or self-expression is reduced if you don't actu­ allyspeak it. The pressure to invokegestures and specify them by conven­ tions would therefore be most strongly felt for those speech acts where the cultural sanctions are most severe, and these are the acts of commen­
tary, control, and self-expression. This theory holds that from knowing the areas where a culture places sanctions we can predict the emblems that will be developed and maintained.

Inducing Signs Experimentally
One ofthe most remarkable demonstrations ofthe changes made in ges­ tures organized under a code comes from an experiment carried out by Ralph Bloom ( 1 979) as his undergraduate thesis at the University of Chicago. The importance ofthis study is in how it shows linguistic prop­ erties taking their place in a gesture system. Theymake their appearance almost immediately. Within a remarkably short period of time the sub­ ject's gestures become well organized into what must be regarded as a linguistic system. There is, therefore, no resistance from the gesture me­ dium to taking on language-like properties. From this rapid linguistic buildup with gestures that do not accompany speech, we can be confi­ dent that when gestures do accompany speech and lack linguistic proper­ ties, the lack is an interpretable phenomenon that reveals the existence of a nonlinguistic imagistic mode ofthought.
Bloom had normal, hearing adult subjects recount fairy stories to lis­ teners without any use of speech. The subjects and the listeners were uni­ versity students with no prior knowledge of a sign language. The following description is based on the performance of one subject whom Bloom identified as "Danny," who decided that he would tell the story of Snow White (other subjects chose Hansel and Gretel or Little Red Ridinghood). The listener, another university student, did not know in advance which story Danny would attempt to narrate. The listener was also banned from using speech, and in fact began to make some use ofthe gestural linguistic system. Mter the narrative was over, Bloom then had

66

Setting the Stage

the listener retell the story (in speech) and had Danny review his perfor­ mance and explain his signs (all ofthis was also recorded on videotape).
What occurs in these circumstances is a very rapid introduction oflin­
guistic properties into the gesture channel. Within 1 5 or 20 minutes a system has emerged that includes segmentation, compositionality, a lexi­ con, a syntax with paradigmatic oppositions, arbitrariness, distinctive­
ness, standards of well-formedness, and a high degree of fluency. The subject quickly moved to the right-hand end of Kendon's continuum. Since nothing in Danny's past experience included acquaintance with a
sign language, we can visualize him traversing all the way across it.4 I will first summarize the system that Danny devised, and then comment on its linguistic properties.

Summar)1 ofDanny )s Performance
LEXICON. Danny developed a lexicon ofstable gestures that had recog­ nizable referents in the story and that recurred in the same forms. Each main character had its own sign, and so did attributes of the characters and other entities, as well as the principal actions (in the examples below words in double quotes are specific signs in Danny 's lexicon). For exam­ ple, there was a sign for "King" made in two parts.
"King": first the two hands outlined a crown on the head (each hand points to the head on opposite sides, and then moves up and down while the hands rotate around the head) ; then has-muscles (the hands moved quickly down to the sides and, while sitting very straight, clenched and moved rapidly across the chest).
There was also a sign for "Queen," again made in two parts:
"Queen": first the same crown; then has-breasts (two hands form cups facing upward at the chest).
The sign for "shooting" simulated holding a rifle (although in the story actual shooting was done with a bow and arrow).
The sign for "goodlike" was made by drawing a smiling mouth over Danny's mouth, an opposed sign for "evillike" was made by drawing a

4. Kendon (personal communication) has pointed out that the continuum might be multidimensional. One dimension, clearly, is the extent to which speech is obligatory; an­ other is the extent to which the code is socially shared; others are usages ofdifferent linguis­ tic properties, which may appear at different places on the continuum. These different dimensions, since they are less than perfectly correlated, would be expected to emerge at different places. The continuum also might be better presented as a circle, since gesticula­ tions can accompany the production of signs.

VIEWPOINT. The viewpoints of iconics is discussed in chapter 4. Basi­

viewpoints appear in the gestures people perform during narra­ gesture may seem to reenact the character, and this is character

viewpoint (C-VPT), or the gesture may appear to display an event from

the viewpoint ofan observer, and this is observerviewpoint (0-VPT). In

Danny's narration both viewpoints appeared, with C-VPT outnumber­

ing O-VPT 62% to 3 8 % . Exploiting a tendency also present in spon­

taneous gestures, the viewpoints were used systematically to distinguish

transitive and intransitive actions :

Character viewpoint was strongly connected with transitive situations

(accounting for 80% of C-VPT gestures) in which an actor acted on an

object. An example is "sweeps," where Danny's body represented Snow

White's body and mimed actions ofsweeping the floor.

Observerviewpointwas even more strongly associated with intransitive

situations (accounting for 88% of O-VPT gestures) where an actor

changes location or performs an act that lacks an object. An example here

is "�alks from," where Daru:y's hand represented the hunter's body wallung away from Snow WhIte and Danny himselfwas an onlooker.

PRONOUNS. Pronouns were defined by Bloom as gestures that sub­

stituted for entitynames; thus there had to be an entity name in order for

usually III the shape ofa V, with the palm facing down. The sole function

ofthis gesture was to refer to a person; for example:

points to right + the V-shape ( = the hunter) + "perplexed" for "the

hunter was perplexed."

Body pronouns consisted ofDanny's body or the listener's body with

the sole function ofreferring to a person. An example:

"walks" gesture + points to left i n V-shape ( = the hunter) + "shoots"

+ points to listener ( - Snow White) for "the hunter shoots her."

left space for the King, and the space in front at stomach level for Snow

White. Here is an example :

hold-up in King's space + "joins" + right hand moves + "produce" +

hold-up in Snow White's space + "cradles" for "the King joins the

Queen and produces a baby, Snow White" (the right hand, for the Queen, was brought into the gesture space at the moment the "joins" sign was made).

CASE INCORPORATION IN VERB S . These cases provide information

that depicts an aspect of an action-the actor, the object, location, etc.

The case is built directly into the action gesture, and there need not be a

separate gesture for the case. Some examples (which have no parallel in

Danny's English-language speech) :

"opens" (hand appears to pull on door) made with hunched shoulders

to indicate the actor (one ofthe dwarves).

"shoots" (hands appear to hold a rifle) to indicate the animacy of the

actor.

"looks-at" (two O�shaped hands move toward target) to show the

shape ofthe eyes. "drips" (precision-grip

of a transitive verb was signed Danny first moved his body to

separately in a place where

"Snow he had

amples again illustrate Tuite's (n.d.) suggestion that gestur�s show erga­ tive patterns because they directly incorporate the semantIC arguments

most closely connected to the action. Thus, to convey food Danny per­

formed a gesture for the act ofeating, and this incorporated food within

69

it, but to convey the agent, Danny had to make a separate gesture for Snow White.

WORD ORDER. This tended to be SV and SVO, following English word order, but there were many one-word "sentences."
Linguistic Properties
Some properties in this system were derived from English (such as word order) but many others were unique and exotic from the point ofview of English (lexical incorporation, three kinds of pronoun, association of viewpoint with transitivity, ergativity). Since this entire code emerged in about 20 minutes, we have a telescoped view of the birth and develop­ ment of a fairly complex system that includes several linguistic proper­ ties.

SEGMENTATION AND LEXICON. There were recurrent gestures for the
King and the Queen, Snow White, the Dwarves, and the Hunter-the latter both in an iconic sign (holding a rifle) and in a classifier-like gesture (inverted V) that was incorporated into verb gestures. Moreover, all the gestures fell into recognizable classes of noun-like entity-terms, adjective-like attribute-terms, and verb-like action-terms.

PARADIGMATIC OPPOSITION. The "King" and "Queen" signs were both made with two elements one ofwhich was shared (crown) and the other ofwhich contrasted (has-muscles vs. has-breasts). Thus the two re­
ferring terms were organized into a paradigmatic set that shared one fea­ ture and contrasted on the other. Exemplifying a different method, the good Queen and the evil Queen were made with the same sign, and the opposition between them was made predicatively: e.g., "Queen evillike"
or "Queen #2" both distinguished from "Queen goodlike."

ARBITRARINESS. An iconic gesture for Snow White (female-shaped) was initially used to describe Snow White; in this use it was an attribute­ sign based on iconicity referring to Snow White's being configured in a
certain way. This is apparent in the sign's early uses, such as:
she ( = Snow White) + grows-up + female-shaped ("she, Snow
White, grows up and becomes female-shaped"). In later uses, however, the same sign was usedpurely denotatively, as a proper name, where being female-shaped was not being attributed. For
example, female-shaped + draws-water + tired + sweeps ("Snow White draws water, sweeps, and is tired").

70

Setting the Stage

In this later use, the potential iconicity of the female-shaped sign was disregarded in favor ofpure denotation ofSnow White.

DISTINCTIVENESS. The sign for King acquired an extra kinesic feature (flat-chested) in a context where Danny felt the distinction between the King and Queen was cmcial and believed the listener was likely to mix the
two up (as he explained in the postexperimental interview) . This was an added feature-a downward chop of both hands in front ofthe chest­ purely for the purpose ofdistinguishing one sign from another. It proves conclusively that the signs were organized into contrastive sets for Danny. Another illustration of distinctiveness was that as the Queen sign became more and more schematic with repetition, it never lost distinc­
tiveness with respect to the King sign. At first "Queen" was the elaborate two-step sign described previously with (a) the crown gesture (itself in­ volving several up-and-down movements and a slow rotation around the head) and (b) the has-breasts gesture. With repetition, the crown gesture was reduced to simply a twirl of one hand near the head and the has­ breasts gesture to a backwards flip of one hand (by now facing down) near the chest. The backwards flip, however minimal, distinguished 'the Queen sign from the King sign and was never omitted.

COMPOSITIONALITY. This existed on two levels, morphological and syntactic. Morphologically, "King" and "Queen" were formed out of a combination ofthe crown and has-muscles or has-breasts features. Syn­ tactically, "King," "Queen" and other gestures combined linearly or in­ corporated case features to constmct propositions.

STANDARDS OF WELL-FORMEDNESS. Standards seem to have been consciously applied, as indicated by the following: (a) there was a high degree of streamlining of gestures but distinctiveness was preserved;
(b) the listener adopted some of the same gestures, e.g., the female­ shaped sign for Snow White; (c) Danny's remarks duringthe postexperi­ mental interview which implied that he had conscious standards. For ex­ ample, he could answer questions about the form of the crown gesture and when he would make it with one or two hands.

F LUENCY. This is difficult to demonstrate quantitatively or illustrate in examples, but is very clearupon inspection ofthe video ofthe narrative.
The speed of the gestures picked up enormously, the signs became streamlined by cutting them down to their essential features, and the lis­ tener began to learn the system well enough to formulate questions in it.

Conventions, Gestures, and Signs

71

Summary of the Experiment
It is undeniable that Danny's gestures developed many linguistic proper­ ties. This itselfis proofthat gesture is capable ofshowing the qualities of a language and that, when it does, it changes from global-synthetic: it becomes standardized, lexicalized, decomposable, combinable, used in arbitrary extensions, streamlined for efficient performance, and so forth. Language properties emerged simply by forcing the subject to pay atten­ tion to the gesture channel. This is perhaps the most surprising aspect of Bloom's results: how quickly and with what little guidance language properties come into play.

Sources of Change
What is the source ofthe language-like properties that appear in the ges­ ture channel? The channel itselfcannot explain them. While the medium is the s:une, language-like and non-language-like gestures are widely dif­ ferent In numerous respects. Transfers from speech also do not explain them, at least not all of them. The deaf children of hearing parents have no spoken language source. While transfers from spoken Warlpiri to the WSL system definitely can be shown to have taken place, and ASL may have been influenced historically by the English-language speech of the wider co�unity, the gesture performance of Danny showed many language-like features that have no counterparts in English, the only pos­ sible source in his case. Thus, the gesture medium is capable of incor­ porating language-like features, but these emerge, somehow, seemingly on their own. These spontaneous language�like features are ofthe great­ est interest. They seem to have been produced out of the necessity of using gestures in a communicative system. Their changes from spon­ taneous gestures may refl,ect the constraints on symbols when the sym­ bols are the focus ofcommunicative intentions.
This kind of shift in the form of representation when the represen­ tation becomes self-contained has been studied by Karmiloff-Smith ( 1979b) who wrote as follows regarding the spontaneous notation sys­ tems of children; her remarks seem equally relevant to the emergence of linguistic properties in gestures :
The stepping up to a metaprocedural level seems to occur each time the child has a handle on his currently functioning, goal-oriented system. This enables the child to treat the system, or procedures which are part thereof, as units of func­ tioning in their own right. Thus there appears to be a deep-rooted psychological tendency for a representational tool which functions well procedurally to become subsequently a problem space per se. (P. 91)

72

Setting the Stage

This shift of attitude alters the relationship between the speaker and gesture. Innovations appear that make sense ifgestures are no longer un­ witting expressions ofmeaning but are units offunctioning oftheir own, which are compared to one another and organized into a system de­ signed for ready access and good memory. Linguistic properties imply a meta-level awareness ofgestures as signs. A lexicon requires recognizing that form-meaning pairings repeat themselves. Arbitrariness depends on extending a form into contexts where the referent is preserved but the original form-meaning pairing is lost. Compositionality is a product of
segmentation and arises when the speaker realizes that meaning com­ plexes that have been broken into segments must be reconstituted. Bloom's subject did this spontaneously once he invented his gesture
words for the King and Queen. Standards ofform summarize and codify as intuitive restrictions the speaker's solutions in the problem space men­
tioned by Karmiloff-Smith, and are the linguistic property that most
dearly reflects a meta-level awareness. Paradigmatic oppositions reveal an attitude ofdifferentiation toward the gestures as units in which sets of minimally contrasting units are set up. Distinctiveness implies a system in which the speaker realizes that gestures are similar to one another in ab­
sentia, and adds form details solely to keep gestures apartwithinthis sys­ tem.
The idea is thus that a meta-level ofawareness ofgestures in their own
right releases the "resilient properties" of linguistic systems, properties that appear even when input is lackingor is degenerate (Goldin-Mcadow 1982). Long ago Condillac ( [ 1 756] 1971 ; see Harris and Taylor 1 989) regarded gestures as human language precursors thatwere supplanted by words and sentences to aid making one's own thoughts intelligible to others (what Harris and Taylor refer to as "telementation"). The linear and segmented character oflanguage was necessary, in Condillac�s view, for the full development of human consciousness and must have arisen from the preceding experience of people without a language. In the re­ lease of resilient properties by meta-level attention to gesture we may see-over a very short period oftime-a partial replay ofwhat Condillac regarded as linguistic evolution.
Such then is the state of gestures at the rightward end of Kendon's continuum, where gestures are focused upon as the sole means of com­ munication. The rest of this book is concerned with the contrasting "gesticulation" end of the continuum, where gestures are the unwitting accompaniments of speech. Here, utilizing a channel of which the speaker is largely unaware, we can use gestures to see into his thoughts.

Introduction
With this chapter I begin my description ofthe varieties of gestures. In the course ofPart 2, I will discuss the different kinds ofgestures and the coding scheme that we have used to transcribe and analyze them. I will present information on the contexts in which they appear and on how they relate to semantic meaning and pragmatic function. I will also pre­ sent statistics oftheir distribution.
This particular chapter describes the coding scheme, our methods for collecting and coding gestures, and the basic statistics ofgesture occur­ rence. It also reproduces the transcript of a full narrative by an adult speaker, including all ofthe gestures. Chapter 4 is devoted to the variety of gestures of the concrete (iconics of different degrees of elaboration). Chapter 5 presents an experiment on gestures and how they effect lis­ teners to narratives. Chapter 6 explains the gestures ofthe abstract (meta­ phorics, beats, abstract pointing). The four chapters together form a kind ofencyclopedia ofthe gestures and their effects at the gesticulation end of Kendon's continuum.
Types of Gesture
Classification Schemes
A number of gesture classification schemes have been proposed over the years. I will mention three in addition to our own. All four are sum­ marized in table 3 . 1 . The justification for our own scheme is that it does not require overly fine distinctions and that it is gauged to identify the types ofgesture that appear in narratives. All ofthe schemes are basically the same, a fact explained by their common descent from Efron's ( 1 94 1 ) classification. Efron ( 1941 ) and Ekman and Friesen ( 1969) subdivide gestures more finely than we have; Freedman and Hoffman ( 1967) have built in a somewhat different orientation-toward the gestures that take place during psychotherapy sessions rather than during storytelling. While each scheme has its own special usefulness, they are interconvert­ ible in the sense that they regard the same movements as gestures and differ only in their grouping and subdividing strategies.

could, ifhe wished, employ all three schemes or start with one and switch to another and cover the same gestural movements.
In our approach we classify gesture movements into four major categories: iconic, metaphoric, deictic (pointing), and beat �estu�es ; def­ initions are provided later in the chapter. The gesture classifications we have used have validity inasmuch as the four types are not uniformly di­ vided among discourse functions, but some are strongly associated with metanarrative functions, other with narrative, and so forth. All of this is shown in table 3.7 and explained in detail in chapter 7. Also, the four categories have different histories ofdevelopment in children (chap. 1 1 ) and different breakdown patterns in aphasia (chap. 12).
The scheme was have used has the goal ofidentifying the referential values of gestures. The orientation of the scheme is toward the entities, actions, spaces, concepts, relationships, etc., that the gestures refer to. The classification scheme thus requires asking what meanings and functions a gesture possesses. It provides a guided, systematic, and disci­ plined method for inferring these meanings and functions. (It thus differs from schemes that make physical form differences into the primary basis of categorization. ) The gesture categories, iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and beat, distinguish references to concrete events, to abstract concepts and relations, to orientations and reorientations, and to discontinuities: these are the goals ofthe scheme. The classification also makes essential linkage to the accompanying speech. A gesture category is formulated only in coordination with the speech content. An iconic gesture, for ex-

ample, is one that, in its execution and manner ofperformance, refers to a concrete event, object, or action that is also referred to in speech at the same time. The iconic category expresses directly a category ofmeaning that must be compared to speech, and the other gesture categories are meant to have their own linkages to speech functions as well.
Our purpose is thus to bring out semiotic values, and this has led us to
build semiotic distinctions directly into the gesture classification; that is, to classify the gesture by means ofasking (a) is the movement a symbol? and (b) what type ofsymbol is it? The categories oficonic, metaphoric, deictic, or beat correspond to the fundamental types of semiotic sign
(Peirce 1931-58). One category requires a bit ofexplanation. This is the "Butterworth,"
corresponding to the "speech failure" category in Freedman and
Hoffman's scheme (neither Efron nor Ekman and Friesen included such a category). I have named this category after Brian Butterworth, a
scholar in Britain who has argued that many gestures arise in response to speech failures (see, e.g., Butterworth and Beattie 1978; Butterworth and Hadar 1989). I do not agree with this view that speech failures are a necessary or even an important condition for gesture occurrence in a general sense, but I would not deny that there are gestures that occur specifically as part ofan effort to recall a word and/or find an appropriate sentence structure. However, they are a small fraction of all gestures, at least in narratives. A prototypical instance of a Butterworth is a hand grasping or plucking in the airwhile the speaker is trying to recall a word. Typically, there is no speech and this not-speakingplaces the Butterworth away from the leftward, gesticulation, end ofKendon's continuum (see
chap. 2).

Experimental Paradigm
Basic Situation
Most of our gesture examples have been recorded during narrative dis­ course. Some other examples are taken from video recorded conversa­ tions, anthropological films, TV broadcasts, and naturally observed academic discourse. The narrative situation is quasi-experimental in that a speaker is shown a "stimulus"-a film, animated cartoon, or comic book-and then after this exposure the speaker immediately recounts the story ofthe stimulus from memory to a listener, andwe videotape the performance. The listener is a genuine listener who does not have prior knowledge ofthe stimulus and does not see it. The speaker is told to pre­ sent the story in as clear and complete a fashion as possible, for the lis-

tener will have to retell it later to a third person. Neither the speaker nor the listener knows that gestures are ofinterest andthe instructions do not even mention the word. The speakers have been adults and children, and a number have been speakers of non-English languages (German, French, Italian, Georgian, Swahili, Chinese, and Japanese-the last four non-Indo-European). In addition, we have tested both Broca-type and Wernicke-type aphasics and two commissurotomy patients (so-called split-brains; see chap. 12). A major methodological advantage of this procedure is that, since we know the source of the narration indepen­ dently ofthe narration itself, comparisons among speakers narrating the same episodes are possible. A detailed description ofthe methodsused in this research will be found in the Appendix.

the details.

DEFINITIONS. All visible movements by the speaker are first differenti­ ated into gestures and non-gestures; the latter comprise self-touching (e.g., stroking the hair) and object-manipulations. The rest are con­ sidered gestures and are classified as to type. Gestures are distinguished basically as imagistic and non-imagistic types, depending on whether they depict imagery. In addition, the imagistic types are often triphasic (preparation-stroke-retraction), while the non-imagistic type, the beat, is biphasic.
A gesture is iconic ifit bears a close formal relationship to the semantic content of speech. As noted previously, an iconic gesture displays, in its form and manner ofexecution, aspects ofthe same scene that speech also presents (McNeill and Levy 1982). An example is a gesture that accom­ panied the utterance, "he tries going up inside the pipe this time," in which the hand rises upward: this depicts, in its manner of execution, a feature also referred to in speech, namely, upward motion. The gesture omits other features (interiority, the identity ofthe character, etc.) but is classified as iconic because ofthe upward trajectory. Another iconic ges­ ture is the"bends itwayback" example (ex. 1. 1). As the speaker described this scene he appeared to grip something in his own hand and pull it back toward his shoulder. The grip shape ofthe hand andthe backward trajec­ tory displayed aspects ofthe scene that speech also was presenting ("and he bent it way back"). Thus the gesture is classified as iconic:

While the semiotic definitionoficonic gestures refers to thecontentof

the gesture, itis possible to identifyiconic gestures without anyreference

to the accompanying speech. Gestures have been coded as beat or iconic

based solely on formal movement characteristics. This method has been

crucial for coding the gestures of aphasic speakers for whom we cannot

assume that speech presents meaning in a normal manner (Pedelty

1987). Because we have repeatedly used the same narrative stimuli we

have been able to examine the gestures ofmany normal speakers narrat-

80

Varieties of Gesture

ing these stories, and to derive "canonical" gesture forms used to depict certain scenes. Gestures of special populations of subjects (such as apha­ sics) can then be classified with high reliability by comparing their move­ ment features with the movement features ofthe canonical gestures.
Metaphoric gestures are similar to iconics in that they present imagery, but present an image ofan abstract concept, such as knowledge, language
itself, the genre of the narrative, etc. Metaphorics are, therefore, intrin­ sically more complex than iconics. Whereas an iconic gesture depicts some concrete event or object by creating a homology to aspects ofthe event/object, a metaphoric must depict two things. There is the Base (this term is from Mandel 1977), which is the concrete entity or action that is actually presented in the gesture. An example is a gesture present­
ing the concept of a question as a cupped hand: the Base is this cup, ico­ nically depicted in the gesture. There is also the Referent (Mandel 1977), which is the concept that the metaphoric gesture Base is presenting: the
concept of a question or of the answer (in either case, an abstract con­ cept).Thus, a cupped hand accompanying the question, "I wanted to ask you something," presents a Base (the cup) and the Referent (the con­ cept). The coding of metaphorics takes this dual structure into account.
Deictic gestures are pointing movements, which are prototypically performed with the pointing finger, although any extensible object or body part can be used, including the head, nose, or chin, as well as ma­ nipulated artifacts. The deictic gestures that appear during narratives rarely if ever point to concrete entities. They select a part of the gesture space and the meaning of the gesture depends on the referential value attached to this region.
Beats are defined as movements that do not present a discernible meaning, and they can be recognized positively in terms of their pro­
totypical movement characteristics. They are typically biphasic (two movement components), small, low energy, rapid flicks ofthe fingers or hand; they lack a special gesture space, and are performed indeed wher­
ever the hands happen to find themselves, including rest positions (the lap, next to the cheek, etc. ). Some ofthe positive movement properties of beats have been organized into a "beat filter," which I describe below.

CODING METHODS. The coding of gestures is hierarchical in the sense that some coding categories are introduced only for gestures ofthe imag­
istic type (iconics, metaphorics). The Appendix presents the coding
scheme in detail, along with example transcriptions. Coding proceeds by answering a series ofquestions. For those gestures considered to be ico­ nic or metaphoric, each is coded in terms of

A score of 0 means no imagery on formal grounds, and the gesture probably is a beat. A score of 5 or 6 means high imagery on formal grounds, and the gesture is probably iconic or metaphoric (which it is depends on the relationship to meaning).
In addition, meaning judgments can be rated on a confidence scale with 1 =marginally convinced and 5 =totally certain.

Kinesic Structure

Gesture Form Kendon ( 1972, 1980) wrote of the hierarchy ofgesture movements that it "may be seen to provide at least a partial diagram of the relations be­ tween the units ofthe spealcer's discourse" (207) ; we have found ample reason to agree with this statement. The following diagram summarizes the hierarchy (from McNeill, Levy, and Pedelty 1990).

ARM USE AND B O DY POSTURE. Within units on this level, the speaker adopts different body postures and arm usage patterns. Kendon observed stretches in which all gestures were made with the right arm or left arm, or both. Shifting between arm options and body postures defines a ki­ nesic unit on this level. The discourse stretches marked by consistent arm
usage and body postures correspond roughly to a "paragraph" (Kendon 1972).

HEAD MOVEMENTS. Within stretches ofa consistent arm and body use shorter sketches occur in which the same head movements take place; for

example, first the head moves from the center ofthe gesture space to the right, and this occurs several times.

GESTURE-UNIT ( G-UNIT) . The G-unit is defined as the period of time between successive rests of the limbs; a G-unit begins the moment the limb begins to move and ends when it has reached a rest position again.

GESTURE-PHRASE ( G-PHRASE) . The G-phrase occurs within a G-unit (several G-phrases may cluster together within one G-unit).
A G-phrase in turn consists ofone or moremovementphases (prepara­ tion' various holds, stroke, retraction) :
1 . Preparation (optional), in which the limb moves away from its rest position to a position in gesture spacewhere the stroke begins. The prep­ aration phase typically anticipates the linguistic segments that are coex­ pressive with the gesture's meaning.
Ih. Pre-stroke hold (optional) is the position and hand posture reached at the end of the preparation itself; this may be held more or less briefly until the stroke begins (cf. chap. 10; the terms "pre-stroke" and "post­ stroke hold" are from Kita 1 990). Pre-stroke holds occur when, for some reason, the stroke onset is delayed (chap. 10).
A hold in general is any temporary cessation of movement without leaving the gesture hierarchy (in contrast to a rest, which means exiting the hierarchy).
2. Stroke (obligatory) isthepeakofeffortinthegesture. Itis inthisphase that the meaning of the gesture is expressed. The stroke is synchronized with the linguistic segments that are coexpressive with it. It typically is performed in the central gesture space bounded roughly by the waist, shoulders, and arms; the head also becomes involved occasionally.
2h. Post-stroke hold (optional) is the final position and posture of the hand reached at the end ofthe stroke; this may be held more or less briefly until the retraction begins. Post-stroke holds occur when, for some rea­ son, the coexpressive spoken utterance is delayed (chap. 1 0).
3 . Retraaion (optional) is the return ofthe hand to a rest position (not necessarily the one occupied before the G-phrase).
While a G-phrase cannot existwithout a stroke, bydefinition, the other phases are optional. However, the optionto omitthepreparationphase is rarelytaken in our narratives. Virtually all gestures contain a preparation component, and one may be added, apparently superfluously. Retraction phases are often omitted when one gesture passes directly into a succeed­ ing gesture. The preparation and the two stroke-hold phases can compen­ sate for mismatches ofspeech-gesture synchrony.

Varieties of Gesulre

To illustrate these phases I will use the following examples from Kendon ( 1 980) :

1 . The hand rises up and takes an umbrella form, and then moves down
sharply. Preparation: hand rising up and taking umbrella form. Stroke: hand moving down sharply. Post-stroke hold: hand held in position reached at end ofstroke. Retraction : fingers relax into loose bunch.
2. The arm rises up and sweeps side-to-side two times. Preparation : arm rises upward. Stroke: arm swings in and out twice. Note that this is considered to be one stroke even though the arm moves in and out two times. Retraction: arm returns to the rest position it was in before the ges­ ture.
In this book most of our observations refer to the lowest level of the kinesic hierarchy, and within this level, to the stroke phase. (The strokes in the examples appear within square brackets except when the example also shows the preparation and retraction phases; in this case the brackets mark the beginning and end of the entire gesture and the stroke is in boldface.) The stroke is the phase that carries the gesture content. The preparation phase is crucial for the question of gesture timing. I dis­ cussed this earlier, in chapter 1 ; experiments on timing are described in chapter 10.

GESTURES AND SPEECH PHONOLOGY. In an analysis of the relation­ ship ofgesture movements to speech sounds, Kendon ( 1972) compared the kinesic hierarchy above to the tone units comprising a natural conver­
sation. He could define a phonological hierarchy (Kingdon 1958) and observed that the two hierarchies-sound and gesture-were remarka­ bly parallel to one another. On the lowest phonological level is the most prominent syllable) the phonological peak within a single clause. Just
above this is the tone unit) a grouping of syllables over which there is a complete intonation tune (e.g., rise-fall, etc.). Tone units in turn form locutions) mapping typically onto complete sentences. A locution is sepa­ rated from its neighbors by distinct pauses and begins with increased
loudness. A series oflocutions forms a locutiongroup. At this level there may be phonological variation but some common phonological feature will be preserved throughout, such as the same, e.g., low-rise, tune. The highest level is the locution cluster, which is marked by pauses, repeated or repaired phrases, altered pitch and/or voice quality, and a thematic shift of content.

The phonological and kinesic hierarchies line up such that boundaries between the highest, middle, and lowest levels ofeach hierarchy co-occur in time (table 3.2, based on Kendon 1972, 1980). It appears from table 3 . 2 that each speech unit has it� equivalent unit ofbody motion, and the larger the speech unit, the greater the change in the kinesic sphere, per­ haps as a form ofworking memory control (Kendon 1 972).
LENGTH OF G-UNITS. Given that G-units can encompass more than one G-phrase, or gesture, how long in fact do G-units tend to be? Table 3 . 3 answers this question for six cartoon narratives, and shows the percent­ age ofG-units that contain one, two, three, etc., G-phrases. Abouthalfof all G-units consist of a single gesture, a few oftwo successive gestures, and the rest ofa range oflonger sequences.
Table 3.4 gives the converse distribution, the empty spans between G-units. These were stretches of speech where there were no gestures; the length of a span is indexed in terms of clauses. Most G-units had no clauses between them. This means that 70% of the time the hands re­ turned to rest between successive clauses and then immediately returned to action to make a new gesture. Ofthe remaining spans, two-thirds con­ tained just one clause. Thus, while gesture activity is fairly continuous, there are almost as many rests as there are gestures.
From tables 3 . 3 and 3.4 we learn that most gestures occur one gesture at a time. Gestures tend to occur as singletons and between gestures the hands return to a rest position. (Along with the obligatory presence of speech, this predominance ofsingletons also differentiates gestures from pantomime. )

GESTURE HAND SHAPES. Table 3 . 5 summarizes the hand shapes that have appeared as iconic gestures in the six cartoon narratives. The ASL shapes in the table are only approximated by spontaneous gestures; we describe the gesture with the ASL shape that the gesture most closely resembles, but nearly all gestures are deficient from an ASL point ofview (too loose, not clearly enough marked). Narratives in other genres (such as films) would undoubtedly produce a different distribution of shapes, but the most common hand shapes are likely to occur in all narratives. Indeed, themost frequent ofall is the 5-hand, which is the ASL approx­ imation to a relaxed, semantically unmarked hand in the loose way it is made. The bent 5-hand, in contrast, is semantically motivated: it can be used to depict removing a hat from a character's head, for example. Over the six narratives twenty different shapes were used. Different speakers had individual favorites : for example, speaker 1 preferred the G-hand; speaker 3 the O-hand; speaker 4 the C-hand; speaker 6 the S-hand; and so forth. Most shapes, whether the favorite ofone speaker or ofall, corre­ spond to semantic distinctions, and these are described in chapter 4.
Gesture Space
The gesture space can be visualized as a shallow disk in front of the speaker, the bottom half flattened when the speaker is seated (see fig. 3 . 1). Adults usually perform gestures within this limited space (with chil­ dren the space is larger; see chap. 1 1). Figure 3.2 shows the density of gesture occurrence in this space (all six speakers combined). The fore-aft dimension is shorted and almost never extends behind the body; gestures behind the frontal plane of the body are rare and have marked status. Speakers from different cultures appear to organize their gesture spaces somewhat differently. Turkana speakers, for example, make more use of the space around the head than speakers of European languages (see chap. 6). The latter, in turn, do not noticeably differ from one another
(this includes observations ofspeakers ofEnglish, French, German, Ital­ ian, and Georgian).
For transcription purposes, the gesture space can be divided into sec­ tors using a system of concentric squares; the sector directly in front of the chest is Center-Center; surrounding this is the Center, then the Pe-

The panels in fig. 3.2 are filled in different regions depending on the type of gesture. !conics fill the Center-Center space. Metaphorics con­ gregate below in the lower Center space. Deictics extend to the Periph­ ery. Beats form bunches at several places and each bunch is due to a different speaker. That the four types ofgesture utilize space in such dif­ ferent ways is, in itself, a strong justification for subdividing gestures ac­ cording to the iconic, metaphoric, deictic, and beat scheme.

Statistics
The following statistics of gesture occurrence are based on the six car­ toon narratives mentioned earlier by young adult English-language speakers (university students). Such statistics provide a general orienta­ tion to the incidence of gestures and their distribution in relation to speech during narrative discourse.
CO-OCCURRENCE O F GESTURE WITH SPEECH. In many hours of re­ corded narratives, we have observed only one instance of a gesture by a listener. The passive comprehender role does not evoke gestures to any­ thing like the same degree as the active producer role. The cause of this huge difference is unclear. The listener is experiencing the same content and linguistic forms and presumably is constructing imagistic represen­ tations of the narrative in parallel with the speaker; yet there are no ges­ tures. It is possible that gestural production is suppressed along with speech as part of the turn-taking conventions regulating face-to-face in­ teractions, where a sharp distinction obtains between the speaker and the listener (Duncan and Fiske 1 977). It is alsopossiblethat gesture produc­ tion requires motor activity in the speech channel. Whatever the explana-

tion, the production ofgestures and speaking are virtually restricted to the same situations.
Focusing, then, on the speaker we find that the majority ofhis or her gestures occur during actual speech articulation. Gestures during hesi­ tant periods (pauses, silent or filled) are in a distinct minority. Table 3.6 shows the distribution of gestures in five categories: co-articulated speech, filled pauses ("urn," "uh," and extended phonation of the vowel portions ofwords), unfilled pauses, breath pauses (i.e., audible breathi­ ness during an unfilled pause), and false starts (the speaker interrupts his or her utterance and immediately begins a repair). The decisive compo­ nent ofthe gesture in table 3.6 is the stroke phase. Ifthe stroke coincided with speech, the gesture was counted as coinciding with speech even if there was silence during the preparation or retraction phase; conversely, ifthe stroke coincided with silence, the gesture was counted as coinciding with silence even ifthere was speech during the preparation or retraction
phases. With beats (which have only two phases), the entire gesture had to coincide with speech to be counted as occurring during speech. Table 3.6 shows that 90% ofall strokes occurred duringthe actual articulation
ofspeech. Slightly less than 4% took place during false starts and slightly more than 3% during breath pauses; only between 1 % and 2% occurred during filled and unfilled pauses respectively.
This result superficially contrasts with that ofButterworth and Beattie ( 1978), who found nearly identical rates ofgestures per 1000 seconds of speech and 1000 seconds ofhesitation. However, theirwayofpresenting data is not directly comparable to that in table 3.6, which shows the per­ centage ofgestures made during speech and hesitation, not rates per unit of time. To normalize during hesitations and speech to get equal base­ lines of time might be useful for some purposes but it gives a grossly dis­ torted picture of the actual distribution of gestures during narrations since speech is, by far, more copious than hesitation.

FREQUENCY OF GESTURE TYPES. Table 3 . 7 is an expanded version of a table in McNeill and Levy ( 1982). It shows the relative frequency ofico­ nics, beats, metaphorics, and deictics, as well as the frequency of clauses with no gestures accompanying them at all.

The type of clause in table 3 . 7 will be explained briefly; more details are given in chapter 7; also McNeill and Levy (1982). A narrative level clause presents a step in the plot-line development ofthe story; it is there­ fore subject to sequential constraints (Labov and Waletsky 1967; Hop­ per 1979; Hopper and Thompson 1980). An extranarrative clause is any other clause in the storytelling act that is not on the plot line (e.g., de­ scribing the setting, summing up the action, introducing characters, forecasting what is to come, mentioning the video, etc.) and is not sub­
ject to sequential constraints. Extranarrative clauses will eventually be differentiated into subvarieties (metanarrative and paranarrative), but this distinction is not crucial in this chapter and will be overlooked (see chap. 7). More than halfofthe clauses in narratives were accompanied by gestures, and narrative and extranarrative clauses did not differ in the fre­ quency ofgestures that occurred with them.
One generalization that fits table 3 . 7 is this: although there are similar numbers oficonics and beats, iconics occur overwhelmingly in narrative clauses, while beats can occur in both narrative and extranarrative clauses. Thus, iconic gestures are limited by the sequentiality constraint, but beats can appear anywhere. The difference in distribution reflects the different functions of the two kinds of gesture. The events that iconics
illustrate inherently progress in temporal and causal sequences in the real or fictive world, while beats occur at points ofsignificant discontinuity in discourse and function to highlight atemporal relationships (Silverstein 1984). Another generalization we can make is the following: abstract pointing occurs chiefly with narrative clauses, whereas metaphorics ap­ pear chiefly with extranarrative clauses.
Thus, while each type ofgesture has its own way of correlating with narrative and extranarrative contexts, the gestures fall into two larger groups :

1 . Sequence related iconics and deictics appear in narrative contexts. 2. Structure related beats and metaphorics appear in extranarrative con­
texts. Ofthese structure related gestures, beats appear in all contexts, while metaphorics appear primarily in extranarrative contexts.

GESTURE TO CLAUSE CORRESPONDENCE. As a general rule there is one gesture, one clause. Narrators, nonetheless, depart from this rule and de­ part in both directions. Some clauses have more than one gesture and
some gestures cover more than one clause. Table 3.8 (based on a similar table for aphasic speakers in Pedelty 1987, which appears later as table 12.2) tallies the correspondence ofgestures and clauses in the six cartoon narrations.
As can be seen, most departures from a one-to-one ratio are in the multiple gesture to one clause direction. Ifwe equate gestures with "idea units" (Kendon 1980), we can say that the speaker is attempting to cover more than one idea unit with a single clause. Not surprisingly, given the overloading of the linguistic program this implies, multiple gesture to single clause utterances are often accompanied by dysfluencies. For ex­ ample, one speaker performed two distinct gestures during the follow­ ing: "[and she . . . ] [grabbed a knife] ." A lengthy pause interrupted the speech flow before the gesture boundary, as if the speaker were waiting for the next gesture. The multiple clause for one gesture combinations are, by comparison, rare, but they occur frequently in the gestures of Wernicke's aphasics (chap. 12).

Example of a Narration by an Adult Speaker
To provide an extended example ofadultnarrative performance, I repro­ duce in full one speaker's narration of the cartoon story. The narration will illustrate the full range of gestural phenomena, including the inevi­ table residue of gestures that are difficult to classify. Such difficulties are pointed out in the comments. The narrative is typical ofan adult perfor­ mance in most respects. It lasted slightly more than four and a halfmin­ utes. The speaker has a high proportion of iconics relative to other gesture types, and in this respect goes farther than other adults. Her beats almostneverappear in isolation butare superimposed on other ges­ tures, and her deictics are usually combined with iconics; in these re­ spects she also differs somewhat from other adults, but the differences are of proportion, not of kind. In common with other narrators she pro-

duces no emblems. She also has no Butterworths, although her speech has many hesitant phases, and the hesitations are characterized by an ab­ sence of gesture of every kind (cf. Butterworth and Beattie 1978, who seemingly observed the opposite). Also, as is common in narratives, the listener is not entirely passive, but asks questions and reacts to the speaker 'S narrative, to which the speaker in turn responds. Worth noting in particular is the variety of semantic relationships and shifts of view­ point conveyed in the iconic and metaphoric gestures, and the variety of pragmatic references conveyed in the metaphoric beats, and deictics. I have indicated the gesture strokes with brackets but not the other gesture phases (thus the boldface convention for indicating the stroke is not used). All hesitations and false starts are shown, as well as their durations in tenths of a second. The transcript is the work ofmany individuals.

The difficulty in interpreting this gesture as metaphoric is that the opening ofthe right hand, the gripping hand, could be a C-VPT ico­ nic for the cat letting the bird go. The right hand in fact did open slightly before the left. It is also possible that there are two gestures,

The metaphoric gestures in (92) and (93), plus the iconic in (91) for

opening up the cage, are basically the same; the movements are simi-

1ar and all were performed with both hands. The repeateduse ofthe

same type of gesture may have influenced the way the speaker struc­

tured (94) and (95). That is, gesture mayhave affected speech. Once

the two-handed gesture appeared, the speaker keptusing it and had

to find a semantic thread that supported it. The metaphoric gestures

provided the thread but imposed their own effects of shifting the

perspective to a metanarrative level. The first metaphor conveys that

something was a revelation, the beat highlights a contrasting refer­

ent, and the last metaphor comments on something as a predictable

conclusion-comments on the narrative as a structure from the out­

side. The iconic gesture in (91) for opening up the cage thus may

have induced the metanarrative conclusion in (94-95).

Gestures ofthe Concrete

In this chapter and in chapter 6 I will present details about the varieties of gesture: what theylook like, how they function, and in general how they are able to express our thoughts. My aim in these two chapters is to dem­ onstrate with numerous examples that gestures and speech are truly inte­ gral parts of a single process, with the gesture manifesting the imagery that is inherent in this process at an early stage. (Chapter 5 describes an experiment testing the communicative effects of gestures on listeners. ) The present chapter i s devoted to gestures that depict concrete objects and events. These are the gestures ofthe concrete, the ones that we call iconic. Chapter 6 concentrates on gestures of the abstract. By studying gestures ofboth the concrete and abstract kinds, we can see how speakers represent objects and events in actual and fictive worlds. We will see that speakers reveal in their gestures what they regard as relevant and salient in the context-the "psychological predicate" ofwhichVygotsky (1962) wrote. At the same time speech may be unable to express fully the shad­ ing of relevance and salience that is shown in the gesture, since speech (but not gesture) is constrained by standards oflinguistic form, and these standards add their own limits to the speech channel. The first point to establish is that, in performing gestures, the speaker's hands are no longer just hands, but symbols.
Gestures Are Symbols
Gestures are not just movements and can never be fully explained in purely kinesic terms. They are not just the arms waving in the air, but symbols that exhibitmeanings in their own right. They have a meaning that is freely designated by the speaker. The hand can represent a character's hand, the character as a whole, a ball, a streetcar, or anything else; the space likewise can be freely designated-a table top, a street, the side ofa building, midair. In other words, the gesture is capable ofexpressing the full range ofmeanings that arise from the speaker. Gestures are symbols different from spoken language, however. They are created-in contrast to retrieved-by the speaker at the moment of speaking. They coexist with the words and sentences of speech but are qualitatively different from those words and sentences. They are a separate symbolic vehicle with their own history, and finding their own outlet in space, movement, and form. This coexistence of different qualities of symbols-both idio-
105

106

Varieties of Gesture

syncratic and standard-is the fundamentalaspect ofgestures and speech emerging at the same time from a common core process ofmeaning pre­ sentation.
That gestures are symbols is convincingly demonstrated by compar­ ing the gestures produced by different people when they are describing the same event. The descriptions can be compared because of our method of presenting the same narrative stimulus to all subjects. In the following, five speakers are describing a scene from a cartoon in which one character tries to reach a second character by climbing up the inside ofa drainpipe (the sixth speaker did not produce a gesture for this event). The drainpipe conveniently stops at the window ledge where the second character is perched ever so provocatively. The hands are symbols in that they represent something other than themselves: a character rising up­ ward and other specific details, depending on whatever an individual speaker chooses to highlight in the episode. The individually different gesture forms have a common core ofmeaning, not because ofa code or gesture language, but because each speaker separately created her own manual symbol ofthe event. For each symbol refers to the basic event of upward motion, and yet is unconstrained by standards of well­ formedness ofthe type that hold in linguistic systems.

Speaker 1 (see fig. 4. 1 ) :

Figure 4. 1. Speaker 1's iconic ges­ ture with "he tries going [up the inside] ofthe drainpipe." Sylvester is depicted as an undifferentiated blob rising upward. The extended index finger may be an attempt to convey the interiority ofthe path or simply indicate the destination. The blob hand is not without meaning but highlights no aspect of Sylves­ ter's person (no limbs, etc.).

Although a quantitative comparison of the gestures and speech is not realistic, there seems to be about as much variation among the linguistic choices in these examples as among the gestures. The words referring to the drainpipe include, for example, "drainpipe," "pipe," "drainspout," "rain gutter," and "rain barrel." This variation is not obviously less than the manner of moving the hands upward, pointing or not pointing, in a basket shape, rotating, or with a backward flexion. Each speaker high­ lights her own aspects of the situation (this explains much of the varia-

Gestures ofthe Concrete

109

tion) but all retain the core meaning ofthe character rising upward. Here we have five people, five memories of the same event, and five gestural­ verbal descriptions ofthe event that convergeprecisely because the hands are performing as symbols. Thus there coexist two linked symbol sys­ tems: speech and gesture, products ofa single integrated process.

Interpretation of Iconic Gestures
Mind reading
By the title of this section I do not mean anything occult: I mean real mind reading. I mean noticing the gestures with which speakers unwit­ tingly reveal aspects of their inner mental processes and points of view toward events when these are not articulated in speech. In gestures we arc able to see the imagistic form of the speaker's sentences. This imagistic form is not usually meant for public view, and the speaker him- or herself may be unaware ofit or think that it has been well hidden; but it is visible to those who would look at the gestures.
ICONICS IN A TV DOCUMENTARY. Here is an example ofmind reading in which a concrete gesture is the key. I observed this during a BBe film about the Kayapo, a tribe ofIndians oftheAmazonwho have lately come under severe ecological threat. At the time ofthe film (about 1970) they were still living in their traditional manner. The anthropologist, Terence Turner, was describing the Kayapo mode oflife and said, regardinglife in the village, that the women don't have a collective focus to their lives. At the same time, he made a gesture in which his hand moved toward his own body. Then he said that the men dominate the political life of the village, and made a gesture in which his hands moved away from his body. These were clearly not self-referring gestures, despite the use ofthe speaker's own body as a reference point, since they reversed gender roles. The gestures were in fact geographical. They suggest that the speaker was, in his mind, standing at the outer circle ofhouses in a typical Kayapo village and looking in at the center. Kayapo villages have a circular plan and the houses around the periphery are the exclusive property of the women (see fig. 4.6). At the center is the men's hut, open only to men, which is, in fact, the center of the village political life. Economic power and political power thus are separated and this separation is modeled by the Kayapo themselves in the layout ofthe village. We get a glimpse into the anthropologist's mind as he spoke. We see a picture ofthe village with the anthropologist visualizing himself at the outer edge looking in. This

picture was present even though he was talking about the political lif� of the village. He was thinking in terms of the Kayapo's own geographICal metaphor and included himself in it. This image could have been the primitive form of the sentences whose final forms were about abstract ideas such as "collective focus" and "political life."

ICONICS IN THE UP-THE-PIPE SCENE. We canperform a similar mind­

reading exercise with other gestures. By looking at the gestures, we can

discover, for each person, what was highlighted, what was relevant and

what not, and from this infer the imagistic side of their utterances. The

five up-the-pipe gestures their own choices ofwhat

wdaesmsoalniestnrta.tSeohmoewofinthdeivseidcuhaOlI. csepseaakreerrsevmeaaldede

in speech but not necessarily all. All five speakers included upward move­

ment and all omitted details of the character's appearance. But each

speaker also emphasized other details that were not emphasized by the

others. Thus, for every speaker we infer that upward movement was sa­

lient. For speaker 2 we also infer that clambering wa� sali�n� ; for speaker 3 that interiority was important; for speaker 4 tha: mtenonty a.nd man­ ner of movement was important, etc. The followmg remarks Illustrate

how the up-the-pipe gestures can be interpreted.

SPEAKER 1 (see fig. 4. 1 ) :

The example was "he tries going [up the inside] ofthe drainpipe." The

gesture presented a blob hand, upward movement, and an extended fore­

of the character, the blob corresponds to the character himself, and the extended forefinger corresponds either to the interiority of the path (the character compressed inside the pipe) or to the character's final destination-either way, something connected with the path. We infer that the salient elements ofthe scene for this speaker were upward move­ ment and something about the path of movement. On the other hand, details about the character's person were unimportant-not even his limbs were hinted at.

SPEAKER 2 (see fig. 4.2) : The example was "he tries climbing up the [drainspout] ofthe build­
ing." Like speaker 1, speaker 2 used a gesture that also presented a blob hand and upward movement, but added wiggling movements ofthe first and second fingers. The blob was equipped with feet, and we infer that the clambering up the pipe was salient for this speaker, whereas the first
speaker had not selected this detail. The speaker, indeed, said "climbing," a verb conveying a clambering manner ofmovement, while the first had said "going"; thus both spealcers' linguistic choices and gestures were coexpressive (as usual, their gestures slightly anticipated the speech in their preparation phases) .

SPEAKER 3 (see fig. 4. 3 ) : The example was "and he goes [up THROUGH] the pipe this time."
The gesture againpresented something moving upward, but in addition strongly emphasized the interiority ofthe pipe path. This the speaker did with a "basket-hand," made with the palm facing up, the digits extended, separated, and slightly bent; all of this was the hand shape that moved up. The gesture thus included distinct semantic parts: a moving entity, upward movement, and a shape suggesting hollowness. Note that each semantic component was assigned to a different kinesic aspect ofthe ges­
ture: thus each meaning was symbolized in its own part of the gesture; motion ofthe entity was conveyed by motion ofthe hand, direction by direction ofthe hand, and hollowness by shape ofthe hand. Yet all three were combined into a single gesture-symbol that presented the elements
simultaneously. Such is a synthetic gesture: distinguishable meaning seg­ ments broughttogether into a single symbol-hand. The gesture took the basket form it did because of the immediately preceding gesture by this speaker. It thus shows the influence ofprevious gestures on later ones. In the cartoon Sylvester makes two attempts to reach Tweety, the first on the
outside of the pipe, the second inside. Speaker 3 described the first by

1 12

Varieties of Gesture

saying: "he crawls [up a pipe]" and simultaneously performed a blob­ rising gesture with no additional features for the path, for the manner of movement, or for anything else. Then she went on to describe the event: "and when he gets up to the bird the [grandma hits him] over the head with the umbrella," with a hitting gesture at the bracketed portion. Then she came to our example, "and he goes back and he goes [up THROUGH] the pipe this time," and the basket-shaped gesture. Thus this basket­ shapedgesturehighlightedexactlywhatwas distinctive about the second ascent: that its path was inside the pipe in contrast to the previous path on the outside. It is true that the first ascent had "exteriority" just as much as the second had "interiority," but at the moment ofthe first ascent there was nothing noteworthy about the path; the ascent itselfwas the novelty. These gesture depictions thus spotlight the scene in a way that we can plausibly take to be how the speaker herselfwas thinking ofit, that is, in terms ofwhat is novel and contrastive. The speaker's mind was moving forward on a stream of contrasts and in her gestures we see this process externalized.

SPEAKER 4 (see fig. 4.4) : The example was "this time he tries to up in[side] the rain gutter, you
know [ . . . ] [barrel]ing up through it." The first gesture depicted an undifferentiated blob moving up. The second depicted a rotational movement, coexpressive with (and anticipating) the verb "barreling" in speech. The third gesture depicted an undifferentiated blob moving up and anticipated the rest ofthe verb phrase, "up through it." Note that the rotational movement, like the clambering movement in the second speaker's gesture, is an inference: in the cartoon itselfthe character is in­ visible inside the pipe (see the Appendix for a line-by-line description of the cartoon). Nonetheless, the speaker inferred the manner of move­
ment, and this inference appeared in the gesture.

thumb was tucked into her palm as her hand flexed upward, and thiS could have conveyed interiority; thus the gesture may have supple­ mented speech, which did not mention that Sylvester was inside the pipe. At the same time, however, there was nothing in the gesture to convey
the manner in which Sylvester was moving and so the verb, "climb," in­ cluded more information than the gesture. This example thus is unusual
in that it illustrates speech supplementing gesture as well as gesture sup­ plementing speech. Ifthe primitive version ofthe sentence was an image

ofclambering up the inside ofthe pipe, we have a case where some parts ofthis image were manifested in speech and others in gesture.

POINTING IN A CONVERSATION. Mind reading is also possible in non­ narrative discourse. In the example ofthis section it is a conversation in which a speaker unwittingly reveals something that he was attempting to conceal. Pointing is really a form of abstract gesture (see chap. 6), but I include it here among the gestures ofthe concrete as another example of mind reading. I used this conversation in chapter 1 to illustrate deictic gestures, and now we see more of it. The participants were previously unacquainted male graduate students at the University ofChicago. The tape was made as part of a research project on face-to-face interaction by Starkey Duncan (Duncan and Fiske 1977). The two students were sim­ ply brought together before a video camera and told to have a conversa­ tion. This command typically elicits a series ofmaneuvers during which the participants try to find a common theme about which they can talk. The example we are considering is from this introductory phase; it ends with the participants' discovering a workable theme, but only after a cat­ and-mouse game that is the substance of my example. In conversations no less than narrations the predominant gesture is pointing when a new theme is sought (this is explained in chap. 7). So it was here. One of the participants, H, was trying to find something that could serve as a topic ofconversation. In the way ofstudents he asked where the other student, 0, had gone to school before. 0, however, somewhat mysteriously held back; he did not wish to reveal certain details. In particular, he was avoid­ ing the question ofwhere he had been an undergraduate. His unexpected resistance led to the cat-and-mouse game over this issue. The excerpt be­ gins with two questions by H (see figs. 4.7 and 4.8) :
(4.6) H : is this your first year [here] ?
Points down to own space.

Figure 4.7. Pointing at the speaker's own space with the ques­ tion "is this your first year [here1 ?" The space is for "here," a word used here both for space (the university) and time (one's time at the univer­ sity). (Also see figs. 4.8-4. 1 1 . )

(4. 8) H : or [where did you] come from before? Points into shared interaction space andfinger circles.

Figure 4.8. Pointing at the shared space with "or [where did you] come from before?" Compare the finger angle to that in fig. 4.7. The speaker is now setting up a con­ trasting space for "before," drawing on the temporal sense ofthe "here" in the previous question.
The first pointing gesture in (4.6) marles as "here" the space where H is located. This "here" clearly means the University of Chicago, where the experiment was being conducted and where both H and 0 were stu­ dents. The second gesture in (4. 7) contrasts this "here" with the space it tiniotnrosdpuacceess,htahreesdpbayceHofan"bde0fo'r(vei."z.T, thheensepwacespwacheerweatshtehirerneespuetrcatilvinetgearzaecs! intersected, H and 0 being seated at an angle). This use of the neutral space for "where did you come from before?" fits H's desire to find a shared topic ofconversation. 0, however, answers noncommittally:
(4.9) 0 : urn Iowa. ! lived in Iowa
The conversation nextveered offinto a briefexploration ofIowa as a pos­ sible topic. However, that eventually petered out and H returned to pro­ bing O's past (see fig. 4.9) :
(4.9) H: did you [go to] school [there] or uh?
Points both times into the shared interaction space.

Figure 4.9. Pointing at the shared space with "did you [go to] school [there] or uh?" This gesture is con­ sistent with the space in fig. 4.8 and contrasts with the space in fig. 4.7, now drawing out the spatial sense of "here . "

Thus H is consistently using the shared space for the meaning "where you came from before." 0 answers (see fig. 4. 10) :
(4. 10) 0 : I did go to school [there] Points to upperlevel ofshared interaction space.

Figure 4.10. The second speaker pointing at upper layer ofshared space with "I did go to school [thereJ ." The speaker uses the shared space, but introduces an up­ per story. This enables him to differentiate his "there" from the first speaker's dangerous "there."
o uses the shared space, but incorporates a revealing variation. He pointed at a space slightly above the shared space, asifto signal that while his "there" was indeed "where he came from before," it was outside the space that H had marked offas a topic ofconversation. This clue is elabo­ rated on in O's next gesture (see fig. 4. 1 1) :
(4. 1 1 ) 0 : [ I went to school] here also Points to leftperiphery (i.e.) awayfromH).
Figure 4 . 1 1 . The second speaker now pointing outside ofshared space altogether. This gesture im­ mediately followed the one in fig. 4.10 and occurred with "[I went to school] here also." The speaker un­ wittingly maps the contrast between the city ofChicago and the University of Chicago onto space as a center space-left space contrast.
Clearly, this "here" is not the same as H's "here." Indeed, it is as far re­ moved from H's "here" as possible. I do not believe that 0 was aware of tipping his hand (so to speak), but his gesture reveals that he had di­ chotomized the space differently from H: the leftside was to be his "here" and this excluded the "here" ofH, which was the University ofChicago.

Varieties of Gesture

It apparently arose from an image in his mind that assigned different

spaces to the place where he had gone to school (another university in the

city ofChicago) and the University ofChicago. Through the gesture we

can read his mind to find a meaning which, at this moment, he was at­

tempting to conceal. The drama had a happy ending: shortly after this

crucial moment 0 capitulated and revealed that he had been a student at a

Jesuit college; it then marvelously turned out that H also had been a stu­

dent at another Jesuit college; so they talked about Jesuit education-a topic on which, ironically, 0 turned out to be the more enthusiastic par-

ticipant! The ability

ofgesture and speech as expressions ofmeaning, coupled with the poten­

tial for gesture to display what is most relevant. That is, the two-speech and gesture-cover the same idea unit in the formation of an utterance,

but become distinct in terms of relevance, and this is where the gesture

channel can reveal what the speaker thinks is hidden.

Expression of Meaning in Gesture
In this section, I will analyze some ofthe ways in which gestures express meaning. The focus is semantic. The use ofgestures to express pragmatic discourse content has a chapter ofits own (chap. 7).
FEATURAL IDENTITY. To compare gestures to speech, Elena Levy and I analyzed each gesture into kinesic features that could be compared to the semantic features ofthe verbs in the accompanying speech (McNeill and Levy 1982). We defined altogether 44 kinesic features, such as, for exam­ ple, Fingers Curled or Extended; Index Finger Extended; Palm Down, Up, Right, Left, Toward Self; motion Up, Down, Sideways (left or right), and so forth. This method was the distant ancestor to the current method ofgesture transcription summarized in chapter 3 . For verbs, we devised a set of 37 semantic features inspired by the semantic analysis methods of Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976). Our list included, for ex­ ample, Entrance/Exit ("he swallows the bowling ball") ; Downward ("he comes down the pipe") ; Horizontal ("he runs ahead of it") ; and End­ State ("it catches up to him" and "he swallows the bowling ball" again). We intended the meaning featurestocapture the meanings ofthe verbs in the specific senses in which the narrators used them in the narratives.
There is no necessary reason why the two sets offeatures, kinesic and semantic, should correspond in any given gesture-speech combination. There is nothing built into the coding method that would force a Down-

Gestures ofthe Concrete

117

ward verb to appear only with a Downward gesture, for example; it could just as well go with an Upward gesture or have no kinesic preference. In fact, however, we found a very good correspondence between the two arrays of features. For example, we found that 54% of verbs with the Downward meaning feature co-occurred with gestures in which there was Downward movement; 0% co-occurred with gestures in which there was Upward movement; 73% ofverbs with the Horizontal mean­ ing feature occurred with gestures that included a Left-Right movement feature, compared to only 8 % of gestures that moved Downward and 17% that went Upward.
The Downward meaning feature not only went with Downward movements, but also with Curled Fingers more than 60% of the time.
Curled Fingers seem to depict passive movement, such as falling under the influence ofgravity. The Downward meaning feature did not appear with the contrary feature of Extended Fingers, nor with Both Hands Moving in the Same Direction, nor with Reduplicated arm movements suggesting running. This total pattern of positive and negative associa­ tions with Downward suggests a coherent picture in which there is fall­ ing, falling under the influence of gravity, only one object moving, and motion otherthanlocomotion. Such a gesture occurred repeatedly in the cartoon narrations. It exhibits a prototypical situation in the cartoon story. The character was constantly falling from great heights, falling alone and involuntarily, definitely not moving in a way he would have been had he been locomoting on his own. The aggregate gesture profile that emerges from the correlations with Downward thus presents a pic­ turethatis typical ofthe cartoon narrative and conveys much more than a single verb could have done. So, even at the featural level, we can see a global picture emerging out ofthe gestural description.

USE OF TWO HANDS. Many gestures are performed with just a single hand. However, a significant number use two hands, and among the two-handed gestures there are two kinds. In some gestures the hands move in the same pattern but in mirror images. Such gestures do not seem to differ semantically or functionally from their one-handed coun­ terparts. In other two-handed gestures, however, the two hands perform different movements. For example, one hand depicts a character's open mouth while the other hand depicts the bowling ball going inside (see fig. 4. 12, for example, which also is line 33 ofthe narrative in chap. 3). The hands, considered separately, perform different movements but, jointly, create a scene in which there is a single event-the cat swallowing the bowling ball. This is a typical case ofa gesture with two differentiated

hands. In one hand there is a motionless reference point: e.g., the hand for Sylvester's mouth. In the other hand, active motion: the bowling ball going into his mouth. A similar distinction appears in many ASL signs between a static reference point and an active transformation (Klima and Bellugi 1979). The verbs that went with these gestures, moreover, con­ veyed what Vendler ( 1967) termed accomplishments: "they proceed to­ ward a terminus which is logically necessary to their being what they are;' ( 101). Compare chasing and catching up to-the latter is an accomplish­ ment. Two-handed gestures and their verbs thus also illustrate the inte­ gration of speech and gesture at the level of meaning. End-State verbs were accompanied with two coordinated hands 68% ofthe time, and En­ trance/Exit verbs 90% ofthe time. (Verbs lacking the End-State or En­ trance/Exit features went with two-handed gestures 40% of the time. ) End-State and Entrance/Exit imply actions that reach a goal. This is the "accomplishment" referred to by Vendler. For example, "to swallow" means that something was not merely moving toward the appropriate aperture but that it enters it and goes inside irretrievably; otherwise one has not swallowed. "To catch up to" similarly requires not only move­ ment toward a target but that a certain end state be reached, namely, that the target be reached; otherwise one has not caught up to but just chased. Thus the kinesic form of the gestures co-occurring with these kinds of verbs reflected the logical element of accomplishment. The speech and gesture forms were integrated around the theme of reaching a logical end point.
EXPRESSING THE VIEWPOINT. Another area ofmeaning where speech and gesture are coexpressive is the point of view, or the feeling of dis­ tance from the narrative. Consider the event in the cartoon story where Sylvester climbs up the pipe. This could be conveyed gesturally in either

Gestures ofthe Concrete

1 19

oftwo ways. One would be to move one's arms up and down, as ifclimb­
ing a ladder. Here, the viewpoint would be the character 's : we imagine ourselves playing the part ofSylvester-the pipe is in front ofus and we
move our hands up and down as if clambering. Such a gesture has a Character Viewpoint, or C-VPT. With this viewpoint we feel that the
narrator is inside the story. A different gesture for the same event would be to make the hand into Sylvester as a whole and cause it to rise upward. We see Sylvester before us, rising upward, but we are not part of the
scene. This gesture will be said to have an Observer Viewpoint, or 0-VPT. With this viewpoint, the narrator keeps some distance from the story. We have in the viewpoint distinction one ofthe most readily identi­ tied aspects of iconic gestures (Stephens and Tuite 1983 referred to this distinction as iconicl and iconic2> respectively). A C-VPT incorporates the speaker's body into the gesture space, and the speaker's hands repre­ sent the hands (paws, etc.) ofthe character. Previous C-VPT examples in this book have included the gesture that accompanied "and he bends it
way back." The speakerwas seeing the event as ifhe were the person per­
forming the act, rather than taking the viewpoint of an observer of the event. An O-VPT gesture excludes the speaker's body from the gesture space and his hands play the part ofthe character as a whole. Most ofthe earlier examples in this book have been ofthe 0-VPT variety (e.g., figs. 4. 1-4.5). Overall, in cartoon narratives, 60% oficonics have an 0-VPT, 40% a C-VPT (Church et al. 1989).

VERBAL MANIFESTATION OF VIEWPOINT. There are also linguistic manifestations ofviewpoint. The C-VPT tends to appear with transitive verbs and single clause sentences; the 0-VPT with intransitive or stative verbs and multi-clause sentences. Church and her colleagues ( 1989)
counted 80% of C-VPT event descriptions with transitive verbs and 1 00% ofO-VPT event descriptions with intransitive verbs. In the narra­ tive in chapter 3, 29% of C-VPT gestures were accompanied by multi­ clause sentences, compared to 76% of the O-VPT gestures (overall in that narrative 53% of sentences were multi-clause and 47% were single clause). In all ofthese cases, then, the viewpoint parameter can be incor­ porated into the utterance's linguistic form. However, this is not at all obvious until the gestural manifestation draws our attention to it.
The viewpoint of the gesture and the form of the sentence achieve
equivalent results in terms of distance. In the C-VPT narrators become participants and insert themselves into the gesture space. In the linguistic parallel there is a single clause and a transitive verb. The "he bends it way
back" sentence, with its transitive verb and single clause, was thus a typi-

120

cal C-VPT example. Another typical C-VPT illustration is "and drops it

[down] the drainpipe." In the gesture the hand appeared to grasp the

there is analysis of the event as if under magnification-the role of the

character is separatedout from the rest ofthe evefo1t. :rhus the form o�the

sentence, along with the gesture, expresses proX1ffilty to the story Ime.

The O-VPT correspondingly appears with complex sentences (mul­

tiple clauses) as well as intransitive or stative verbs. A complex sentence, in its own configuration, interposes distance from the act1on. An exam­

ple is "he tries [climbing] up the side ofthe building," where the act of

climbing is presented in the embedded clause and the upper c�ause ("he

tries") implies an outside observer ofthe that Sylvester does not succeed. (Trying

tion; it means trying without success.) In most ofthe 0-VPT examples

that we have seen, there is some such implicit distance interposed by the

linguistic form ofthe utterance through (4. 12), for instance, the sentence is "he

drainpipe," and this was accompanied by an 0-VPT gesture. The two

clauses ofthe sentence have differentrelationships to the story structure.

The upperone ("he tries") states an atti�u?e that imflies �judgme?t (t?e characterisn'tgoingto succeed), andth1SJudgment1mpllesnarrative d1S­

tance. The lower clause ("going up the inside ofthe drainpipe") refers to

the actual event in the cartoon. Sometimes the 0-VPT is not expressed

syntactically in this way, but still there is the speech-g�sn;,re �oexpression of distance. For example, "and then [you hear a s]trike (hne 38 ofthe

narrative reproduced in chapter 3) was accompanied by an 0-VPT ges­

ture even though it is a single clause. But the pronoun "you" in this case

codes the distance implied by the 0-VPT. It is the general "you" of an

unspecified observer.

VIEWPOINT AND EVENT STRUCTURE. The shifts between C-VPT and 0-VPT are not at all random; they reflect the causal texture of the epi­ sode. More central events in this causal texture are given the C-VPT, while more peripheral ones are given the 0-VPT. Statistical confirmation of this difference in centrality and peripherality is contained in the table below from Church and colleagues ( 1989), which is based on an analysis ofthree cartoon narrations. They used story grammar categories (Stein

and Glenn 1979) to classify events as Central or Peripheral. Central meant either (1) initiation of goal actions, (2) main goal actions, or (3) outcomes of goal actions; and Peripheral meant (4) setting state­ ments, (5) subordinate actions, or (6) responses to actions and outcomes (Stein and Glenn had a seventh category-describing the goal-but this was never depicted in gestures and was rarely described in speech). Using these definitions the two gesture viewpoints can be seen to appear in quite different contexts (table 4 . 1 ). Seventy-one percent of C-VPT ges­ tures appeared with Central events, and fully 93% of O-VPT gestures with Peripheral events. The examples in (4. 12-4. 15), successive lines in one speaker's narration, illustrate this association.

The C-VPT and near distance exclusively appeared with the impor­ tant events in this sequence ofcause and effect: the first character's drop­ ping the bowling ball down the pipe (initiation of the action) and the second character's ending up with it inside him (the outcome). These are the main points ofthe scene. The intervening events supported them but were not the main points, and they all got 0-VPT gestures and far dis­ tance. All the gestures were iconics and all the clauses were at the narra­ tive level, but the events and the clauses were not equal in terms oftheir importance for advancing the story line. The difference in centrality motivated the changes of distance, which were depicted in the gesture viewpoint.

VIEWPO INT AND COHESIVENESS. This link up ofviewpointwith event centrality or peripherality can be explained as arising from how the nar... rator keeps up a sense ofcohesion in the narrative. Cohesion is automat­ ically produced with central events: each event has its place in the causal sequence ofthe story and cannot be moved without altering the story. If the speaker is thinking of event G this is automatically cohesive with the other causal events F, H, and so forth. No extra viewpoint is needed to introduce and refer to the chain. When the event is more peripheral, however, this definite location in a chain may be lacking. A peripheral event is precisely one not on the main causal sequence; it is supportive of but not part ofthe central thread. Thus a secondary chain ofcomments comes into being to carry its own cohesion and that of the peripheral events. This added chain interposes distance from the story line events. Thus an observerviewpoint appears. This observer, among other tasks, is asked to provide the cohesion that cannot be generated by the peripheral events on their own. In short, one way of explaining table 4.1 is by the need for cohesive consistency: this cohesion is not automatic with pe­ ripheral events, and that induces an observer's point of view and dis­
tance.

DUAL VIEWPOINTS AND THE IRONIC. The gestures we have seen thus
far have had a single viewpoint. This is true even oftwo-handed gestures, such as "he [swallows it] ." However, there also are dual viewpoint ges­ tures. These present a scene simultaneously from two viewpoints, for ex-

Gestures ofthe Concrete

ample, a C-VPT and an 0-VPT. In cartoon narratives, at least, dual C-/O-VPTs tend to produce an ironic effect, by pitting one viewpoint against the other. This contrast requires, not a shift of viewpoint, but a contrast of viewpoints. In the example below, an observer is added to a C-VPT gesture at the very moment when Sylvester is presented as ifhe had captured Tweety, but the observer (the narrator) knows that this mo­ ment was in fact a prelude to disaster. The dual viewpoint ofthe gesture enables the narrator simultaneously to take Sylvester's role and to ob­ serve it. Sylvester has used a five-hundred-pound weight to catapult him­ selfup to the window where Tweety is perched:
(4. 16) and he [grabs] Tweety Bird
Iconic:grip handshape (a C-VPT) .
and as he [. . . comes back] down he [lands on the ground]

(See fig. 4.13). The downward trajectory is not the movement of the character's hand qua hand but movement of the whole assembly of the two characters plunging to the ground as seen from the outside. The viewpoints are kept separate since each viewpoint has its own kinesic fea-

Figure 4 . 1 3 . A dual viewpoint in two panels. Panel (a) is a single viewpoint (C-VPT) gesture for grabbing with "[he grabs Tweety Bird as he]" and (b) is a dual C-VPT/O-VPT gesture with "[ . . . comes back] down." Note that the hand remains in the grip that implies the C-VPT while it de­ scends, which implies a trajectory from the 0-VPT. There is an ironic comparison between the observer's view-who knows the upcoming denouement-and the character's-who thinks he has the bird at last.

ture(s) in the gesture, and these are nonoverlapping. The 0-VPT had the trajectory in this example and the C-VPT had the handshape. Althou�h there are two viewpoints and just a single hand, the gesture does not mlX

Confirmation of the irony implicit in the dual viewpoint gesture was

the next step in the speaker's narration. She kept up the dual viewpoint

character run off with the bird and then have Having two viewpoints was crucial to showing

the the

character's grip on his (assumed) prize versus the reality of the weight

falling on him. The narrator had set all of this up in the first dual view­

point gesture above. Here we find the gesture channel carrying most �f

the meaning, for none ofthese ironic contrasts appears in speech. (Th1s

example appears in chapter 3 in the narrative, lines 47-52. )

Another type of dual viewpoint combines the C-VPTs of different

characters. Such combinations appear when the speech of one character

is quoted. The accompanying example is from the McClave ofGeorgetown University (McClave, 199 1 ;

work see fig.

of Evelyn 4.14) :

Figure 4. 14. A dual C-VPT with "[you1 had your doctor go over to check out that person's claim" (McClave, 1991). Two character's viewpoints are represented, one that ofthe student himself (using his own body) and the other that of his examiner (the pointing hand). A child's dual C-VPT gesture is shown in fig. 1 1 . 16.

gesture appears particularly apt in this context. It sets up a consistent use ofspace where both characters have a locus and provides a diagram ofthe interpersonal communication that is taking place. So far as I am aware dual C-VPTs are restricted to this context: the gestures are deictics at the speaker himselfand the accompanying speech is a direct quote that is ad­ dressed to the speaker. We will see in chapter 1 1 that the dual C-VPTs of children are different in all these respects.
Dual voices were a key concept in Bakhtin's (198 1 ) notion ofthe di­
alogic imagination, or hybrid construction, where, for example, "the subordinate clause is in direct authorial speech and the main clause is someone else's speech" (306). Twovoices in a gesture present a verysimi­ lar situation. In the gesture two voices are "heard," or rather seen. As in Bakhtin's analysis, the dual viewpoint enables the narrator to present "two narratives, two styles, two 'languages,' two semantic and axiologi­ cal beliefsystems at once" (304).

RELEVANCE. Another manifestation of gesture-speech integration ap­

pears when we compare gestures on the dimension ofinternal complex­

ity. This dimension gives us insight into what is important, relevant, or

salient to the speaker in the specific context ofthe story, and is the basis of

the mind reading examples earlier in the chapter. Some gestures are sim­

pie: the hand flexed back for Sylvester rising up the pipe. Others are more

complex: the bends-it-way-back gesture, for example, had at least these

t, I

differentiated parts: the character's hand, the character's body, the rela­

tionship ofthe hand to the body, the shape ofthe hand, the trajectory the

hand followed, the shape of the tree, etc. (see fig. 1 .1). In between are

other iconics, such as the basket hand rising for Sylvester's ascending

through the pipe.

The swallows gesture, for example, involved two arms, a change ofhand shape (opening up), a marked shape, and space other than rest; it thus
earns a score of 4. The climbing gesture involved only movement ofthe hand (not even a departure from rest), and earned a score of O.
This variation in the complexity oficonics suggests a way ofdetermin­ ing what is salient or relevant to the speaker. Moreover, we find not only what is relevant, but the moment it becomes relevant. Adding a feature to a gesture implies a relevant detail. The exact moment the feature is added reveals when it is relevant. In example 4.21 (fig. 4. 12) thegesture implies that Sylvester's open mouth was relevant. The immediately preceding gesture (not shown) was made with the hands in the same position but with the right hand, rather than being an open space, being a rising blob. The rising blob was Sylvester, and the later open space was his mouth. When his mouth became relevant the hand shape changed. Salience is

context, and this is the generation ofpsychologicalpredicates. Consider coming up with the nextutterance ofa discourse. Thegesturesingles out what, to the spealcer, are the utterance's least predictable, most discon­
tinuous components. The crucial property that identifies gestures with psychological predicates is discontinuity from the ongoing context. Thus, we can infer that the speaker in (4. 18) had a psychological predi­ cate that representedonlyupwardmovement, while the speaker in (4. 19) had one that represented this movement plus the manner ofmoving. In chapter 9 I willmakeextensive use ofgestures for inferring psychological predicates.
Often, indeed, the gesture appears to be more capable than speech at
showing shadings of relevance. I believe there is a good reason for this, which arises from the contrasting natures of gestures and speech. In
speech there are obligatory elements, but gestures, precisely because they are idiosyncratic and not subject to a system of standards, are able to se­ lect only what is relevant or salient. This disparity between speech and gesture is evident when a complex sentence appears with a simple ges­ ture. In terms ofits linguistic structure, "he tries [climbing] up the rain barrel" is more complex than "[heswallowsit]," butthe firstsentence was. accompanied by a simpler gesture. In thisway, we may require the gesture to lmow what was relevant in the context. This conclusion would apply to efforts to analyzerelevance based purelyonlogicalgrounds (cf. Sperber andWilson 1987, which limits the discussion ofrelevance to verbal con­
texts) .

NEW MEANINGS. Finally, at the most extreme level ofthe gesture's con­ tribution to meaning, we have gestures that create new meanings. It is possible for gestures to convey aspects ofmeaningthat, inspeech, cannot be expressed at all except through elaborate paraphrases. This is not para­ doxical if such meanings are part of the initial "growth point" of the utterance (see chap. 8). They can be conveyed over the gestural channel, even if they are lost from the verbal one. In this section I show how ges­ tures can bring out meanings that are quite inaccessible to the linguistic code (they have low "codability"; Brown and Lenneberg 1954). Certain actions, for example, can be referred to linguistically only by means of elaborate paraphrases, but they can be depicted visually in a single ges­ ture. For example, in the following, a long pointed object is shown approaching and contacting a flat horizontal object from below. A lin­ guistic construction can be found that roughly describes this situation (the preceding sentence, for example), but no single verb describes it. A gesturehowever does conveythis action (see figure 4. 15) :

Conclusions
Perhaps the most important fact about iconic gestures is their ability to articulate what, from the speaker's point of view, are only the relevant features in the context ofspeaking. Thus the gesture lets us actually ob­ serve thoughts as they occur. Iconic gestures have this power precisely because they are unconstrained by systems ofrules and standards. They are not forced, as is speech, to include features solely to meet standards of form. Thus they can limit themselves to what stands out. Not only are gestures free in this way to incorporate the relevant dimensions in thought, but they also cannot avoid incorporating these dimensions. We ask what forms the gesture, and it is the speaker's construction ofmean­ ing at the moment of speaking. The gesture does not manifest kinesic form ofits own accord. It cannot help but expose the relevantdimensions

Experiment on Gestures ofthe Concrete

This chapter describes an experiment-the "mismatch" experiment-in which the communication ofmeaning to listeners by means ofgesture is shown. A decisive proof that gestures convey meanings is given by the fact that listeners are able to pick up these meanings when there is no other source than the gesture.
The experiment was set up in such a way that effects could be traced back to the individual gestures to which the listener was exposed. It con­ sisted ofpresenting a videotaped narration ofthe cartoon story to a sub­ ject and having her retell the story to a listener. The subject did not see the cartoon itselfand retold the story only from this videotaped narra­ tive. Unbeknownst to the subject, the videotaped narration was staged by us and included a number of mismatching gesture-speech combina­ tions. These mismatches ofspeech and gesturewere the stimuli. The ges­ tures and speech, taken separately, were in no way strange: only the combination was unusual and we took care that even this was not obvi­ ous. Subjects said afterwards that they noticed nothing peculiar about the videotaped narrative, and their assessment ofit never mentioned the phenomenon ofgesture. The data are the subjects' own speech and ges­ turesciuringtheirretelling. It isimportantto stress thatwe didnot expect the subject to repeat the mismatching combinations themselves. To the contrary, we hoped that they would introduce changes in their own nar­ rations that would remove the mismatches. For one pilot subject, for ex­ ample, the staged narrator described Sylvester exiting the drainpipe in these words: "and he [came out] the pipe," and performed an up-and­ down bouncing movement at the same time. The linguistic choice­ "came out"-conveys the cat'smovementin relation to a reference point but does nottellthemannerofmovement, thatwasshownin the gesture. The listener, in her version, said the following: "and the cat [bounces out] the pipe," thus bringing the verbal and gestural descriptions to­ gether and proving that the original up-and-down gesture had been stored in a form to which the speech process could gain access.
It is theoretically conceivable that such mismatches have no effects at all. Subjectively, gestures hardly register in consciousness. But experi­ ments by Feyereisen, Van de Wiele, and Dubois (1988) have shown that gestures can be tapped by viewers as sources ofinformation. Thus a mis­ match also might be tapped. Moreover, if speech and gesture are inte­ grated into one system for the speaker, theyshould also be integratedfor

135

the listener. The speaker's full meaning is carried, not by words alone, but by the combination ofwords and gesture. The verbal part ofthe mes­ sage may claim the listener's principal attention but the gesture can still significantly affect the information that is obtained. If the listener not only listens but looks, gestures should affect the listener's account ofthe
story.

The Mismatch Experiment
The mismatch experiment is like the standard narrative experiment ex­ cept that the stimulus is a videotape of another person telling the cartoon story. The listener (the subject in the experiment) watched this video but did not see the cartoon itself. Then the subject narrated the cartoon story to another person, and we videotaped the performance.
We introduced mismatches of three kinds: manner, anaphora, and point oforigin. The first involved a mismatch ofthe kinesic form ofthe gesture with speech, while the second and third involved mismatches in space. It turned out that mismatches of space have the more powerful effects. These experiments were carried out by a group ofco-workers in­
cluding Justine Cassell, Karl-Erik McCullough, and Kevin Tuite. 1 . Manner (form) : verbs that refer to motion but do not convey the
manner ofmotionwere combinedwith gestures thatdo convey manner. The earlier example where the narrator's hand bounced up and down several times was a manner mismatch. The verb "comes" conveys move­ ment in relation to a reference point but says nothing about the manner of motion-falling, rolling, running, walking, crawling, bouncing, etc. The gesture implies that bouncing was the manner.
2. Anaphora (space/.\ : anaphon·c pronouns ("he," "she," "1"t," etc.) were combined with gestures that shift the action to a space already identified with another referent. For example, the right space was established for Tweety and the left for Sylvester; then the narrator said "and he lunges for him" (he = Sylvester) and made a gesture with his right hand lunging to the right. This shift ofspace implies that Tweety, not Sylvester, did the lunging while the pronoun "he" implies continuity ofreference (that the lunger was Sylvester).
3. Pointoforigin (space) : twoverbally described actions were combined with gestures whose point of origin in space seemed to shift. For ex­ ample, the narrator said "and he holds out the cup" and appeared to hold out the cup with himself as the point of origin, and then said "and he takes his hat off" and appeared to remove a cap from Sylvester in front of him with the space in front as the point oforigin. Although the character

1 36

Varieties ofGesture

remained the same and there was no apparent shift of reference, the character appeared to leap to a new locus in space.

Procedure

A video of a narration with these mismatches and others was shown to four subjects, who then gave their own narrations. The Appendix gives the full script of the video and its mismatching gestures. The video was presented in three sections and the subjects recounted each section be­ fore seeingthenext; this was done to reduce memory loadandto enlarge the subject's narration quantitatively. The duration ofeach ofthe sections was about two minutes and the subject began her own narration imme­ diately after the section was finished.
The listeners were asked afterwards whether anything seemed out of

the way in the videotaped narration. No listener commented on anything

odd, and none said anything about gestures (their own or the videotaped

narrator's). Several subjects in fact admired the videotaped narrator's

lively style. The video thus apparently did not draw attention to the ges­

ture channel, and its effects on the subjects' own narratives did not de-

pend on the listeners havingpaid attention to gestures.

.

Not every clause on the video was accompanied by a gesture, and not

every gesture involved a mismatch, but at carefully programmed points,

a total of five anaphor, eight manner, and seven point of origin mis­

matches were displayed to the subjects.

Results
The mismatches that involved space (anaphora and point oforigin) very strongly affected the listeners. Some traceable effects showed up in 80% or more of the subjects' narratives at points where there had been an anaphor or point of origin mismatch in the stimulus. Manner mis­ matches had effects 25% ofthe time. So it appears that changes in space are the mostpotent. Whenmismatches didnothaveeffects, listeners pro­ duced a normal text and performed no gestures or performed gestures normal for the context.
What should be regarded as chance levels ofeffects in this experiment is hard to say, but the likelihood ofthe effects on gesture, space, and lan­ guage that we have observed occurring by chance alone seems very small. For example, rotating the space 90 degrees or switching referring terms are phenomena that almost never occur in normal narrations; yet they occurred after seeingmismatchinggestures. Even the 25% effect rate for mannermismatches would be far abovechancelevels. Subjectsnever said "bounce" or some other manner verb after having seen nothing in the

Table 5.1 gives the summary statistics from the experiment: first the type ofmismatch) in terms ofthe percentage ofmismatches in the stimulus
that had an effect on the subject's narration; then the affecting element of the mismatch stimulus that was responsible for the effect (speech, gesture, or both), in terms of the percentage of effects in the subject's narration that are attributable to the particular affecting element; finally, the affected elementofthesubject)s narration that was altered by the mismatch (speech, gesture, both speech and gesture, or the omission of a salient part), in terms of the percentage of mismatch effects that were of the indicated type. (Note that the figures in the latter two cases are calculated on the same basis: they both give the percentage ofthe affected elements in the subject's narration divided up in different ways.)
In all cases, the affecting element in the stimulus appeared to be the gesture, and it was never the speech. This is apparent in the examples quoted below. In the first example a reference error arose because the ges­ ture had been used in an inappropriate space, in the second a repair and space rotation arose because the gesture emanated from a new and unex­ plained point of origin, and in the third a lexical choice started from a
gesturebouncingup and down. However, this dominance bythe gesture

in the mismatch does not invariably appear. Subjects in a pilot study did produce examples where speech was the affecting element; e.g., the staged narrator said "Sylvester ingests the bowling ball, comes back out the pipe, and goes rolling down the street"; the subject echoed the un­ usual verb choice, "Sylvester ate-ingested-the bowling ball," actually introducing it in a repair.
Finally, the affected elements can be the subject's speech, gestures, or both; they are quite diverse. Gestures or speech are also sometimes omit­ ted after amismatch. "Omission" refers to gestures or verbal descriptions that are reliably present in normal narratives but are missing from a mis­ match narration. For exanlple, in one part of the cartoon Sylvester smashes into a wall. Normally this denouement is depicted in a gesture, but in mismatch narrations the gesture was sometimes omitted, perhaps because this was a way of resolving the spatial inconsistency the mis­ match had engendered. The omission numbers are the least reliable, however, since inevitably some omissions would have been missed and/or some omissions that occurred were actually due to other causes than the mismatch in the original stimulus tape.

Interpretation of Mismatches
In general the mismatch experiments show that gestures affect listeners to a surprising degree, particularly when the mismatching gesture in­ volves a change of space. It thus seems plausible to claim that gestures play a part in communication even when speakers and listeners are not paying attention to them.
What is the mechanism ofthis communicativeness? Since the listener reports no particular awareness ofgestures as such, it does not work by the gesture's calling attention to itself. This in itself is not surprising. Most listeners are not aware of the phonetic or syntactic structures of what is said to them either, but the speech channel functions effectively without awareness. Nonetheless, a gesture-speech mismatch, even if it does not trigger consciousness ofgesture as such, couldset offan unusual process ofinterpretation and memory in the listener. This is precisely be­ cause the gesture and speech fail to match, and the listener tries to con­ struct a speech and gesture combination where they do match. Listeners must store the cartoon story in memory, retrieve it later, and build their own version for retelling. Ifwe suppose that a speech and gesture com­ bination cannot be formed in which there are contradictory parts, then the subjects must come up with their own combination that avoids the contradiction. Examples reveal subjects going to quite radical lengths, transforming space and speech in striking ways, to avoid such conflicts.

Example 2 illustrates this dual transformation in a subject whose drive for consistency led her to alter the linguistic and spatial components at the same time.

Examples ofMismatch Efficts
I have picked a diverse sample to illustrate the effects of mismatches on listeners :

REFERENTIAL ERROR FOLLOWING AN ANAPHOR MISMATCH (SPA­
TIAL) . The mismatch was that, in speech, a cohesive pronoun reference was made to Sylvester: "he lunges"; but in gesture this was combined with a shift ofspace: the lunging was done by the right hand, which had
previously been used for Tweety. Thus while in speech there was cohe­
sion, in gesture there was discontinuity. Although the subject describes the same scene, her description is dif­
ferent from the videotaped narrator's in organization and style. Thus we can be fairly sure that she was recounting the story and creating gestures
on her own. The critical detail in her response was an error ofreference­ saying Tweety for Sylvester-followed by a repair. This error corre­ sponds to the appearance in the stimulus tape of Sylvester in Tweety's space. The speaker's own gestures pointed to thefront, andthen showed the lunge to the right. When the speaker repaired the reference, saying "I mean Sylvester," she repeated the same gestures, making an identical de­ ictic to the front space andthelunge to the right. Thus thegesture during the repair was the same as during the error, but the speech was now cor­
rected. The repair of''Tweety'' by "Sylvester" showsthatshedetectedher error, while the use of the same gestures shows that the gestures them­ selves were not part ofthe error; on the contrary, the gestures were held
constant while the verbal reference was changed. On the left below is a description ofthe event as presented in the stim­
ulus tape, and on the right is the subject's rendition of the same event. The mismatch in the stimulus is identified. The error in the subject's re­ sponse occurs in the third line, and the repair in the fifth line.

) The L�XICAL REPAIR FOLLOWING AN ORIGO MISMATCH ( SPATIAL . mIsmatch was that first a gesture in the stimulus appeared to emanate
from the speaker's own locus-it was the speaker who was the character performing the action-but then a second gesture depicting the same character performing a second action appeared to emanate from a locus in front of the speaker. The character was the same, and he had not moved from one place to another. Instead, the point oforigin ofthe sec­ ond action was in a new place, and the character seems to have suddenly
materialized in this new place. This mismatch had a series ofconsequences for the subject'snarrative.
The crucial details are a (seemingly) unmotivated repair of verbs­ "hijacks" fo� "kidnaps"-and the subject's own shift of the gesture space-movmg the character Sylvester away from herself and into the
space in front ofher, at the precise moment ofthe repair, while simulta­ neously making herselfinto the victim.

This example will be revisited and analyzed from a different point of view in chapter 9. It was presented originally in a paper with Nancy L. Dray (Dray and McNeill 1990). I will use parts ofour interpretation ofit
here. The repair of "kidnaps" by "hijacks" is peculiar because the situa­ tion being described had few ofthe usual featural specifications ofwhat might be seen as a straightforward hijacking-there was no vehicle, no path to be deflected from, no movement with a vehicle away from the scene ofthe hijacking. None ofthese features existed in the situation of Sylvester's mugging the monkey and taking its clothes. Still, while the speaker seemed to be unhappy with her word "kidnap," she was appar­ ently satisfied with "hijacks." It appears that the subject was focusing on some dimension of Contrast in which "hijack" was directly opposed to "kidnap." Hergestures provide a clue towhatwastaking place. Exactlyat the moment ofthe verbal repair, there was a dramatic gestural repair of who occupies the subject's own space-at first thekidnaper/hijackerand
then the victim. In lines (3) and (4), where the speaker's hand reaches to the front, it is either Sylvester or an observer-certainly not the monkey-and in (6) and (7) it becomes the victim, the monkey, and cer­ tainly not Sylvester or an observer.
We can explain the new spatial arrangement and repair of"kidnap" as arising from the mismatch in the stimulus. In the stimulus, the first ges­ ture placed Sylvester at the speaker's locus, while the second gesture
shifted him to the space in front ofthe speaker; this occurredwithoutany corresponding linguistic description for movement ("he steals his cos­ tume, then Sylvester dresses up"). The subject's spatial shift precisely matches this shift in the stimulus tape. She moved Sylvester from her

142

Varieties of Gesture

own locus to the space in front ofher. Her verbal repair of"kidnap" by "hijack" in turn can be seen as the subject's maneuver (doubtlessly carried out unconsciously) to provide linguistic coding of the new spatial ar­ rangement that was missing from the stimulus tape because of the mis­ match. "Kidnap" focuses on an intruder absconding from a place he has intruded into: "hijack" focuses on the intruder coming into the place. Thus the repair precisely encoded the new space. Whereas "kidnap" fit thespace before itwas shifted, "hijacks" fitthe space after, for bythenthe monkey was at the center and Sylvester out in front commandeering the clothing. Thus the subject avoided the mismatch in her own narration. It is clear that the shift in the stimulus ofthe point oforigin ofaction was registered by her, since it was this mismatch that set the chain ofevents
offin the first place. As this analysis ofthe subject's speech and gesture space implies, the
subject assimilated the mismatch while she watched the stimulus tape. This hadwide-ranging consequences forher narrationonboththeverbal and gestural levels; what occurred in these channels cannot be explained
without referring to the mismatch.

Like the LEXICAL CHOICE FOLLOWING A VERB MISMATCH (FORM) . "bounce" example mentioned earlier, the mismatch involved a verb that does not convey any manner of motion. The accompanying gesture showed the manner ofmovement-bouncing up and down. This man­ ner reappeared during the subject's retelling, although not as a gesture but as a lexical choice. She said "goes down stairs" although no stairs had
beenmentionedin the stimulus at all. Thus, theup-and-downmovement originally in a gesture resurfaced as a lexical choice, in which the jagged outline implied in the up-and-down gesture is a dominant feature. At the same time, the subject normalized her own gesture-the character fell straight down and there was no bouncing. Thus the visual contour ofthe up-and-down gesture in the stimulus hid been assimilated but not neces­ sarily remembered in the form ofagesture, or even as amannerofmove­ ment. The resurfacing ofup and down in a lexical choice implies that to the subject the modality ofinput-gesture or language-was not clearly
distinguished.

SUMMARY. These examples seem convincing enough. The specific ges­ ture was part of the meaning the listeners were picking up. For the lis­ tener, as well as for the spealcer, the speaker's gesture and speech seem to form themselves into a single process.

What This Experiment Shows
I have been arguing in these chapters that, for speakers, gestures and speech are aspects of a single process. Each form contributes its own unique level of representation and the total representation is a synthesis of imagistic and linear-segmented modes. The mismatch experiment suggests that the same synthesis occurs in listeners. When you under­ stand someone you, too, form a single unified combination of imagery and speech. The imagery is an integral part ofyour comprehension. Ifthe speaker provides gestures, they are taken in-unconsciously-and com­ bined with the verbal stream to recover the conveyed meaning. If there are no gestures, as in listening over the radio for instance, the process is not necessarily different. On rare occasions, listeners generate their own gestures. Figure 5 . 1 is such a case. This is the one case we have found where the listenerprovides the gesture to go withthe speaker's utterance:

Figure 5 . 1 . Gesture by a listener (the nearer figure) demonstrating image construction during speech comprehension. The listener was not speaking. The speaker was say­ ing "[these are all in order] the way I've described them," and per­ formed a gesture to his left; simultaneously the listener per­ formed the same gesture to his left (not imitating the speaker, there­ fore, but tracking him).

Although rare, the existence of even one such example demonstrates that listeners can and do build up matching imagery to accompany the speech they hear.

Gestures oftheAbstract

So farwehave seen howgestures exhibit images ofevents andobjects in a concreteworld (real or fictive). Gesture imageryis notlimitedto the con­ crete. Other gestures exhibit images of the abstract-abstract concepts and relationships that are displayed in gesture form. One important class of such gestures I call metaphoric. Metaphoric gestures create images of abstractions. In such gestures, abstract content is givenform in the imag­ eryofobjects, space,movement, and thelike. Otherkinds ofabstractges­ tures are beats and (abstract)pointing. Each type ofgesture is described in this chapter. But first we should consider the issue ofhow something as concrete as a gesture can display abstract concepts at all.
Images of the Abstract
There is no lack of means for describing the relationship of imagery to the abstract. I will mention three approaches.
KANT'S SCHEMATA. Kant introduced the term schema to refer to a pro­ cedure for generating an image of a concept (Kant [1787] 1973). A schema for the concept offiveness, for example, enables us to generate a "sensuous image," such as "I I I I I ." Gestures also can be regarded as the products ofschemata; this is true ofboth iconic and metaphoric ges­ tures: Kant's analysis applies to both. Glucksberg and Keysar (1990) have argued that the so-called literal and metaphoric comprehension of words are fundamentallythe same. Their argument implies a continuum between the literal and the metaphoric. Invoking Kant's schemata also implies a continuum between iconic and metaphoric gestures. Between the gestures, the homology of an iconic gesture is imposed by external reality, bynature: a blob is homologous to a boundedphysical entity and upward movement is homologous to moving up, and we have no power to alter them. In a metaphoric gesture, the homology is one of our own creation. Ifwe think ofa story as a boundedentity,we can create an image of this kind of thing. The difference between the iconic and metaphoric, from this schema viewpoint, comes down to whether the homology is copied from the world (iconic) or created by the mind (metaphoric). This points up, indeed, one ofthe major sources ofscientific interest in metaphors, whichis to identifythe constraints on the creation ofhomo1ogies (see LakoffandJohnson 1980). Such created homologies could be
145

146

Varieties of Gesture

called "schematic" (in the Kantian sense), but I am calling them "meta­ phoric" to emphasize the distinction between metaphoric and iconic gestures, and also for historical reasons (a major type ofmetaphoric ges­ ture, the conduit, was first identified as a metaphor oflanguage; Reddy 1979).

VEHICLE, TOPIC, AND GROUND. A second approach emphasizes the analytic categories introduced by I. A. Richards (Richards 1936) and ex­ tended and renamed byMax Black (Black 1962). In the familiar Richards terminology, these categories are the Vehicle, Topic, and Ground. An ex­ ample is the expression, "life is a flowing river." Here the Vehicle is "a flowing river." In a gesture, the Vehicle is the gesture image itself. The
Topic of the metaphor is the abstract concept that the metaphor is presenting-life or the story genre. The Ground, finally, is the common ground ofmeaning on which the Vehicle andTopic are linked. In "life is a flowingriver," the Groundis somethingakinto an uninterruptedflowor continuity, and/or confinement to apath. According to Richards, theVe­ hicle alters our understanding ofthe Topic, theconceptofaflowingriver altering the concept of life, a process he called "interanimation." Black corrected this to "interaction," since in his view both the Vehicle and the Topic are altered by the metaphor. The concept ofa riverandthe concept oflife are changed. This interaction is indeed a crucial test ofa metaphor and applies to metaphoric gestures as well. The very concept ofa story is altered through interaction with the image of a bounded container: a story becomes some kind of container. At the same time, our idea of a bounded container is necessarily changed-it becomes some kind of story genre. A reflection ofthis interaction is our conviction that a story and a container are similar. We say, in a Kantian vein, that the homology in a metaphoric gesture has been created. Equivalently, we say that the Topic is altered by the Vehicle and the Vehicle is altered by the Topic.

SIGN, BASE, AND REFERENT. Finally, we can describe metaphoric ges­ tures in behavioral terms that lend themselves to empirical analysis. In this approach, we distinguish between Sign, Base, and Referent (Mandel 1977; Cohen, Namir, and Schlesinger 1977). The Sign is the gesture it­
self, the handshape, movement, space, etc., that constitutes the gesture. The Base is the objective object or action to which the Sign is homolo­ gous. In the case ofthe bounded object gesture, the Base is, in fact, some bounded object. The Referent is the abstract concept to which the ges­ ture refers; a genre, for example. The term Sign reflects the origin ofthis

Gestures oftheAbstract

147

approach in the study of sign languages of the deaf (see also Kendon 1988b). We employed the Sign-Base-Referent approach in the coding
method described in chapter 3. To code a metaphoric gesture we specify all components-the Sign, the Base, and the Referent separately.

Types of Metaphoric Gestures in Narrative
Conduits
Metaphors whereby language, meaning, knowledge, art, genre, etc., are presented as bounded containers have been identified in linguistics under the name ofthe "conduit metaphor" (Reddy 1979; Lakoffand Johnson 1980). The conduit is actually a family ofrelated metaphors which runs like this: (a) meaning is a substance, (b) the substance is packed into a container, and (c) the container is passed on to a recipientover a conduit. For example, "there wasn'tmuch in it," where the"it" refers to a lecture, implies an image ofa lecture as a container and thecontents ofthe lecture as a substance (in short supply, unfortunately). "It's hard getting these ideas across" implies a conduit over which ideas ought to pass. These im­ ages of containers, substances, and conduits are only implicit in the words. Conduit metaphoric gestures, however, can depict the imagery directly. Holding up a bounded container creates an image of the con­ tainer (potentially filled with meaning). Showing this apparition to the listener demonstrates the reality ofthe conduit.
Most ofthe uses ofconduit metaphoric gestures in narratives are for performing pragmatic references to the textitselfor to the interpersonal context of the narrative situation; I will describe these uses in chapter 7. Such pragmatic references mean that the appropriate synchronization rule is pragmatic synchrony. On rare occasions there may also be seman­ tic synchrony, as when someone giving a lecture on linguistics refers to "a linguistic object" and performs a conduit gesture at the same time. But muchmore frequent are exampleswherespeechandgesture arequite dif­ ferent semantically, while pragmatically they have the same reference. The first of the examples below illustrates this divergence of levels: se­ mantically there is nothing in common between speech and gesture, but pragmatically both channels refer to the cartoon story as a genre.
Not onlywillwe see a large number ofconduitmetaphoric gestures in this chapter, we will also see languages where conduit metaphoric ges­ tures are systematically absent. This fact suggests that although the con­ duit metaphor lets us create our own homologies ofTopic and Vehicle, it is the product ofa certain cultural and linguistic tradition.

148

Varieties of Gesture

IN ANCIENT TIMES. The conduit metaphoric gesture indeed appears to
have been a part ofWestern culture for a long time. The earliest historical reference to it I have encountered is the following byMontaigne (himself fifteenth century), who attributed it to Zeno (sixth century B.C.) in this description ofthe degrees ofknowledge: 1

Zeno pictured in a gesture his conception of this division of the faculties of the soul: the hand spread and open was appearance; the hand half shut and the fin­ gers a little hooked, consent; the closed fist, comprehension; when with his left hand he closed his fist still tighter, knowledge. (Montaigne 1958, 272)

BASIC CONDUITS. An example of a conduit gesture is the following, which I have already cited, where the speaker is announcing the genre of
his upcomingnarrative (illustrated in figure 1.3, repeated here in figure 6.1 with an additional panel) :

Figure 6.1. Conduit metaphoric gesture with "it [was a Sylves] [ter and Tweet]y cartoon" (same as fig. 1.3, with one added panel). The idea ofa genre is presented as a bounded supportable object. In the second panel the speaker appears to open the object up.

149

and/or the idea ofthe upcoming narration; either way, an abstract con­ cept. The "conduit" was the channel of communication between the speaker and his listener. To conceive of a Sylvester and Tweety cartoon as an object and hold it up to the listener is thinking in terms ofthe con­ duit metaphor. There is a created homology between the two orders of things, the Topic (cartoon genre) and the Vehicle (a bounded, sup­ ported, and presented object). Indeed, after creating the object and hold­ ing it up, the speaker continuedwith the conduitimageryand proceeded to break it open, at (2); thus he revealed the container's "contents" (the identity ofthe cartoon).
A very similar type ofconduit gesture is the following:

(6.2) I have [a question]
Metaphoric: handforms a cupfor the image ofa question (a container) or the hand out to receive an answer (a substance) .

The cup is either the question (a bounded supportable object) or the speaker's hand ready to receive the answer (the answer implicitly a sub­ stance that can be placed there) ; either way, the gesture depicts an ab­
stract idea. Theseexamples illustrate the basic features ofconduit metaphoric ges­
tures: the hands create an image of a bounded, supportable object that represents an abstract concept.

VIRTUOSIC CONDUITS. The cartoon-as-an-object gesture led to a natu­ ral extension when the speaker appeared to break open the container to show the "substance" inside. The conduitlends itselfto this kind ofelab­
oration and the more extremevariationscan be calledvirtuosic. The most spectacular examples often appear during academic lectures; linguists, in particular, create vast structures of conduit metaphoric gestures, and often have I regrettednothavingvideo equipmentwithme atthetalks of colleagues who so firmly believe that words, phrases, and sentences are the only substantive parts oflanguage. I have here three other variations on the basic conduit image that can be regarded as virtuosic. The first example occurred during a film narration and is a gesture that presents the meaning of the past subjunctive mood of English; the others come from academic discussions. The past subjunctive-such as "if you had gone to Rome, you would have seen the Colosseum"-carries the mean­ ing of "a potentiality that is not an actuality" (Curme 1931). A poten­
tiality not realized as an actuality is what the gesture in the first example depicts. It was made with two basic conduit cup-of-meaning hands moving outward; then, suddenly, the cups vanished (see fig. 6.2.):

150

Varieties ofGesture

Figure 6.2. Virtuosic conduit with "even [though one might1 [have1 supposed." The hands spread outward (an image ofpotentiality) and simultaneously open to form cups of meaning; then they abruptly close. This closure is timed to coincide with the grammatical encoding ofthe past subjunctive, "have." The image is ofan expanding potentiality that vanishes: a fairly good picture ofthe past subjunctive (Curme 1931).

(6.3) even [though one might] [have] supposed

(1) Cup-shape hands move outfrom center to side: the idea ofpotentiality. (2) Hands snap shut: the idea ofnonexistence.

The cup-of-meaning hands conveyed the existence ofsome meaning; theoutspreadingis a commonimagefor apotentiality (cf. the gesture for "whoknowsr"); andthe finalclosure, timedto takeplace exactlywiththe linguistic coding of the subjunctive, made the cup-of-meaning vanish.
Thus the total effect was that a potential meaning had vanished. My second illustration was observed during an academic conference
and was not videotaped; thus the timing is inexact. The speaker was em­ phasizing the importance oforganization in a certain domain. While he was saying the word "organization," there was a conduit in which the classic cup-of-meaning handshapewas modified by rigidly extending and
separating the fingers. The image was ofthe desired rigidity ofstructure. This was experienced by viewers visually, butwould have been felt bythe speaker kinesthetically. The concept oforganization thus appeared to ac­ quire homology with forceful physical containment and the basic con­ duit metaphoric gesture was elaborated into an image of rigidity-the quality, the speaker was arguing, needed for bringing order into this do­
main.

My third example appeared during a NOVA telecast dealing with chil­ dren's language. Thevirtuosic touchis that tlle speakerturnshimselfinto an abstract idea, in this case into the theoretical Language Acquisition Device :

(6.4) he proposed that the Language Acquisition Device [would simply take in] . . . have a . . . take as its input
Metaphoric: both hands scoop up ((input)) and appear to shove it into the
speaker)s own mouth.

A metaphoric use of the body is highly unusual. Most speakers create a bounded entity and offer it to the listener, but rarely do they turn it on themselves and make their own body into a part ofthe gesture. The ges­ ture, however, was quite effective. Thelistener, too, is drawn in and finds himself face-to-face with the Language Acquisition Device, swallowing its meal oflanguage data.

Metaphorics in Geor;gian, Chinese) and Turkana
The conduit metaphoric gesture is not universal. In iconic gestures the direct homology of Base and Referent leads to a high degree of inter­ cultural overlap when the content is the same. In contrast, metaphoric gestures seem to be culturally specific. The schema for producing conduit metaphoricimages appears inthegesturesofsomecultures butnotothers. We have found excellent conduit examples in English, German, Italian, and Georgian narratives (the latter a non-Indo-Europeanlanguage), but no convincingexamples in Chinese orTurkananarratives (also non-Indo­ European, butoutside ofthe Western culturaltradition). These latter nar­ ratives contain metaphoric gestures of other kinds, but not gestures in which abstract ideas are presented as bounded and supported containers. An oddlanguage in this picture is Japanese. OurJapaneselanguage narra­ tors have performedmany conduitmetaphoric gestures. I do not have an explanation for the conduit image in these narratives, but all the speakers wehaveobservedhave been residents oftheUnitedStates for anumberof years.
The Georgian language narrator commented her narrative by point­ ing out that she works professionally in the area of film. These remarks were accompanied by numerous conduit metaphorics, ofwhich the fol­ lowingwas one (see fig. 6.3 at thetop ofpage 152).

Figure 6.3. Metaphoric gesture (conduit) by the Georgian lan­ guage narrator as she introduces the film story and says that she is a professional in the field. This very clear conduit appears with a non­ Indo-European language. The im­ age ofa bounded cup ofmeaning is not language specific but culture specific.
Metaphoric: handforms cup) loops to selfand then loops out) presenting the image ofherprofession asfilm historian to the listener.
This gesture also included a looping movement from the self to the interlocutor, evidently to refer to the conduit itself between the speaker and listener. The English conduit example, "itwas aTweety and Sylvester cartoon," also presented a cartoon-object to the listener, and gestures that highlight this interpersonal aspect of the image seem particularly prevalent at the beginnings of narratives. This not surprising since it is exactly at this stage that the narrator is setting up the channel of com­ munication and thus emphasizes the interpersonal context of the narra­ tive situation.
In a context where an English or Georgian narrator would perform a conduit, the Chinese speaker created a boundless substance that she then patted down (this is ametaphoric gesture also used by English narrators, but it is not the conduit). The gesture creates an image of a substance withoutform. Themetaphoris thatan abstractideais amass ofsomekind, a concrete substance, but it is not supported in the speaker's hands. In the course ofintroducinghernarrative,the Chinese speaker said (see fig. 6.4; transcription and translation by K.-E. McCullough and C. Wang) :
Figure 6.4. Non-conduit meta­ phoric gesture by the Chinese language narrator as she introduces the film story. The metaphor ap­ pears to be that the story is a substance lying in space before her; then she pats on it. In contrast to the conduit there is no container and no support of the substance. English speakers also produce this metaphor.

An abstract concept is "entified" but there is no boundary or con­ tainer. The image seems to be that something is plucked from the fore­ head and then released-"knowledge" rises up on its own and disappears (perhaps it is a puff of smoke or a bird). The image is not the Chinese speaker's picture ofan inert substance lieing flat on a surface or the con­ duit image ofa bounded container, anddefinitelynot the conduit but an image of something capable of motion on is own. Similar images of thingsmovingup and dispersing appear in the gestures ofotherTurkana speakers. Figure 6.6 illustrates a different speaker performing a gesture for the concept ofhaving nothing-only your body, as she says:

Figure 6.6. A non-conduit meta­ phoric gesture by a second Turkana speaker for the idea ofhaving noth­ ing ("he had only his body"). Again, there is the image ofsome� thing rising up. The final handshape resembles a conduit but the movement is quite different. This opening up of space to exhibit nothingness may be universal.
(6.8) la lowang kaye abuni kaye [akwan]
from side over he-brought over [his-body] 'from over there he brought only his body'
Metaphoric: something rises up and disappears-her image ofnothingness.
To understand these metaphoric gestures fully we would need much more insight into the cultural beliefs ofthe Turkana people. But we can at least say that Turkana metaphoric gestures suggest an image of abstract concepts very different from our own. In this image abstract concepts are not manipulated, as they are in the conduit, and may not be con� trolled by the individual personality, but are entities capable of moving on their own.
Metaphors Utilizing Space
There are cohesive uses ofspace where characters are assigned their own spatial regions and subsequent references to the characters are accom­ panied by gestures in "their" specific space (see chap. 7). Space also can be

given semantic content; in this itis used metaphorically. The speaker can conceive of the plot line, its dramatic content, and the characters as ob­ jects with a layout in space. Thus one part ofthe story can be set aside in space A and a contrasting part in space B. The following is an example where space is dichotomized to represent the relative moral statuses of three characters. The speaker places the actors according to his moral evaluations (see fig. 6.7). There is an opposition between the left space for the actual moral status ofthe characters, and two non-left spaces for their ascribed moral status. The speaker further subdivided the non-left space (ascribed, not real, morality) into the "bad guy" to the front and the "good guys" to the right. As Kevin Tuite writes about this example, ''The speaker has in effect represented the plot of the discourse as a
spatially-extended object, with distinct loci corresponding to distinct plot components" (Tuite, to appear) :

Figure 6.7. Spatial metaphors setting up contrasting spaces for moral statuses. Panel (a) shows the right space for ascribed status of"good guys." Panel (b) shifts left for actual status of "really did kill him." Panel (c) returns to the center for ascribed status of "bad guy." Panel (d) goes back to the left for actual status of"really didn't kill him." The four gestures diagram the moral oppositions of good and evil and true and false in a space en­ dowed with abstract meaning.
(6.9) everyone's morals are very ambiguous (6.10) 'cause [they're sup]posed to be the good guys
Metaphoric space 1: left handpoints rightfor (goodguys.))
(6.11) [but she] really did kill him
Metaphoric space 2: right hand moves left into center and head turns leftfor actual act.
(6.12) and [he's a] bad guy
Metaphoric space 1: hands move tofrontfor (Cbadguy.))
(6.13) [but he really] didn't kill him
Metaphoric space 2: hands and head move to left againfor actual act.

Varieties ofGesture

The moral ambiguity the speaker found in the film was visualized as space, then, and laid out like a map with spatial regions for the moral conflict. The absolute spatial assignments (left versus non-left or front versus right) had no significance in themselves: what mattered was the oppositions.
A metaphoric use ofspace appears in narratives regardless ofthe lan­
guage being spoken. I can't say if the spatial metaphors are the same in every language, but there are no obvious interlinguistic differences in the use ofspace metaphorically.

Metaphors Based on Beams and Auras
In addition to the conduit image of language, knowledge, genre, etc. as substance in a container, a number of gestural metaphors present con­
cepts of translucence, shadows, and mental states. A system of schemas
provides images of these concepts by playing on the idea of a beam or

aura. Some ofthe gestures embody ancient physical theories, which con­ tinue to live on secretly in gesture form.

METAPHORS OF TRANSLUCENCE. The ancients were puzzled by how we are able to see objects that lie at a distance. Various theories were of­ fered, one that the eye sent out beams that contacted the objects; seeing was thus likened to the familiar process of touching. The beams were called "eidola." (Figure 6.8 illustrates a recent example from a poster that
appeared around the University ofToronto in the summer of 1990.) A
common metaphoric gesture for vision has the hands depict beams leav­ ing the eyes in the direction of the thing being seen. The ancient eidola
theory lives on, in gesture form. A variation ofthis eidola gesture is the
following where a speaker describes a scene from a Hitchcock film in which there are superimposed images. This situation is depicted with eidola leaving the viewer and passing through translucent people. Thus, beams passing through an object also present the concept oftranslucence (see fig. 6.9) :

Figure 6.8. Eidola in a poster that appeared around the University of Toronto in the summer of 1990.

Figure 6.9. Eidola in a gesture for transparency. This accompanied "you can see through the people [into her] ." The right hand moves past the plane ofthe left and rotates as it moves. The metaphor for transparency is eidola passing through the target.
(6.14) people are walking by her and you can see through the people [into her] One hand held upfor ((thepeopl!!)while theotherhandfor ((seeing)) movespast thefirst hand.
One hand thus represents the translucent people and the other the eidola passing through them. The question is not whether the speaker believes in the ancient theory ofeidola; he certainly does not. But, unwit­ tingly, he reinvoked it, and in some sense the old theory was present, giv-

158

Varieties ofGesture

ing the visual process an active role of penetrating objects to reach the target of sight behind them.

METAPHORS OF MENTAL STATES. Beams or auras also are used to refer to mental states and mental operations. In the following, the gesture de­ picts wonderment emanating from the head (see fig. 6.10) :

Figure 6.10. Beams emanating from the head for a psychological state. This gesture accompanied "flying into the area [wondering] why all the animals are running away." The state makes itselfknown by an aura around the head.
(6.15) so uh . . . she's flying into the area [wondering] why all the ani­ mals are running away Metaphoric: hands radiate awayfrom headfor beams oFcwondering why.Y)
This movement of the hands away from the face or head is a quite fre­ quent gesture for manifestations ofall kinds. Infilms ofTapanese speakers I have seen gestures depicting beams that radiate out from the stomach. This corresponds to the traditional Japanese metaphoric locus in the gut for feelings, thoughts, and mental activities in general. Thus, the source of the beams may differ as a specific cultural property but beams them­ selves seem to be a widespread image ofmental states.
METAPHORS OF SHADOWS. A gesture depicting a shadow makes use of the same theory of outward radiating eidola, but now it is the shadow that departs the body and moves offthrough space (the expression, "to cast a shadow," embodies the same metaphor). In the following, again from the Georgian narrative, a shadow is depicted as detaching from a person and movingthrough space and finally hitting awall (see fig. 6.11; only the English translation is provided)
(6.16) [you see a shadow . . . the shadow ofa man in a top hat] Right hand is at arm)s length) with thepalm to selffor the wall. Left hand

Figure 6 . 1 1 . A shadow being "cast off" to contact a surface. This ac­ companied (in Georgian) " [you see a shadow . . . the shadow ofa man in a top hat] ." The left hand-the shadow-moves slowly up to the plane ofthe right hand which faces the speaker (it is the wall). This ges­ ture was immediately followed by another where the left hand-the shadow hand-drew an outline at the plane locus of the top-hatted figure.

slowly movesforward to line ofright hand, with thepalm tofrontfor the mov­ ing shadow. Left hand then outlines shape ofman in top hat.
The right hand faces the speaker to show the location ofthe wall; the left hand faces away from the speaker and is the shadow. The moving hand goes out to the plane of the other hand but is aimed to the side of it, which shows that the wall was the plane, not just the hand. The two palms are oriented toward each other, the palm in general being the busi­ ness side of the hand, and this is the image of the shadow as an entity gliding through space to the wall. The slow pace ofthe hand is a further significant feature. In the film the shadow is shown ominously creeping forward and upward onto the door as the shadow-caster slowly ap­ proaches. The gesture presents the low speed of this approach as a slow moving shadow itself. All of these images play with the basic eidola image.
Metaphors of Change
Finally, we reach gestural metaphors ofdynamic processes. Gestures are particularly expressive in this domain since the gestures themselves are dynamic. Gestures of change are among the most elaborate that one finds. In the second example below, the metaphor turns into a whole sys­ tem ofgestures.
TRANSITION. Metaphors for transitions or processes in general always seem to include some element ofrotation: the gesture conveys the transi­ tion as repetitive and/or cyclic, an image that appears to be based on ro­ tating wheels or gears, although there are no wheels or gears. In the following, the speaker refers to a transition in the film (see fig. 6.12)

Figure 6 . 12. A metaphoric gesture for transition or process. This ac­ companied "and now [we get] into the story proper." The metaphor for a process is something rotating cyclically/repetitively.
(6. 17) and now [we get] into the story proper
Metaphoric: hands supporting an object (conduit image) rotate (3 x) and moveforward (spatial image).
This was in fact a multi-metaphor gesture. There is a conduit object, for the concept ofthe film as an entity; forward motion in space, for the con­ cept ofentering; and rotation for the process-the whole is the speaker's image ofa transition into themain part ofthe movie.
TRANSFORMATION. The next example employs space metaphorically to present a highly complex transformation. The Georgianspeakerwas de­ scribinga scene from the film inwhichHitchcock had cleverlyjoined two scenes through the use of form, space, action, and time. One character (Alice) has killed another (the artist). In terror after her act she wanders the streets of London, reexperiencing scenes of the murder. She comes across a drunk lying on the street with his hand extended, in the same posture as the dead man. Then Hitchcock transforms the image ofAlice in the street into a second image of the artist's landlady when she dis­ covers the dead man. This was described by the narrator as follows (giv­ ing only the English translation) : "At this point a scream is heard from her, but this scream changes suddenly. The scream continues but the face changes and you see that landlady, who is standing exactly the same way as this woman stood in the street, and she is looking at a hand, but this is really the dead person's hand."
Repeatedly gestures leave the left space, which is the scene with Alice, and enter the right space, which is the scene with the landlady (see fig. 6.13). The gesture space was divided into old scene/new scene from the first, and the transformation of the first scene into the second was visu-

Figure 6 . 1 3 . The Georgian speaker's transformation ofone scene into another. This movement was repeated several times, once for each partial changeover. The meta­ phor is complex: the left side is the first scene; the right side is the new scene; and the movement is the transformation of the first scene into the second.
alized as a piece-by-piece shifting of the left gesture space over to the right gesture space. The space was thus divided, and the visual and acous­ tic lines with which Hitchcock linked the scenes became successive ges­ tural shifts from one space into the other. The speaker first shifted the scream, next the face, then the posture, andfinally the hand itself. (Com­ ments are in boldface; brackets omitted.)
(6.18) at this point a scream is heard coming from her
Left handpoints = scream. She sets up the scream on the left.
(6.19) but this scream changes suddenly
Left hand holds in midair. Right hand swingsforward and to the right. She continues the scream on the left, and contrasts it to the space on the right, which is the trans­ formation ofthe scream.
(6.20) the scream continues
Right hand holds in midair. Left hand beats. This reactivates the scream on the left while preserv­ ing the transformation on the right.
(6.21) but the face changes
Left hand holds in midair. Right hand swings forward and right again. Again, a transformation is accompanied by a gesture toward the right space, while the scream is held at the left.

Left hand holds. Right hand moves down andflnvard. This introduces one ofthe results ofthe transformation-the landlady-into theright space for trans­ formations.

(6.24) as this woman stood in the street
Right hand held in uprightposition Left hand loops down and to the right. The right hand is held in its posi­ tion to be the landlady standing and the left hand, which had been the scream in the first scene, is now transferred to the right space, the space of transformations, and this space now has become the trans­ formed scene in its entirety.

This first scene has now been totally transformed into the second scene. From now on, in perfect accordwith the basic left-rightdivision of
the space, all gestures with either hand are performed in the right space,
the space ofthe new scene, back at the artist's flat.

(6.25) and she's looking at a hand

This gesturalsolution to the problem ofdescribing an extremely com­ plex cinematic transformation was completely spontaneous. The succes­ sive shifts took place fluently as the links between scenes came up in speech.

Conclusion ofMetaphors in Narrative
An implication ofthe phenomenon ofmetaphoric gestures (ofany kind) is that the abstractness of an idea is no barrier to its receiving a concrete

T

163

reality in gesture form. Movements ofthe hands are perfectly capable of expressing abstractions. Conduit and spatial metaphors are instantly available. Metaphoric gestures are outnumbered by iconics in narratives, but this is because ofthe content ofthe narrative, not any inaccessibility of the gesture itself. On the contrary, metaphorics are among the most frequent of all gestures in other genres, especially conversations and lec­
tures.

Concepts That Take Shape
Metaphoric gestures differ not only culturally, but also individually. Each speaker may come up with his or her own images of the abstract. This follows from the nature ofmetaphoric gestures. They create homologies between concepts and image schemata, and this creativity leaves room for individuality. The images are idiosyncratic but share a core of mean­ ing. The same core schema, such as the conduit or investing space with abstract meaning, can give rise to quite different looking gestures. None­ theless, the gestures that present these images could arise from the same schema.
The title ofthis section is taken from Rudolph Arnheim's book, Visual Thinking ( 1969). In one chapter, Arnheim presented drawings by col­ lege students who had been asked to depict in graphic form such abstract concepts as past, present, and future, or a good marriage and a bad mar­ riage. Figure 6 . 14 shows drawings of past, present, and future done by students of my own, who were assigned some of Arnheim's concepts. The drawings are, in effect, metaphoric gestures on paper. Arnheim in­ deed referred to such drawings as metaphors: "This spontaneous use of metaphor demonstrates not only that human beings are naturally aware

of the structural resemblance uniting physical and non-physical objects and events; one must go further and assert that the perceptualqualities of shape and motion are present in the very acts ofthinking depicted by the gestures and are in fact the medium in which the thinking itself is taking place" ( llS). Drawing (a), for example, was described by the student who created it in these words : "Past: solid, yet fading in memory; pre­ sent: concrete and vivid; future: unknown, chaotic." We would expect a metaphoric gesture for the past by this student would also highlight
solidity-for instance, a solid object moving out of sight over the shoulder. Conversely, his idea of the future would suggest a gesture in which the depiction is ofchaos-the hands wiggling or flopping, for in­ stance. Drawing (b), from another student, was described as follows:
"Past is filled; present is occupied with one thought, action; future is empty because it is not known." Her gesture for the past might also high­ light solidity, but her gesture for the future should look quite different­ a quiet openness presented, perhaps, in the hands parting to create an empty space. Such drawings, like metaphoric gestures themselves, are idiosyncratic images of past and future. Yet the two students' very differ­ ent images of the future share a common opposition to the past which they portray as something solid and locked up. Though superficially dif­ ferent, both are component images of a system with a common thread. Such images are comprehensible to others since they capture "structural resemblances" or homologies. The ''very acts ofthinking" ofthe subjects are sharable and communicable in this way even though idiosyncratic.

Gesture of Mathematicians
I next describe a specialized type ofconduit gesturing that accompanies the technical discourse ofmathematicians. In certain respects these ges­ tures are unlike the narrative gestures that we have examined so far. The same gestures appear with different speakers and appear in much the same form in a range ofdifferent contexts; a gesture with a certain mean­ ing has a more or less constant form; and the gestures cover single con­ cepts. In all these respects mathematicians' gestures depart from the global-synthetic plan ofnarrative gestures. Yet, mathematicians' gestures resemble ordinary gestures in co-occurring with speech, being appar­ ently unconscious, not combining with other gestures, and being them­ selves not composed out of parts. The gestures are thus somewhere on the road to a gesture language, but are not all the way there.
Jacques Hadamard, himselfa mathematician, published in 1945 a slim

volume entitled, The Psychology ofInvention in theMathematical Field) in which he claimed that mathematicians think primarily in terms of im­ ages, both visual and kinesthetic, and only secondarily in terms of sym­ bols (including mathematical symbols). This was his own experience and was also the experience ofmany other mathematicians who responded to a worldwide survey that Hadamard conducted. Hadamard gave an ex­ ample (76-77) from his own reasoning to show how images carry math­ ematical meaning, which is repeated below. He is proving that there is a prime number greater than 1 1 (I cannot say if this is at all interesting from a mathematical point ofview, but the psychology ofit is interesting; the "I" in the following is Hadamard) :

Steps in the Proof

Hadamard's Imagery

A. I consider all the primes from 2 to 1 1, say 2, 3, 5, 7, 1 1
B . I form their product: 2 x 3 x 5 x 7 x 1 1 = N.
C. I increase that product by 1, say N plus 1 .
D. That number, i fnot a prime, must admit of a prime divisor, which is the required number.

I see a confused mass.
N being a rather large number, I imagine a point rather remote from the con­ fused mass.
I see a second point a little beyond the first.
I see a place somewhere between the confused mass and the first point.

It is not surprising that there should be gestural manifestations of these kinds of images. The images are mathematical in their references, but visual-kinesthetic in their presentation. In the Kantian framework, we can suppose that the images are products of schematas for mathematical ideas, just as "I 1 1 1 I" was the product ofthe schema for the concept of fiveness. We could call Hadamard's imagery metaphors of mathematical concepts of sets, products, divisors, and the like. Thus thinking in terms
of images imbued in this way with mathematical significance, mathe­ maticians could generate gestures that also are metaphors ofmathemati­
cal ideas. Some years ago I made a videotape of a technical discussion between
two mathematicians (Robert A. Morris and Michael P. Anderson).2 These speakers did indeed perform gestures in which mathematical con­ cepts were realized as visual-kinesic forms, as will be described below.

Varieties ofGesture

DUALS. For example, the concept of a mathematical dual was accom­ panied by gestures in which the hand rotates between n:o p?siti�ns (in a dual, a relation is replaced by its converse). The follow11g1 IS an Illustra­ tion (from McNeill 1987; see fig. 6. 15) :

Figure 6. 15. A mathematician's gesture for the concept ofa dual with "this gives a [complete du­ alityJ ." Typically, duality gestures involve a rotation.
(6.27) this gives a [complete duality] Metaphoric: right handpresents the idea ofa dual by looping upward.
The key feature in this gesture was the alternation. Other references to duality were accompanied by the same key feature although details might be different (rather than looping up, the hand might flop sideways, for example).
LIMITS. Other gestures also focused on particular key features that were appropriate for their particular mathematical concepts. The idea of a di­ rect limit was accompanied by straight-line trajectories followed by "end­ marking" (a tensed stop). A straight line with an endpoint appears to be an appropriate picture of a direct limit. An inverse limit, in �ontrast, was made by looping the hand downward and then upward. It IS hard to say whether this is an appropriate image ofinverseness, although such is pos­ sible I am told. It is also possible that the inverse limit gesture was con­ structed to contrast with the direct limit gesture. Here are two examples, first a direct limit and then an inverse limit:
A direct limit (see fig. 6. 16 at the top ofpage 167) :
(6.28) so the continuous linear dual is gonna be a [direct] limit Metaphoric: hand depicts a straight line with an endpoint.
An inverse limit (see fig. 6 . 1 7) :

SPEECH ERROR. Another example ofa limit gesture appeared during a speech error in which one of the speakers said, "this gives an inverse limit," but performed a direct limit gesture. The other speaker corrected the mistake and replied, "a direct limit," and also made a direct limit ges­ ture. The first speaker then accepted the correction, made a third direct
limit gesture, and repaired the words, "I mean a direct limit." The error was therefore confined to the speech channel, and was a purely verbal er­ ror, while the gesture proceeded in terms ofthe appropriate metaphoric image. What took place in this error demonstrates Hadamard's claim that thought in mathematics is more closely connected to imagery than to language. The error also points to the theory that the gesture (and the

imagery behind it) is the initial form ofthe utterance and that lexical pro­ cesses come later.

OTHER CONCEPTS. The mathematicians had distinctive gestures for other mathematical concepts, such as quotients, factoring, maps, flat­ ness, and compactness/finiteness; each was distinct from the others, con­ stant in terms of the key features preserved over different occurrences, and similar between the two speakers. Finiteness and compactness, for example, were a tightly bounded space, flatness a flat plane, factoring and quotients a vertical separation ofspace, etc.

MATHEMATICIANS' GESTURES AS "WORDS." An observation that sug­ gests a somewhat specialized gesture mode is the linguistic segments with which the gestures coincided. As the examples suggest, the spoken text included: "complete duality," "direct," "inverse limit," and so forth; there were no gestures coinciding with phrases or clauses, let alone with complex sentences. Moreover, the gesrures tended to coincide with nom­ inal referring terms rather than with verbs. The narrowed temporal locus plus the tendency to associate with nouns suggests gestures that are not global and synthetic, but rather are segmented more like words. Thus it may be appropriate to think ofthese gesrures as imagistic words that take the place oflinguistic words, at least within the confines ofthis particular interaction, and in this respect gesrures with uses quite different from anything found in spontaneousnarrative discourse. When Hadamard in­ sists that mathematicians do not think with linguistic words, we should ask ifinstead they are thinking with gestural words.

Other Kinds of Abstract Gestures
The ability ofgestures to refer to abstract meanings is not limited to met­ aphorics. In particular, besides these imagistic gestures, beats and ab­ stract uses of space greatly add to the expressive power of the gesrure channel. Finally, there are abstract uses ofgesture repetition.

T

Gestures oftheAbstract

169

Beats
The semiotic value ofthe beat is that something is significant, not for its normal referential value, but because ofits relationships to the overarch­ ing discourse. It is somewhat akin to using ahighlighter in awritten text. The marked word is made to stand out of its normal context, and this highlighting sends us, the reader, in search of a different context for the word. Extra emphasis on a word when it is in a normal context induces us to seek or invent a different context for it, and beats function in a similar way. Beats, in analogous fashion, signal that the word they accompany is part ofsome other context than the one that it is immediately presented in. Very often the external context is the larger discourse. Although beats are simple as movements, they are cognitively complex. They do not emerge in children until age 5 and are not abundant until age 1 1 (chap. 1 1). The limiting factor appears to be whether the child has developed the narrative structures in terms of which discontinuities and relation­ ships to the external context can be defined. Young children have not yet developed them and thus have no basis for beats, despite the motoric
simplicity ofthe gesture. The following examples illustrate typical contexts in which beats ap­
pear during narratives by adults and older children; in every example, the beat marks the relationship of the word it coincides with to the larger context.

REPAIRS. The speaker mentioned one of the characters and decided to use a more specific referring term:
(6.33) and the bird . . . the ca[NAR]y . . throws a bowling ball
Beat.
The beat markedthe word thatwas the repair itself, not theword deemed in need of repair (bird). With a repair, clearly, the relationship ofthe re­ pairing word to its context, the word it is replacing, is crucial, and the beat highlights this relationship.

NEW CHARACTERS. When a character is introduced into a narrative, the mention ofthe character is important for its relationship to the story as a whole, not for anything the character is then doing. For example, this was the first mention ofGranny in one narrative:
(6.34) and [the old] woman who keeps Tweety
Beat

The reference is not to the character performing an action in the story, but on a different level to her being introduced as a character.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. In the following, the introduction of a new character is accompanied by a conduit presentation gesture, but when her two names are mentioned, each is accompanied by a beat. Moreover, the second beat accompanies exactly what was the added in­ formation, viz., her family name, even though the first name was also re­ peated:

SUPERIMPOSED ON OTHER GESTURES . The above examples ofbeats all occurred alone, when the speaker was departing briefly from the main story line to repair something, to introduce a character, to add furth�r details, etc. It is also possible to highlight words in relation to other ges­ tures. In these cases an iconic or metaphoric gesture has beats superim­ posed on it. Each beat signals that the word it accompanies should be interpreted in relation to the gesture image. The following is such a case, where beats are added to an iconic gesture in the Chinese narrative ofthe
film story:

(1) Iconicfor holding slip ofpaper continues. (3) and (4) superimposed beats (b) and (c) .
This example was analyzed with Nancy L. Dray (Dray and McNeill 1990) in the following way. Throughout the passage, paperholding was central to the scene, but first (beat a) it was a piece of paper regarded as paper (a physical object), then (beat b) it was a piece ofpaper regarded as a note (with writing on it), and finally (beat c) it was a piece of paper regarded as a message-bearer (transmitting a message from the other man). Each of the points of reanalysis of the role of the paper was indi­ cated by a beat superimposed on the iconic gesture of paper holding. Maintaining the iconic gesture throughout, the speaker was maintaining a focus on the paper (which corresponds to its importance in the scene of the movie), and at another level, marking contrasts within that con­ tinuity, corresponding to the different ways the paper was being repre­ sented. Thus, we find superimposed beats when narrators are presenting events on multiple levels and relating words to an ongoing iconic ges­ ture.
Bearing in mind the constant temporal relationship of gestures to speech, we can say from the phenomenon ofsuperimposed beats that, in their primitive stages, utterances are already organized on both narrative and metanarrative levels (see chap. 7).

Gesture space itselfcan be endowed with abstract meaning. For example, a part ofspace can be identified with a particular character or place in the story. Then subsequent events involving that character or place may be accompanied by gestures in the same space. This produces a cohesive linkage, and often there are linguistic reflections of the cohesion in choices ofwords and sentence structures, and these might change when a new space is entered or the meaning ofthe space itselfchanges. This "en­ dowed space" motivates both abstract pointing-the pointing finger aimed at a concept-and an axial division ofspace into different roles or meanings. The first example here shows this axial division where two slices ofspace represent two roles in the story.

SPLITTING THE GESTURE SPACE . My illustration comes from another ofthe full-length film narratives. The speaker was setting up a new scene (the characters had already appeared in earlier scenes), and said:3 "she

The linguistic references to the two characters are thoroughly interleaved. However, gesturally, the refer­ ences were separated into two spaces (only the utterances accompanied by gestures are represented) :

(6.39)�_ _
Center Space (malr; character)
then what he does is he steadies her hand and he gets her a drink and 0 starts to play the piano

Right Space (female character) she picks up a palette and 0 attempts to do a paint­ lllg
then she signs the painting

Speech and gesture are coexpressive in this passage in two ways. The linguistic forms referring to the two characters show a progression from more explicit to less explicit, and this progression is defined separately for each space. Moreover, entering or reentering a particular space was the occasion for upping the explicitness ofthe referring form.
In the female character's space, the references are, successivel)� "she"0-"she." The first pronoun declines to a zero, thus a relatively more ex­ plicit referring form is followed by a less explicit one. These were succes­
sive references within the same space, with the male character's space not intervening. The zero subject then was followed by "she," an increase of explicitness, and this was because the male character's space had inter­ vened.
Similarly with references in the male character's space. The sequence was: "then what he does is"-"he"-0, that is, a steady decline of ex­ plicitness. The overmarked reference, "then what he does is," in which the referring form gets its own clause, creates a major discontinuity at the first mention of the male character and the first time his space was used (cf. Levy 1984). This was just after a double use ofthe female character's space. The speaker was thus introducing the spatial dichotomy as well as the male character. The highly explicit marking of the referring form, which at first seems so excessive, in fact was appropriate for coex-

pressivity with the gesture. The rest ofthe references to the male charac­ ter followed a steady decline within his space and are quite orderly in expressing, with gesture, the continuation ofthe artist's space.

ABSTRACT POINTING . C oncrete pointing in a narrative uses space icon­ ically. The left-right, up-down axes are homologous to the equivalent axes of the space occupied by events of the story. An example of such a referential use ofpointing is this:

(6.40) and [throws him off] the window sill Pointing: right handpoints to lower rightspace.

The gesture depicts the trajectory and final destination of the character. The path and destination iconically represent the layout in the cartoon itself.
Pointing also has an abstract function in narratives, and it is this kind ofpointing-abstract pointing-that we will focus on. This is a gesture where the speaker appears to be pointing at empty space, but in fact the space is not empty; it is full of conceptual significance. Such abstract deixis implies a metaphoric use ofspace in which concepts are given spa­ tial form, and this space can be indexed by pointing. The objects are not actually present, but the compulsion to point at their space remains. In the following two examples, the speaker is at a point of transition in his narrative and is introducing a new character and new development in the plot:

(6.41) and in fact a few minutes laterwe see [the artist]
Pointing: right handpoints to leftside ofspace.
The gesture was synchronous with mentioning the artist for the first time. Orienting to the artistwas paramount. This character is referred to again in the following clause and there is again a pointing gesture indicat­ ing the same space, but now the gesture is timed with the reference to an action. The space has been revalued andindexed as the space ofthe scene itself. These abstract uses ofpointing perform major discourse functions (chap. 7).
(6.42) and uh she [looks over] Frank's shoulder at him
Points to left side ofspace again.

SHIFTS OF ORIGO . Thus far we have defined pointing in terms of the target of pointing. Pointing, however, is more complex. It is inherently orientational. The speaker orients toward a target and a region ofspace.

1 74

Varieties of Gesture

A pointing finger iconically depicts a line that runs from an "origo" to the target (the term "origo" is from Buhler 1934; also see Jarvella and Klein
1982). A pointing gesture is thus complicated, it consists ofthree parts :

Origo --i> Referent Object

where the gesture proper depicts the line that connects the origo to the target. The origo implied in the gesture can be identified by tracing back the line to its starting point; this is not always the speaker himself. For example, in the following, from a conversation, a speaker contrasts two kinds of pointing, the first with an origo not at himself, the second with the origo shifted to his own locus, and these correspond to an attempt to shift the thematic content ofthe conversation (fig. 6. 18 and 6. 19) :

Figure 6.18. Pointing gesture with origo not at selfwith "did you [go toJ school [thereJ or uh?" The speaker is orienting the listener to the listener's space for "there," and this favors the origo to the side. (Compare with fig. 6. 19.)
Figure 6. 19. Pointing gesture with origo at self with "oh an' you went to undergraduate [hereJ ?" The "here" in question is where the speaker is located. The speaker is orienting himselfto the space and the origo shifts to reflect this. (Compare with fig. 6.18.)

(6.43) did you [go to] school [there] or uh? Points with an origo offto the side: orientingfrom someplace other than self (6.44) (Interlocutor: I did go to school there, I went to school here also, um so I came back kind on wa-) (6.45) oh an' you went to undergraduate [here] or? Points but with origo now atself: orientingfrom self

The gesture at (6.43) had an origo not at the speaker and implied that the speaker was establishing someone, not himself as the origin of the space for "there." The gesture at (6.45), when the origo swung to himself, im­ plied that he was now orienting for himself. This self-origo was in fact the
first to be used by this spealcer. The preceding pointing gestures, in­ cluding the one in (6.43), had origos not at himself. The complete mean­ ing of (6.43) thus seems to have been: in relation to you, did you go to school "there?" In contrast, the meaning of(6.45) was: in relation to me, did you go to school "here." The first space left it open to the listener to define "there," but the second space could only be a "here" defined by the speaker. These examples are from the cat-and-mouse interaction that I presented in chapter 4 to illustrate gestural mind reading. The speaker of (6.43) and (6.45) was attempting to find out where the listener had gone to school, and the listener had merely said, "at Chicago." The new origo at (6.45) can be seen as part of the spealcer's attempt to pin down the listener. By insisting on his own person as the origo, he could exclude the ambiguous reference to Chicago that had been the listener's way of avoiding disclosure. The gesture at (6.45) could only be the University of Chicago, while the gesture at (6.43) and earlier could have been any­ where the listener imagined himself to be. The word selection, "under­ graduate," in (6.45) had the same effect ofexcluding the city meaning as the referent of "here," since only a university has undergraduates. Thus the origo shift and the word choice (through its implications) were the coexpressive elements in this situation.

Gesture Repetitions
Sometimes gestures are repeated but rarely is the second gesture an exact repetition ofthe first. Ifa contrast is implied, the second gesture may be enhanced. The enhancement conveys the contrast. On the other hand, if a gesture is repeated without an implied contrast the second gesture is usually a diminished version ofthe first. The diminution conveys the lack ofcontrast. Thus we have two opposite situations, gesture enhancement (for contrast) and gesture diminution (for lack ofcontrast). The follow­ ing are two illustrative examples .

1 76

Varieties of Gesture

ENHANCEMENT. The contrast is between uses of space on two levels. The first gesture is pointing that sets up a locus in the narration itself ("that's my father's newsstand"). The second gesture is also pointing but now it sets up a repair ofthe speaker's own speech ("not newsstand, news SHOP"). The values of the spaces are quite different-one part of the story line, the other part of the speaker's own discourse-and this con­ trast is marked with enhancement (forward movement is added) (see fig. 6.20) :

(with the word "whatever") and doesn't bring in contrasting informa­ tion (see fig. 6.21), and the second gesture is about halfthe physical size ofthe first.

(6.48) oh and then you see him trying to get into the apartment again over some wires and [it's the the trolley car . . . ] Iconic: shows moving trolley connector (fig. 6.21a) .
(6.49) [wires whatever] Iconic: repeats showing the connector, but much smaller (fig. 6.21 b).

Figure 6.20. Gestural enhancement ofmeaning. Panel (a) shows the gesture with "that's [my father's news]stand"; this sets up the news stand in the left space. Panel (b) shows the enhanced point with the correction, "not [newsstand] [news SHOP] ." The pointing indi­ cates a further space on the left and marks the difference between referring to the news stand (first gesture) and referring on a metalinguistic or metapragmatic level to the speaker's own discourse (the point).

(6.46) that's [my father's news]stand (1)

(1) Deictic: hand swings to left.

(6.47) not [newsstand] [news SHOP]

(2)

(3)

(2) Deictic: handswingsforward and to right. (3) Deictic: handswingsforward and left. The gesture at' ( 1 ) is to the left; that at (2) is to the right (contrast of negation) ; the one at (3) is the enhancement and conveys the speaker's metalinguistic repair.

DIMINUTION. The following example again includes a metalinguistic comment, but in this case the comment belittles the concurrent utterance

Figure 6.21 . Gestural diminution ofmeaning. Panel (a) shows an ico­ nic gesture with "over some wires and [it's the the trolley car . . . ] . Panel (b) is a reduced repetition with "[wires whatever]." The dis­ paragement of the word choice "wires" by "whatever" is conveyed in the diminution.
CONTINUATION. A different type ofgesture repetition is the following. In this case, the same iconic handshape is maintained throughout a series of descriptive statements, each of which occurred with its own gesture performed with the other hand. The maintained handshape created a cohesive link uniting all the statements and other gestures. At the end of the string of statements, the speaker referred to the entity that had been depicted all along in the continued gesture, andutilized for this a definite referring noun phrase (implying that the entity was an established refer­ ent; Chafe 1976).
The speaker was describing a scene in the movie in which a character is shown lying in bed holding a newspaper. The narrator's left hand per­ forms a gesture for holding the newspaper, and this was preserved throughout the description. Simultaneously, the right hand performed a series ofdifferent gestures for the successive clauses:
(6.50) he's [in his bed]
Iconic: holding the ((newspaper) with his left hand.
(6. 5 1 ) and he can see [the door]
Iconic: holding the ((newspaper) with his left hand. Points to right with right hand.

Iconic: holding the « newspapeY) with his left hand. Points tofront with right hand. (6.53) he just [sees him] in the mirror

(6.54) and uh he's [trying]
Iconic: both hands hold the «newspaper.))
(6.55) [to put down the paper slowly] Iconic: both hands slowly move the «newspapeY) downward.

The narrator refers to the newspaper verbally for the first time only in (6.55), but the reference is made with a definite noun phrase, "the pa­ per," not "a paper." To the speaker, the newspaper was an established, recoverable object in the scene and he presents it as such to the listener
(cf Chafe 1974, 1976); The newspaper in fact had been present in the scene all along, but only as an image, not as a verbally designated entity, and this image was enough to bring out definite reference to it.

SELF-GENERATION OF OPPOSITIONS THROUGH REPETITION. The forward movement of the hand with "news SHOP" conveyed nothing about news shops or the location of the news shop in relation to the newsstand (since theywere one and the same thing) ; it conveyed only the existence ofa contrast between two levels ofmeaning. The "newsstand" of (6.41 ) was normal language, referring to something in the story, whereas the "news SHOP" of (6.47) was metalanguage, referring to lan­ guage itself (in fact, to (6.46) ). Many metaphoric gestures can be seen to form chains in this way in which mini-systems of opposition briefly emerge. The diminution in (6.49) contrasted on the parameter ofextent ofmovement, and this also had no iconic significance; the content ofthe diminution was coexpressive with the spoken form "whatever." These mini-systems are not structures derived from the spoken language, but temporary structures, good only as long as these specific contrasts are at the forefront ofthe speaker's thoughts (see chap. 9).

Conclusions
Metaphors, including metaphoric gestures, provide us with the power to think of the abstract in concrete terms-in images of space, form, and movement that are not just concrete images but that become abstract

concepts. Many psychological studies have demonstrated the efficiency ofhuman thought in concrete contexts, and conversely, the striking lack ofefficiency ofthought forced to deal with abstract modes ofrepresenta­ tion such as the symbols of formal logic ( Johnson-Laird 1983). Meta­ phoricimages thus can be said to play a crucial role in the effectiveness of human thought; and gesture images, because they are ubiquitous and readily available, can be claimed to play this crucial role with great fre­ quency. This fact explains why metaphoric gestures are such a common accompaniment of speech in narrations and conversations and why ap­ parently all cultures provide schematas for constructing homologies be­ tween abstract content and concrete imagery. Metaphoric images are the culture's way ofinfluencing individuals' thought. Society cannot directly control thinking, but it does influence it by providing schemata for creat­ ing metaphoric images.
What can we conclude about the metaphoric process itself1 The crea­ tion ofhomologies depends on an ability to consider space, movement,
etc., in a new light. It is not just space, movement, etc., but these qualities imbued with abstract content. The important thing about metaphoric imagery is that it is simultaneously concrete and abstract, and this is what the efficiency ofthought requires. There is therefore a meta-level capacity inherentin metaphoric thinking. Philosophers such as Max Black (1982) and I. A. Richards ( 1936) have emphasized the "interanimation" ofthe Topic and Vehicle; the psychologists Glucksberg and Keysar ( 1990) em­ phasize the formation ofnew categories by combining the Topic with the Vehicle. But, in addition, the Vehicle is used for conveying, not just an image, but an image felt to be homologous with abstract content. This image is the abstract thought. The meta-level process indeed forms a new category, as Glucksberg and Keysar maintain, and depends on inter­ animation, as Black and Richards proposed, but it also reveals a capacity to think about one thing in two ways. Without this capacity, we would be confined to concrete levels ofthought or to assaults on the abstract that are painfully inefficient and prone to error. Young children in fact do seem to have a limited capacity to adopt meta-level perspectives, even though they are not limited in their ability to see the world in terms of novel or fanciful imagery. The almost total absence of metaphoric ges­ tures in children until a late stage of development thus emphasizes the importance ofmeta-level thinking in the creation of gestures ofthe ab­ stract (see chap. 1 1).

Gestures and Discourse

At the gesticulation end of Kendon's continuum gestures differ from sign languages precisely in that they are not constrained by codes. Lan­ guages (including sign languages) provide certain conventional pack­ ages ofmeaning that speakers cannot avoid. It is often the case that ifwe mark one feature, the code forces us to mark another feature whether we intend to or not. But since gestures are not constrained by language­ like conventions, the gesture needs to mark only those features that are relevant and is free to leave other features unspecified. This expressive freedom implicit in gestures is most apparent when gestures express pragmatic content. English is a language particularly weak in systems for marking the structure ofdiscourse. Swahili, for instance, has specific par­ ticles, "ka" and "ki," that indicate whether a statement belongs to the main story line or to the subsidiary background (Hopper 1979). English has no equivalent devices for drawing this distinction, nor for marking many other pragmatic distinctions. However, gestures, unconstrained by a code, are free to express pragmatic content.
My purpose in this chapter is to to examine the relationship of ges­ tures to ongoing, real-time storytelling. The method of collecting ges­ tures during cartoon and filmnarrationsmakesthis examination feasible. The original purpose of the method was to have a standard situation in which to study gesture performance, but now we can reverse direction and use gestures to study narratives. I will argue the following: that ges­ tures reflect the discourse functions ofthe sentences they co-occur with. Thus, gestures can be used to studythis discourse, andhow the speaker is construing the discourse structure as he or she proceeds through the nar­ rative. Very often a gesture reflects a discourse function while the sen­ tence does not, or does not clearly enough for an onlooker to notice it without having the function revealed in the gesture first. Thus, gestures show something about the process of narration that would be missed if only the speech channel were regarded as the vehicle ofnarrative.
Moreover, while gestures refer to discourse structure they also are in­ tegral parts of the utterances they appear with. From this we can infer that utterances themselves include references to discourse as an integral part oftheir being. Even though the linguistic code does not enable the speaker to express these references in words, the gesture channel does ex­ press them. A speaker creates his own context through discourse but he

also includes in each utterance a reference to the discourse, and this refer­
ence may be at the forefront. The kinds of discourse relationships that gestures reveal include suc­
cession, voice, point of view, distance, and level; also, they reveal the property called "communicative dynamism"-the property whereby ut­ terances push the communication forward (Firbas 1964, 1971). Such discourse references are built into utterances as fundamental properties shown, first and foremost, in the gesture channel ofthe utterance.
I have organized this chapter into three main parts plus a conclusion. Thefirstpart analyzes thestructure ofnarrative discourse. The second deals with thefUnctions ofgestures in narration and how the different kinds of gesture specialize in different levels. The third looks at communicative dy­ namism and how discontinuity in discourse determines when gestures occur and the degree of elaboration they receive.

Structure of Narrative
Introduction
To explain the discourse shaping ofgesture types, it is necessary to have a general theoretical picture of narrative structure as such. The different kinds of gesture can be shown to favor one part of this structure over others. The following is one such theoretical picture. 1
"Storytelling" or "narrating" refers to the entire set of events that make up the conveying ofa story by one person to another. Each ofthese events may be referred to by the storyteller, and this provides a way of tracking the narrative structure as it is built up on multiple levels for all the parties concerned.
Storytelling is not just a succession of events or episodes, one after another. It is structured on multiple levels, with subtle shifts oftime and space, perspective, distance between narrator and narrated, and integra­ tion ofthe sequential with the nonsequential-these are its fundamental dimensions. Gestures track these dimensions. From one gesture to the next, depicted imagery is partially the same and is partially changed: the changes become the highlighted oppositions in the structure of the nar­ rative, strengthening our understanding of the parallels and repetitions that make up the "poetics" ofthe narrative (cf. Silverstein 1984). Narra­ tive language is thus not a two-dimensional affair with only intersecting

syntagmatic and paradigmatic axes: it has a full, rounded, three-dimen­ sional structure, one dimension of which is imagistic (both visual and kinesic, and either holistic or analytic). Many of the parameters of the
basic structure of literary art are conveyed in gesture in spontaneous
storytelling. The context ofthe narrative may be conceived ofas a set ofinterlock­
ing "participation frameworks" (Hanks 1991) or "mental spaces" (Fauconnier 1985), where actors participate in a given act. One impor­ tant frame is viewing the cartoon or film. The "actors" in this frame are the narrator and the TV screen. Another frame is the telling ofthe story, and the actors are the narrator and the listener. A third frame-generally more complex-is the world ofthe story itself, in which, for example, a woman retrieves a note from her handbag and surreptitiously reads it.
Theunits ofthis participation framework are represented events, any one ofwhich may be selected and referred to by the narrator.
References can be defined in all ofthese frameworks on several levels. Stories generally refer to incidents or occurrences that follow one an­
other in the real or fictive world (e.g., a character climbs up a drainpipe to reach an upper story). In addition, narratives recounting cartoons or films also contain references to the event of observing the visual text it­ self, the film or cartoon story ("it was a Sylvester andTweety cartoon," or "it didn't start out a talkie, it started out just music in the background"), and/or to the event of the storytelling ("I'm going to tell you about a cartoon I just saw"). References to these "metanarrative events" and "paranarrative events" often act to indicate junctures between the parts ofa story. This narrativestructure is provided on the verbal and the non­ verbal levels, but is often more apparent on the nonverbal level.

Narrative) Metanarrative) and Paranarrative Levels
THE NARRATIVE LEVEL. This consists ofreferences to events from the world ofthe story proper. The defining characteristic ofsentences at this level is that the listener takes them to be a faithful simulacrum of world occurrences in their actual order. This temporal constraint is what deter­ mines the narrative level (Labov and Waletsky 1967; Hopper 1979; Hopper and Thompson 1 980). Thus, the narrative level must be some­ how distinguished, so that the listener will understand that the order in which the sentences on this level appear is itselfpart ofthe story. Film and cartoon narrations invariably have a story line in which events occur in a certain order, and thus the narrative level is at the core of the narrators' concern in recounting the stimulus. Gestures play a crucial part in mark­
ing sentences whose order is a simulacrum ofthe story line.

1 86

Theory

THE METANARRATIVE LEVEL. Not only do narrators tell the story plot line, but they also may make explicit references to the structure of the story as they build it up. Clauses presenting the s�ory about the story �re interwoven with the narrative level and constitute the metanarratlve level. Unlike narrative clauses, metanarrative clauses are unconstrained by the order of events in the real or fi�tive world. It is p�ecisely for this reason that it is crucial to mark narrative and metanarratlve clauses; one kind is a simulacrum ofthe world order, the other kind is not. Any refer­ ence to metanarrative events requires the ability to manipulate the story as a unit and to objectify it, and to comment on the story as an event in
itself.

THE PARANARRATIVE LEVEL. Storytellers also make references to their

own experience of observing the film or cartoo? and/or to the event of

storytelling itself; this introduces the paranarratIve level. At the paranar­

rative level, narrators step out ofthe official narrator role; they speak for

themselves, as their own personality, and their emphasis is on the rela­

tionship of narrator to following excerpt from

Event Lines

The sequence ofevents that comprises the story proper is only one of a number ofsequences ofeventsthatcomprisethetotalnarrative. The sort of storytelling that appears in our studies is composed of five "event lines."2 These make up the three narrative levels. The concept ofan event line gives us a way ofanalyzing the ongoing discourse from the vantage point ofeach individual sentence. The narrator ofa film or cartoon story does not fill the role ofnarrator throughout the storytelling process. The

"narrator"is atfirst a viewer, lookingat aTVscreenonwhichis displayed the visual text-the representation in images of a particular story. After
first receiving the narration, the recipient then becomes the supplier of a

narration, tellingthe story to someonewhohasneverseen the cartoon or movie. Any given sentence may include a reference to one ofthese event lines, and this reference places the sentence on the corresponding narra­

tive level. The events lines that we can identify in cartoon and film narra­ tives are the following:
1. First there is the sequence ofevents in the story. References to this event line dominate the narrative level. In the cartoon, a character climb­

ing up the pipe to a window is preceded by the two simultaneous events of this character looking at a second character through binoculars, and the second character looking at the first character through binoculars.
2. This story is made available byway ofa visual textwhich is the car­

toon or film. In pipe is preceded

bthyethcaarttoofotnhethseeceovnedntchoafroancteerchl�aorakcintegrtchlirmoubgin�gbuinpocthue­

lars which is preceded by the first character looking through bmoculars.

References to this event line appear in the metanarrative level. 3. The viewing ofthe cartoon also has its own temporal sequence of
actions: first the personwatches the TV screen, and then sees the charac­ ter with binoculars in his paws. This event line also appears at the meta­

narrative level. 4. The person watching the cartoon forms a representation in mem­
ory of the visual text that is more or less complete with respect to the sequence of events depicted in the visual text. And this event line also occupies the metanarrative level.
5. Finally, there is the sequence ofrecounting the cartoon to a listener: theinterpersonalnarrative. Atthispointtheviewerbecomes aspeakerand may say, "Itwas a cat and bird cartoon-youknowthe kind." R�ferences to these kinds of interpersonal events occur on the paranarratlve level.

2. An insight due to Michael Silverstein.

188

Theory

These narrative event lines are important because all of them may equally well form the subject ofthe narrative that the listener hears. That is, not only the events ofcharacter 1 chasing character 2 are conveyed in a narrative, but also the events of watching the cartoon and then describ­ ing it. The event sequence ofthe story plot (1) is the narrative level ofthe discourse. The visual text event line (2), the viewing line (3), and the rep­ resentation line (4) form the metanarrative level ofthe discourse: the part ofthe narrative that is about narrating. The interpersonalevent line (5) is what we are referring to as the paranarrative level of the discourse: the part ofthe storywhere the narrator steps out and speaks in his or her own voice to the listener.
Given all of this, it is not enough to say that the order of the story
follows the order ofevents unless we also specify which narrative events are being referred to, and the level of the discourse on which the refer­ ence is made (narrative, metanarrative, paranarrative). In speech there is rarely a clear-cut distinction between reference to a character's actions, and references to the narrator's own actions. The same linguistic devices perform both functions. In gesture, however, distinctions are drawn be­ tween these levels ofthe narrative. Likewise, distinctions are drawn be­ tween the point ofview ofthe narrator andthat ofthe characters (Cassell and McNeill, to appear).

Function of Gestures in Narrative
Differentkinds ofgesture appear depending on where in the narratologi­ cal structure the speaker is operating at any given moment. These gestures thus embody specific information about the discourse structure. The ma­ jor associations ofgestures and narratological structures are summarized in figure 7. 1 .
The chart shows the gesture situation reached by traversing the differ­ ent combinations of narratological features. Note that there are missing combinations, e.g., there are no iconics and no perspectives at the meta­ narrative or paranarrative levels. However, there are different voices throughout the chart: a character, an observer, the narrator as a nar­ ratively created role, or the narrator as participant in the experimental situation. Thus the different gesture occurrences are genuinely distinc­ tive additions to the narrative structure, and by tracking them, along with speech, we can uncover the narrative structure exactly as it is being unfolded in real time.
Formally speaking, the gestures at the different nodes offigure 7. 1 are nicely adapted to the pragmatic functions being performed there. Iconics

appear at the narrative level, where the content consists of emplotted story events; iconic gestures exhibit these events. Metaphorics appear at the metanarrative level, where the content consists ofthe story structure itselfviewed as an object or space; metaphoric gestures present the story as an object or an arrangement in space. Pointing appears at all levels when orientation or change oforientation is the focal content; pointing conveys a relationship of an origo to the gesture space. Finally, beats ap­ pear when there are rapid shifts oflevel; beats indicate the temporal locus ofthe shifts without having to convey the content on either ofthe levels involved.
In this section, as in Cassell and McNeill (1990, to appear), I discuss the relationship between speech and gesture in terms of the diagram in figure 7. 1 . The gesture categories and relationships already introduced in previous chapters will be related to the storytelling relationships sum­ marized in that structure. I will concentrate on how gestures mark the variouselements ofa story: that is, how gestures participate in the depic­ tion of action, person, space, and time (narrative events) ; and also how gestures participate in the articulation of the discourse (metanarrative and paranarrative events) : that is, the role of gestures in narrative phe­ nomena such as voice, perspective, order, etc., that take a given set of abstract story components and realize them in a particular way in a par­ ticular story.
