PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION
There are certain activities in our lives that seem to be endlessly repeating themselves: we witness an apparently endless construction of houses, office buildings, roads and highways, and other infrastructures; there is the preparation and consumption of foodstuffs; there is the daily maintenance of the quarters we live in; there are the recurrent activities governing our use of the markets, small and big; and so on and so forth.
Similarly, writing articles and essays may, for some people, seem to have the same repetitive and perhaps even monotonous character. Still, there is a difference. Writing (or for that matter, all communicative action) is always directed at a person or group of persons; even the most monologic self-expressing poetry always addresses somebody (even though, in extreme cases, the audience is restricted to the poet him-or herself). In addition, the repetitive character of, say, housework may prompt our easy-going consorts to protest against the making of beds or the cleaning of kitchens, with the motivation that ‘beds have to be made again anyway, so why not just let them be’, or: ‘dust is going to happen, so why not just adjust ourselves to a lower than needy standard of cleanliness’. In contrast, activities having to do with communication (in particular, writing) do not only affect the author (the ‘originator’, or auctor, with an old-fashioned term), but also, and perhaps to an even higher degree, the ‘end user’: the recipient, in our case, the reader.
But, some reader might object, what has all this to do with the current (concise) encyclopedia of language and linguistics that I am looking at right now? The answer is that encyclopedias, like all works of letters, presuppose our cooperation as readers. In and through the act of reading, we align ourselves with the author whose text we are perusing and with whom we are cooperating. And even though encyclopedias may seem to embody just what the word means: an all-round paideia (which is the Greek word for ‘upbringing’), to a cursory observer it may seem that such works only pretend to satisfy an individual’s desire to know a factoid or two, or to delve a little deeper into a certain area of knowledge. What is often overlooked is the interactive feature that is built into the very essence of encyclopedic work, no matter how apparently passive in character on the part of the reader.
It is no secret that many encyclopedias have been the forerunners of revolutions, as I pointed out in the Preface to the first edition of this Concise Encyclopedia. And what I wrote back in 1998 is just as true today as it was then:
The purpose of an Encyclopedia, according to the original (1750–1769) encyclope´distes, the French literates and philosophers Denis Diderot and Jean le Rond d’Alembert, is to enlighten the population in order to make them choose the right way of leading their lives, free from the encumbrances of false beliefs and authoritarian doctrines. This apparent innocent and worthy aim had much wider and more profound consequences for society than its proposers could ever have foreseen, as we now know, with the benefit of historical hindsight. Two hundred years after the American, the French, and countless other revolutions, the encyclopedia has become a standard household fixture, and it is hard to imagine, by looking at the impressive, often leather-bound volumes that adorn the bookshelves of better-off households around the planet, how the original ideals of democratizing enlightenment could have had such strong political, even revolutionary side effects. (Mey 1998:xxv)
By the double token of being iterative and revolutionary, encyclopedias, while pretending to codify the knowledge they conserve and propagate, also reflect the societal interaction that is at their base. And this is, finally, why encyclopedias have to be constantly updated and ‘re-cycled’.

vi Preface to the second edition
The British author Patrick Leigh Fermor describes, in one of his erudite ‘travelogues’, how he, as a young man roaming across the old Hapsburg domain, always found solace in the encyclopedias he discovered in the libraries of the manors and castles to which influential friends had given him introductions. Thus, the traveler found himself ‘‘poring over Meyers Konversationslexikon’’ during his stay at a castle in Rumania, while trying to update his knowledge of Central European history (Hungarian and Transylvanian in particular; Leigh Fermor 2005: 101)—in more or less the same way that I, in an earlier period of my life and some twenty years later, helped by Meyer, familiarized myself with the beautiful railway stations and city halls that had once adorned cities like Metz and Strasbourg in what had been the (then) German Reichsland Elsass-Lothringen. I recall the historic frisson I experienced, due in part to the fact that many of those magnificent building had long since fallen prey to the combined forces of war and regressive architectural ideologies, posing as progressive notions.
The ‘melancholy of art’, melanconia dell’arte, that I perceived contrasted with the urgent need to move on with history, in the same way as it happened for the English author years ago, during a journey through a landscape that was in continuous flux, always on the brink of disappearing into the local and historical horizon, only experienced by ‘being there’, in real life or in the vicarious existence of an encyclopedia, and by moving ahead in an irreversible, and in a way perverse, penetration.
As far as pragmatics is concerned, such a journey provides us with an apt metaphor, both with regard to the landscape traveled and to the various intellectual landmarks and influences encountered there. It seems safe to say that the pragmatic landscape is not only in flux, but that its movements and tendencies have steadily accelerated their courses. Thus, from a humble beginning at the remote outposts of philosophy and linguistic semantics, pragmatics has developed into a vast realm where often conflicting theories and practices reign—just as it was the case for our Brit, traveling the always unruly and undefinable territories that at one time were loosely integrated components of the Austrian-Hungarian kaiserliche und ko¨ nigliche twin monarchy, the ‘‘k.u.k. Doppelmonarchie’’, from the years before the Great War. But also, just as it is not only interesting, but useful for us to learn about happenings in those parts in the twilight between the two world wars, and confront them with the situation as it has evolved and especially as it is present to our minds today, so too is it useful, nay necessary, for us to reflect on the developments of our discipline ever since the days of John L. Austin and his burgeoning speech act theory. And in this respect, the new (second, 2006) edition of the mother volume to the present work, the Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics along with its present, concise offshoot, seem to be timely undertakings.
If one were to ask what in particular has changed since those early times, the answer may be that pragmatics has become a ‘discipline’ in its own right, rather than a somewhat ill-defined by-product of other branches of language studies. The notorious ‘wastebasket of semantics’ comes to mind: an expression due to Yehoshua BarHillel, who considered pragmatics more or less as uncharted territory, a bit like those Western expanses in America where a man still could do whatever he wanted to do and get away with it, as no rules or regulations had yet been invented to provide law-based security and establish rule-driven well-formedness. In contrast, we observe a trend towards what could be called a ‘legalization’ of pragmatics, starting in its earlier development and continuing until the present day. Even though it still is too early to speak of a unified scientific discipline (a term which may more properly be applied to other branches of linguistics, such as phonetics or syntax), there is no doubt that pragmatics, as a discipline, has come into its own.
It would be wrong, however, to consider the growth and deployment of pragmatics as a science uniquely as a ‘breaking away’ from older disciplines like semantics or syntax. Rather, the development that led to the rise of pragmatics started as a linguistics-internal movement (inspired by the philosophy of language of the Austinian type), whose ultimate endpoint could not be foreseen (and, as many will say, is still out of sight and reach). Whereas, on the one hand, certain developments in pragmatics may have been triggered by the descriptive aporias and insufficiencies involved in purely semantic or even syntactic ways of considering language, on the other it is equally true that many modern pragmaticists gathered their inspiration from outside the realm of linguistics proper.
The two streams in this development: an ‘intralinguistic’ one, dealing with descriptive and explanatory questions from a linguistics-internal point of view, and an ‘extralinguistic’ one, emphasizing the social character of the language user and the language used, while insisting on the use of language as a defining feature of pragmatics, often seemed to be on a collision course, yet at other times were able to negotiate a peaceful coexistence. In particular, when one looks at some of the recent developments in pragmatics (some of which the present encyclopedia has only just begun to chart), it becomes clear that the two streams, or tendencies, have much to tell one another. Not only does the ‘purely’ syntactic or semantic approach not suffice, when we are

dealing with typical pragmatic phenomena (such as the manipulative or rhetorical uses of language that ever since the Sophists have been the hallmark of a pragmatically oriented study of language); in addition, the internal contradictions that arose from the desire to create a unified matrix, valid for semantic as well as syntactic description (as, e.g., exemplified in ‘Montague grammar’) have led to the acceptance of what some have called a ‘pragmatic intrusion’ into semantics (cf., among others, Levinson 2000: 164 et pass.).
For many, the very idea that rules could be given for pragmatic use of language has from the beginning been a non sequitur: the creative use of language by the individual in a societal environment could only be circumscribed by the classical, individual-based methods of linguistics, not defined (Mey 2002: 183). Instead, pragmatics has from its very inception promoted the development of society-oriented approaches, that is, approaches that take their point of departure in what is or can be out there, in the social context surrounding us, and then intrapolate these realities and possibilities onto the actual situation in which the language user himor herself is involved. Such approaches contrast starkly with the well-known efforts by theoretical linguists, traditional sociolinguists, and other social scientists to first define the ‘said’, and then try to figure out what the conditions are that make a particular utterance ‘correct’ or ‘acceptable’.
In all these cases, there is a certain ‘ecological’ principle at work, by which users endeavor to maximize their results with minimal efforts, while respecting their linguistic and social environments. This ‘ecological turn’ has inspired such differing tendencies as, on the one hand, relevance theory, and by what has been called ‘default semantics’ on the other (cf. Jaszczolt 2005 and the article by that name in this volume). Similarly, we have been witness to the rise of ‘optimality theory’ in its various versions—this latter approach is still in its infancy and has not yet reached acceptance in most of the ‘border territories’ (even so, the present work does have an article outlining some notions and possible approaches, cf. the eponymous article presented in the body of this volume).
Other recent developments have resulted in psycholinguistic excursus (or should I say: ‘excursions’, to remain in the traveling metaphor?). Here, one finds a number of articles dealing with developmental aspects of pragmatics (the psycholinguistic view) or approaches that are oriented towards cognitive psychology (as in ‘cognitive pragmatics’). More generally, the cognitive approach itself, originally considered as an extension of epistemic and psychological ways of looking at language use, has come into its own as well, leading to a whole flurry of writings on venerable notions such as metaphor and metonymy, not to forget the return to ‘classical’, speech act-based ideas—first of all the concept of the speech act itself and its conditions, injecting them with new interpretations of the time-honored Searlean and Austinian conditions and restrictive maxims, including further extended notions, such as that of ‘flouting a maxim’ (on which see the article of that name, this volume).
The idea that language belongs, not only to a particular culture or country, but also to the speakers themselves, has gained some momentum in the past decades. Thus, the understanding that not everything linguistic is accessible to everybody at all times, and neither to everybody in the same (legally sanctioned) fashion, has given rise to speculations about accessibility in language, and to what has been called ‘territory of information’; see, e.g., the article on ‘accessibility theory’ in this volume, or the writings of Akio Kamio (1994, 1995, 1997) and recent work by John Heritage (2007). To express one’s condolences, for instance (to take Heritage’s example), presupposes that one has the correct ‘stance’ in regard to the ‘condolee’. More generally, all speech acting on principle belongs to society, and is only derivatively made possible through the language user’s active participation in that society—ideas that have been around ever since the eighties (see Mey 1985), and which have lately come to fruition in my theory of ‘pragmatic acts’ (on which see the article of that name in the current volume; compare also Mey 2008).
The idea that language use and linguistic activities in general (either in the phonetic, syntactic, semantic, or pragmatic realm) obey some kind of ‘law of least effort’ has been fruitfully mined not only by the protagonists of relevance theory, but also in a more general way by the defenders of optimal, rather than maximal, solutions to linguistic problems. What this means is that rather than abiding by some strict rules (like those that allow one to say ‘yes’ or ‘no’ to questions of grammaticality), the thought that an optimal solution often consists in accepting a certain deviation from strict standards has taken hold in the sciences of the human over the past decades.
Early on, the psychologists started to operate with a notion of ‘prototype’, meaning: a concept with fuzzy edges all around; and in pragmatics, the suggestion that conditions are more optimally construed as constraints on the environment than as production rules binding the individual user, has gained considerable popularity. While a fully fledged theory of ‘optimality’ is something that we will have to wait (and work) for (as I remarked above), we may observe, at the interfaces between pragmatics and the other linguistic areas, an ever growing trend towards voluntary collaboration, rather than towards unification under some stringent formal umbrella. Given the newness of such approaches, there are only a few articles in the present volume that reflect this

viii Preface to the second edition
tendency; had there been more time, and had the selection process been less restricted (viz., practically to the original articles in the fourteen mother volumes of 2006), more current work might have been made available.
One issue still bothers the compiler of the present volume, as it did with regard to its 1998 predecessor. It is an issue familiar to all who have ever tried to produce a conspectus-type, work-oriented overview of some area of knowledge. The dilemma of choosing between an alphabetical sequencing of contributions versus an hierarchical, thematically-based division of the field has bothered dictionary and encyclopedia makers for as long as their works have been around. The great encyclope´distes of the 18th century, whom I quoted earlier, opted for a strict alphabetical order; while I am not privy to their motivations, I can imagine that ease of access must have been one of them.
One is reminded of the often occurring situation where an opportunistic, ‘seniority’-based order wins out over a logical one for the simple reason that logics are not universal. Compare the nightmare of those medieval philosophers who tried to capture the whole world under one metaphysical hat; closer to home, one needs only to think of the familiar situation where keys and other important items become practically impossible to find because the owner (often identical with the original depositor) no longer is certain which logic has guided his or her movements while putting away the object in question. Most techniques of object (and knowledge) retrieval operate by a logic of local associations: where did I go first, where from there, and so on. The alphabet provides us with an easy to remember, neutral sequence where everything has its place in a mostly universally accepted order; and this logic is what I have decided to follow also in the present volume.
It has been said by the famous Dr. Samuel Johnson (whose doctoral dignity seems to have been more honorific than acquired by hard work) that ‘‘dictionaries are like watches: the worst is better than none and the best cannot be expected to go quite true’’ (in Mrs. Piozzi’s Anecdotes of the Late Samuel Johnson). Applying this dictum to the present work and its generic characteristics, one could say that encyclopedias, despite their recognized usefulness, never will achieve the mandate that is inherent in their title, viz. to give a full conspectus of an entire discipline or area of knowledge, let alone of the human knowledge in toto.
But even a more modest effort, as represented by the present, concise work, may be useful in giving us the time of day in more than one sense: not just telling us what is going on, but discuss it (through the voices of the articles’ authors) in an intelligent and accessible fashion. If this should happen in the case of the present work, its compiler may have escaped the common doom of all compilers, embodied in the universal tension between that which is attainable and that which should be attained. And with these reservations in mind, I want to give the book my best wishes on its way to the reading public, and say: I liber ‘Book, go forth’! May your travel be as happy, and lead to as many interesting encounters, as was the case for the audacious young Englishman, whose peripeties inspired me while I was writing these lines.

Accessibility Theory

Natural discourse does not start from scratch. Speakers routinely integrate new information with contextual assumptions, roughly, information that they can take for granted, and so they need not assert it (Sperber and Wilson, 1986/1995). Referring to discourse entities, an inherent feature of human interactions, is no different. Although some discourse entities are (treated as) new (a kiss in [1]), most are (treated as) identifiable (e.g., the review, Helen, her in [1], and her heart, a first-mention, in [2]). Thus, part of the nonasserted material is information about discourse entities that the speaker would like the addressee to retrieve (for citations of SBC [Santa Barbara corpus], see Du Bois et al., 2000, 2003. [. . .] ¼ a short fragment deleted):

(1) LORI:
LINDA: LORI:

when you were reading the review, you talked about the affair between
Helen and Paul, [. . .] all that happened was, was a kiss. [. . .] He kissed her, (SBC: 023).

(2) DORIS: they had an autopsy done on her. And her heart, was just hard, (SBC: 001).

Accessibility Theory (Ariel, 1985a, 1985b, 1988a, 1990, 2001), in effect a development of Sanford and Garrod (1981) and Givo´ n (1983) (and see also Chafe, 1994), assumes a logically prior distinction between identifiable/Given entities (coded as definite) and nonidentifiable/Given entities (coded as indefinite). Identifiable entities are ones for which the addressee is assumed to be able to access mental representations (see Du Bois, 1980; Heim, 1982). Accessibility theory seeks to account for the selection and interpretation of all definite referring expressions. The theory does not assume (as fundamental) the first versus subsequent mention distinction, and provides one and the same account for expressions considered referential (e.g., proper names), often used for discourse first-mentions, as well as for expressions considered

anaphoric (e.g., pronouns), often used for subsequent mentions (Ariel, 1990, 1994, 1996). It also does not view references to the speech situation (e.g., by deictics) as special (Ariel, 1998a). All definite referring expressions in all languages are analyzed as accessibility markers, as instructions to the addressee on how to access specific mental representations. In fact, the theory handles other types of Given materials as well, most notably whole propositions (see Ariel, 1985a, 1985b, 1988b).
Using a definite NP, the speaker signals to her addressee to access some mental representation based either on his encyclopedic knowledge, his awareness of the speech situation, or his discourse model of the interaction so far (Clark and Marshall, 1981). The definite referring expression also provides information about the intended entity, which the addressee is to rely on when zeroing in on the intended referent (e.g., her is a singular female). This is as far as the definiteness aspect takes us, but speakers can be even more helpful. Mental representations are not equally accessible to us at any given stage of the discourse. Some are highly activated, others are mildly activated, and yet others, although potentially identifiable, are not currently activated at all. Speakers refer to discourse entities at all activation levels. This is where accessibility theory plays a crucial role. It helps the addressee pick the correct mental representation by indicating to him the degree of accessibility with which the mental representation is currently entertained. The claim is that each referring expression specializes for a specific degree of mental accessibility, hence the term accessibility markers for referring expressions. On this view, addressees search mental representations not only based on the content of the referring expression, but also based on the degree of accessibility indicated by the speaker.
Since mental accessibility comes in a rich array of degrees, accessibility markers can be graded on a scale of accessibility marking, some indicating very low degrees of mental accessibility, others indicating various intermediate and high degrees of accessibility. The following partially grammaticized (see Ariel, 2001) accessibility marking scale, starting with very

2 Accessibility Theory

low accessibility markers and ending with extremely high accessibility markers, has been proposed in Ariel (1990), but the list is not intended to be exhaustive:
(3) Full name þ modifier > full name > long definite description > short definite description > last name > first name > distal demonstrative þ modifier > proximate demonstrative þ modifier > distal demonstrative þ NP > proximate demonstrative þ NP > distal demonstrative (-NP) > proximate demonstrative (-NP) > stressed pronouns þ gesture > stressed pronoun > unstressed pronoun > cliticized pronoun > verbal person agreement markers > zero.
For example, the affair between Helen and Paul in (1) is a long definite description. The prediction is that it indicates a mental representation that is not as accessible as the shorter the review or he. Indeed, the review is what the interlocutors have been discussing. But the affair, as such, was not explicitly mentioned in the conversation, and in fact, according to Lori, it’s not even clear that there was one. He (a pronoun) refers to the highly accessible Paul, who was just mentioned.
Now, the correlations between specific referring expressions and specific degrees of mental accessibility are not arbitrary. This is why (3) is virtually a universal. By and large, the accessibility marking scale is governed by three coding principles: informativity, rigidity, and attenuation. Informativity predicts that more informative expressions be used when the degree of accessibility is relatively low. It is only reasonable for the speaker to provide the addressee with more information if the mental representation is not (highly) activated, so he can better identify the intended entity from among the many he entertains at a low degree of accessibility. Rigidity predicts that a (more) uniquely referring expression (such as a proper name), rather than a relatively nonrigid expression (such as a pronoun), should be used when degree of accessibility is low (cf. Helen, Paul with her, he in [1]). Finally, attenuation predicts that greater phonological size (including the presence of stress) correlates with lower degrees of accessibility, whereas smaller phonological size correlates with higher degrees of accessibility (cf. definite descriptions vs. pronouns, and even more so with zero).
The three principles overlap to a large extent. Quite often, informative expressions are also relatively rigid and unattenuated. However, this is not invariably so. The newspaper and United States of America are as informative and rigid as the paper and US(A), respectively, but they are not as attenuated. Accordingly, the lower accessibility markers are found in contexts

where a lower degree of accessibility is the case (see Ariel, 2001, inter alia). Similarly, in languages with verbal person agreement, there is no difference in the informativity and rigidity between independent pronouns (e.g., Hebrew ani, ‘I’) and the corresponding agreement marker (þti for past tense). But distributional patterns show that the independent pronoun (less attenuated) is used when the speaker is less accessible. Finally, for Western names, it’s usually the case that first and last names are equally informative and attenuated, but they are not equally rigid. Last names tend to pick a referent more uniquely than first names (simply because there is a greater variety of last names). Accordingly, Ariel (1990: 45) correlates the two types of names with different textual positions, showing that anaphoric first names mostly find their antecedents within the same paragraph, but last names have three times as many cross-paragraph anaphoric relations. This points to the lower degree of accessibility indicated by last names.
Distance between a previous and a current mention of the entity (recency) is indeed one important factor determining degree of accessibility. Naturally, the longer the time elapsed between the previous and the current reference, the less activated the representation, so that relatively lower accessibility markers are called for. Note that the relationship between the antecedent and the anaphor, their Unity, is not simply measured in number of words (only), but rather, syntactic boundaries (e.g., the clause), textual boundaries (the paragraph, the episode), and pragmatic boundaries (units more vs. less cohesively linked to each other) define the closeness between a potential antecedent and its anaphor, dictating higher or lower accessibility markers depending on how ‘distant’ the two are from each other. When a discourse entity is inferred based on another, we similarly see differences according to how automatic/stereotypic the inference connecting the two is (cf. her heart in [2], which is easily inferred from her, given that humans have hearts, with his sense of character values based on his referring to Mister Forster – SBC: 023, where we don’t automatically assume that people have a ‘‘sense of character values’’). Empirical evidence for these Unity claims can be found in Clancy (1980), Sanford and Garrod (1981), Givo´ n (1983), and Ariel (1985a and onward).
Unity features mostly pertain to anaphoric references. Referent salience is important for all types of reference, first-mention referential expressions included. Some discourse entities are inherently more salient: the speaker and addressee (vs. third persons), humans (especially vs. inanimates), and famous personalities (vs. anonymous people). Other discourse entities have a prominent ad hoc status, mostly

Accessibility Theory 3

because they constitute discourse topics. The predictions are then that higher accessibility markers will serve these more salient discourse entities. Competition over the role of intended referent between potential mental representations may, however, lower the degree of accessibility of each, mainly of nontopics. It then calls for lower accessibility markers:

(4) MARY:

What I have to do,
is take off the distributor wirei, and splice iti in with the fuel pump
wirej. Because my . . . fuel pumpj is now
electric, (SBC: 007).

(5) In the reference, each author is referred to by name and initials. There is a single exception – to avoid the possibility of confusion, first names are always included for David Payne, Doris Payne, John Payne, Judith Payne and Thomas Payne (Dixon, 1994: xvi–xvii).
In (4), the more topical entity is coreferred to by it, the nontopic by an informative lexical NP (my fuel pump). In (5), presumably equally accessible entities are all referred to by lower accessibility markers (full names), because they compete with each other (initial þ Payne is not rigid enough in this context).
It is important to remember, however, that accessibility theory makes claims about correlations between referring expressions and degree of accessibility, measured as a total concept, rather than by any one of its components (e.g., topic, distance, or competition). In other words, the prediction is that accessibility marker selection is determined by weighing together a whole complex of accessibility factors, which together determine what the degree of accessibility of a given discourse entity is at the current stage of the discourse (see Toole, 1996; Ariel, 1999). This is why, for example, even speakers are not invariably referred to by the highest accessibility markers (zero in Hebrew). Although the speaker is a highly salient discourse entity, if she’s not topical or if it’s competing with another antecedent, it may be referred to by an independent pronoun.
Finally, accessibility theory is universal (see Ariel, 1990: 4.2), although not all languages have exactly the same set of referring expressions, and even when these seem to be identical, they may rate differently for the three coding principles (informativity, rigidity, and attenuation, e.g., cf. English and Japanese pronouns). Provided they are comparable, all referring expressions are predicted to indicate the same relative, though not absolute, degrees of accessibility. Thus, in all languages zeroes indicate a higher degree of accessibility than pronouns, but not all languages

allow cross-sentential zero anaphora. Accessibility theory applies to all genres/registers (see Ariel, in press). In fact, because accessibility related discourse patterns are so common in diverse registers and languages, we can account for various cross-linguistic grammaticization paths. For example, the recurrent creation of verbal person agreement markers for first/second persons, but not for third persons (via the cliticization of the high accessibility markers used for the very salient speaker and addressee; see Ariel, 1998b, 2000), as well as universal constraints on the use of resumptive pronouns (see Ariel, 1999). At the same time, accessibility constraints may be violated to create special pragmatic effects (e.g., Jamie the old lady (SBC: 002) is too low an accessibility marker, when used by Jamie’s husband in her presence).

Cultural-historical activity theory (CHAT) is a school of thought concerning itself with the relation and interaction between humans and their material and social environment. Originally a psychological tradition, it has been expanded into a more general, multidisciplinary approach, which is used (besides in psychology) in semiotics, anthropology, sociology, cognitive science, linguistics, and design research. Thus, it would be more suitable to call it a framework, an approach, or a research program. From another perspective, CHAT is one of the few research traditions in human sciences originating in the former Soviet Union that have been able to gain acceptance in the Western research.
Historical Background
Cultural-historical activity theory, CHAT, originated in attempts by psychologists, as early as the 1920s, to establish a new, Marxist-based approach to

psychology. The foundation of Activity Theory was laid by L. S. Vygotsky during the 1920s and early 1930s. (see Vygotskij, Lev Semenovich.) His work was continued by A. N. Leont’ev and A. R. Lurija, who both developed his ideas further and began to use the term ‘activity.’ (A good historical review of that development can be found in Leont’ev, 1989.) For a Marxist psychologist, who favors a monistic explanation of human mental processes, the Cartesian mind-body dualism is unacceptable. Thus, the starting point of CHAT is that human thinking has both phylogenetically and ontogenetically emerged and developed in practical action and social interaction in the world; there is no separate mind that could be studied in isolation from these actions; significantly, the individual person is thus not a real unit of the analysis of mind. In any such analysis, the purposefulness of actions must be taken into account, and therefore it is necessary to include a minimal context that makes the actions meaningful for the acting subject. This context, typically a purposeful, social system of actions, is called an activity. Certain general principles within this framework include object orientation; mediation by culturally and historically formed artifacts (tools and signs);

hierarchical structure of activity; and zone of proximal development.

Activity Theory 5

Object Orientation
The most central feature of CHAT is that activities are oriented towards a specific object and that different objects separate activities from each other. In this tradition, the concept of object is complex and loaded. Activities emerge when human needs find a way to be fulfilled in the world. The object here is the entity or state of the world, the transformation of which will hopefully produce the desired outcome. An object has, thus, a double existence: it exists in the world as the material to be transformed by artifactual means and cooperative actions, but also as a projection on to the future—the outcome of the actions. The object is not exactly given beforehand, but it unfolds and concretizes in the interactions with the material and the conditions. Being a constantly reproduced purpose of a collective activity that motivates and defines the horizon of possible goals and actions, the ‘sharedness’ of the object is present only in social relations across time and space, as well as embodied in terms of history. Locally, the sharedness of an object is a process of social construction with divergent views and creative uses of cultural and interactional resources. Activities are thus often multivoiced, and none of the existing perspectives on the object can be defined as right—such a definition can only be given within an activity.
Mediation
The notion of tool mediation is one of the central features of CHAT. Actions are mediated by culturally and historically constituted artifacts, an artifact being defined as something that has been manufactured by a human. Thus, our relation with the world is shaped not only by our personal developmental history and experiences from various interactions, but also by the history of the broader culture we are part of. The world has been concretized in the shape of tools, symbols, and signs that we use in our activities. The world does not appear to us as such, uncontaminated, but as a culturally and historically determined object of previous activities. Humans project both these earlier meanings and those that have arisen from the fulfillment of current needs on to their objects; at the same time, they envision the potential results to be achieved. (see Cognitive Technology.) Language is an essential part of this toolkit, a tool of tools. According to CHAT, all mediation has both a language side and a material character: symbols and signs, and tools and instruments are all integral

Figure 1 A model of the basic mediational structure. (S) subject, object (O), and medium (M) at the vertices of the triangle indicate the basic constraints of mind. The line S-O represents the ‘natural,’ (unmediated) functions; the line S-M-O represents the functions where interactions between subject and object are mediated by auxiliary means. Stn is the subject’s state of knowledge at time n; Osm is the object as represented via the medium; On, object at time n; Stnþ1, emergent new state of the subject’s knowledge at time n þ 1 (Cole and Engestro¨ m, 1993: 5–7).

parts in the same mediation process. The basic mediational structure is depicted in Figure 1.
Thus the foundation of our actions is a continuous synthesis of two versions of the world: one directly given, the other culturally and historically mediated. Their synthesis enables us to plan our actions.
The Socio-Pragmatic Nature of the Sign
Activity Theory has paid much attention to semiotic mediation. Vygotsky’s final work Thought and Language (1934) has contributed greatly to the understanding of human mental activity in socio-cultural terms, by assigning a crucial function to language as a psychological tool capable of mediating the development of the mind. Language as a tool calls for the use of artificial stimuli, that is, the use of culturally and historically construed sign systems. Signs serve to control the psyche and behavior of others and the Self, bringing to bear traces of social activities and social relations sedimented in language.
Vygotsky’s socio-genetic approach to thought and language was developed originally in the research tradition of developmental psychology, aiming at understanding the child’s mental growth. Later works of CHAT have continued with semiotic mediation and identity formation by focusing more on language use and utilizing notions such as the internal and external dialogicality of discourse. (see Addressivity; Dialogism, Bakhtinian; Discourse, Foucauldian Approach; Discourse Processing.) The interest is here in analyzing language from the viewpoint of sense-making, as it takes place within the contexts of the complex relationship between pragmatic activity and social processes. Sense-making is viewed as an active,

6 Activity Theory

culturally mediated process within and with which the external world is translated into a conceivable world and organized into objects of activities. Social change of language is explored with the help of developmental trends of sense-making through which new elements of meaning come into our social interests without leaving old meanings untouched.
Overall Structure of Activities
According to Leont’ev (1978), activities have a threelevel hierarchical structure. Besides the activity level, which is a particular system of actions, and the action level itself, there is a third level, the lowest one, of operations. Operations are former actions that have become automated during personal development, and which are triggered within actions by specific conditions in the situation. Whereas in actions, there are always planning, execution, and control phases, operations are much more condensed, rapid, and smooth. To become skilled in something is to develop a collection of related operations. Operations are not, however, like conditioned reflexes: if the conditions do not fit, the operations return back to the action level.
In the tradition of the founders of CHAT, new forms for depicting activity have been elaborated. The most influential attempt to model an activity is due to Engestro¨ m. In his Learning by expanding, he aimed at defining a historically and concretely constituted system that has a timespan and internal transformations of its own. The model is presented in Figure 2.
In Figure 2, the model of individual action in Figure 1 has been complemented to depict the
Figure 2 A model of an activity system (based on Engestro¨ m, 1987). The initial mediational triangle of individual actions is expanded to cover the social and cooperative dimension of an activity by adding a community sharing the same object and two new mediational relationships: social-cultural (‘rules’) between the subject and the community, and power/organizing (‘division of labor’) between the community and the shared object. The model is systemic in the sense that all elements have a relation with each other, but only the three main mediations are shown for the sake of clarity.

collective activity system. The model looks at the activity from the point of view of one actor, the subject, but the fact that subjects are constituted in communities is indicated by the point in the model labeled ‘community.’ The relations between the subject and the community are mediated, on the one hand, by the groups’ full collection of ‘tools’ (mediating artifacts) and, on the other hand, by ‘rules’ that specify acceptable interactions between members of the community, and ‘division of labor,’ the continuously negotiated distribution of tasks, powers, and responsibilities among the participants of the activity system (Cole and Engestro¨ m, 1993: 7).
In an activity, the relation between individual actions and the outcome of the whole activity becomes mediated and indirect. Leont’ev (1978) explained the relation between individual actions and collective activity using an example of primitive hunters who, in order to catch a game, separate into two groups: the catchers and bush-beaters, where the latter scare the game in order to make them move towards the former. Against the background of the motive of the hunt—to catch the game to get food and clothing material—the individual actions of the bushbeaters appear to be irrational unless they are put into the larger system of the hunting activity.
Zone of Proximal Development
Activity systems are socially and institutionally composed entities exhibiting internal conflicts which develop through transformations. The characteristic feature of CHAT is the focus on such changes; it studies cognition, including language, as a dynamic, culture-specific, and historically changing phenomenon constituting activity systems. In this context, the zone of proximal development (ZPD) has became Vygotsky’s most widely referenced notion. It concerns children’s learning processes, and refers to
the distance between the actual developmental level as determined by independent problem solving and the level of potential development as determined through problem solving under adult guidance or in collaboration with more capable peers. (Vygotsky, 1978: 86)
Current activity theoretical studies extend from Vygotsky’s dyadic pedagogical outline to potential horizons of different activities that will ‘‘mature tomorrow but are currently in an embryonic state.’’ In the tradition of developmental work research, Vygotsky’s ZPD indicates in outline the distance between present everyday actions and the historically new forms of the societal activity. In Engestro¨ m’s model, contradictions in activity systems are ‘‘structural misfits within or between activities. The new

Adaptability in Human-Computer Interaction 7

forms of activity can be collectively generated as a solution to the double bind potentially embedded in everyday actions.’’ (Engestro¨ m, 1987: 174). Contradictions may not be apparent or obvious, and they often appear as problems and disruptions in the flow of ordinary activities. In CHAT, new challenges of scientific concepts are also actively reflected in the ongoing research. Researchers in the areas of cognition and language studies are participating in the current development of discourse-based concepts.
The International Community
An international CHAT research community has been emerging, beginning from the late 1970s. In the early 1980s, there was a series of Northern European CHAT conferences on education; the first international CHAT conference was held in 1986 in Berlin, where the International Society for Cultural Research and Activity Theory (ISCRAT) was founded. This acronym was also the name used for a series of conferences: in Lahti, Finland, 1990; in Moscow, 1995; in Aarhus, Denmark, 1998; and in Amsterdam, 2002. A couple of these conferences have had their proceedings published as a selection of papers (Engestro¨ m et al., 1999; Chaiklin et al., 1998). In 2002, ISCRAT has joined forces with the Society of Socio-Cultural Studies (SSCS), resulting in a new society called International Society for Cultural and Activity Research (ISCAR), whose first joint world conference was held in Seville, Spain, in 2005.
From 1994 on, the CHAT-oriented Mind, Culture, and Activity. An International Journal has been published by Lawrence Erlbaum.

Adaptability in Human-Computer Interaction

J L Mey, University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark ß 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Introduction In this article, two main themes will be touched upon: first, I will discuss the general topic of humans’ adaptation to computers as tools, and conversely, how the

computer tool can be adapted to human needs; and second, a particular instance of this adaptive process, in which both humans become (more) literate on and through the computer and computers are becoming more ‘human,’ will be discussed under the label of ‘computer literacy.’ In both cases, emphasis will be placed on the cognitive aspects of the problems, as embodied in the metaphors that are current in this particular discourse.

8 Adaptability in Human-Computer Interaction

Adaptation and Adaptability
Adaptation
Earlier views on the computer as a tool (e.g., in human problem solving) have concentrated on the problem of adaptation: who or which is going to adapt to whom or which? (For a discussion of ‘adaptability’ vs. ‘adaptivity,’ where the latter is defined as a unilateral coercion on the human to conform to the patterns of behavior imposed by the computer, the former captures the necessity of letting the human decide to which degree, and to what purpose adaptation should be practiced, cf. Mey, 1998.)
Even though such efforts have their rationales in the context of computer modeling as it is usually understood, they do not touch upon the basic problem of adaptation, seen as a dialectic process of integrating two independent but interacting systems, the human and the computer (Mey and Gorayska, 1994). The case is analogous to that of perception; here, neither the senses nor the objects can be said, by themselves and unilaterally, to produce a sensation (e.g., of seeing). Perception is always perception of something, and it is always a perception by and in somebody. In the psychologist James J. Gibson’s words, it is a ‘‘circular act of adjustment’’ (Gibson, 1979): ‘‘The activity of perception is not caused, nor is it an act of pure will’’ (Reed, 1988: 200).
An adaptability approach to computing thus endeavors to integrate two systems:
1. the human user, and 2. the computer tool.
In human-computer interaction, the human neither unilaterally ‘acts’ upon the computer, nor does the computer unilaterally prescribe the human some restricted form of activity. Rather, each system adapts to the other; their functional qualities, taken together, are what makes the use of the computer as a tool possible. In Gibsonian terms, tool making and tool using are tantamount to looking for and exploiting ‘‘affordances’’ (Gibson, 1979). To see this, consider the way our adaptation to, and interaction with, computers is characterized by our use of metaphors (see Metaphor: Psychological Aspects).
Computers and Metaphors
Like every other human activity, the use of computers has generated its own set of metaphors. We do our word processing using a ‘mouse,’ ‘scroll’ files up and down, ‘chase’ information on the Internet, get ‘lost’ in cyberspace, or trapped in the ‘mazes’ of the ‘web’; and even if we have no idea what we are doing where in cyberspace, it can always be called ‘surfing.’ It’s as if we were hanging out on the corners of our

computational space – what one could call, using a novel metaphor, our ‘cyber-hood,’ our computerized neighborhood.
Among the various metaphors that currently characterize the computer and its use by humans, that of ‘tool’ has been one of the most pervasive. Just as tools help us execute certain activities better and faster, so too has the computer been considered a tool for performing certain operations (such as bookkeeping, accounting, tallying, registering, archiving, and so on) in a better, more efficient, and especially faster way. Among the attributes of this tool that have attracted most attention are, naturally, the ease with which it ‘falls into’ the human hand and routine; by extension, the computer is not even thought of as a tool any longer: enter the invisible, or ‘transparent’ tool (as I have called it; Mey, 1988), to be preferred over other, more visible and obtrusive kinds of instruments. The computer that adapts itself to the human user becomes an extension of the human body; conversely, the adaptable human user will treat the computer not just as any old tool, but rather as a crutch, a ‘scaffolding’ (in Bruner’s terminology; Bruner, 1983), or even as a prosthesis, as we will see below (see Scaffolding in Classroom Discourse).
A Case in Point: The Computer as Prosthesis
It has been well known, ever since the pioneering work of people like Carroll (1991), that the tool we use to perform a particular task not only assists us in doing what we have to do, but also changes our understanding of the task itself and of a host of other things related to the task. It may change the very nature of the task altogether. For instance, to cite a classical case, the vacuum cleaner was originally introduced to alleviate and lessen a housekeeper’s boring chores. In the end, it has increased the workload and made the work itself even more boring, because now it had to be performed more often and to a greater degree of perfection. The tool changes the task, and vice versa, in a never-ending ‘‘spiral’’ (Salomon, 1993).
With regard to computers, the tool has frequently been likened to a prosthesis. In the context of our discussion, this has had some profound effects. A prosthesis, one could say, is simply an augmentation of a human capability (either replacing a lost faculty or extending an existing one). But if we scratch this seemingly innocent surface, a host of hidden assumptions and unexpected problems turn up. First, there is the question of the augmentation itself: how far should we go, or be allowed to go, in the enhancing of the human sensory faculties? Using super-powered lenses and telecameras, we can spy

Adaptability in Human-Computer Interaction 9

upon the most intimate happenings in the lives of famous people like the late Princess Diana. But even though the majority of readers of the tabloid press would not be without their daily dose of lurid photojournalism, everybody agrees in condemning the excesses of the paparazzi when their need for media coverage directly or indirectly harms the celebrities they are pursuing, as it happened in the case of Princess Diana’s death. ‘‘They are going too far,’’ we hear people say. But what exactly is ‘going too far’ in what essentially is an adaptation of human goals and values to the possibilities of the tool? And how do we decide what is an acceptable limit for this adaptivity? On the one hand, more knowledge is more power; on the other, ‘curiosity killed the cat’ (and did irreparable damage to some notable humans and their progeny as well, as the case of Adam and Eve amply illustrates).
The Fragmented Body
The tool metaphor of the computer as a prosthesis carries with it yet another drawback. Since prostheses typically target one particular human capacity for augmentation, we come to think of our capacities as individually ‘enhanceable.’ There are two aspects to this enhancing: one, we consider only the individual agent, without taking his or her larger societal context into account; and two, we enhance single faculties in the individual, without taking into account the fact that these capacities form a unit, a human whole.
As to the first aspect, the societal character of our capacities, consider the ‘paradox of success’ that Kaptelinin and Kuutti (1999) have drawn attention to: what succeeds in one context may, by its very success, be expected to be a failure in another, seemingly similar environment. Thus, the very fact that, say, a decision-making computer tool has proven successful in the United States may warn us against trying to introduce it into a Japanese surrounding, where decisions among humans are made in ways that are very different from what is common practice in the U.S. (Kaptelinin and Kuutti, 1999: 152).
The other aspect relates to a currently popular notion of human capacities as being ‘modularly replaceable.’ Just as we are seeing the beginnings of ‘surgical engineering,’ in which techniques of replacement have substituted for old-fashioned operation and healing procedures, so we are witness to a trend toward substituting and augmenting not only parts of the body itself (such as is done in heart or kidney transplantation), but entire mental functions. A reasoning chip implanted in our brain relieves us from the headaches of going through the motions of filling in the trivial parts of a mathematical proof or a chain of syllogisms. A chip may replace

a person’s worn-out or Alzheimer-affected memory capacities. In general, wetware can be replaced by more sturdy and robust electronic hardware, prewired to augment specific mental functions, and even tooled precisely to fit the needs of a particular individual. The potential for prosthetic innovations of this kind is virtually unlimited, up to the point where the whole person may end up being ‘retooled’ electronically (see Cognitive Technology).
The Effects of Adapting
Despite these problems, we are not exactly prepared to shut down our machines in the name of a return to basics, a kind of information-age Ludditism. We will have to live with the computer, even if our adaptation to it, as well as its role as an adaptive prosthesis, carries serious problems, generating side effects some of which were not intended. Here, it is useful to distinguish between primary and secondary effects. To take a well-known example, when Henry Ford wanted to put an automobile in everybody’s front yard, the primary effect of this ‘automotive revolution’ was that people were able to travel farther and in ways not imagined before. But the secondary effects, not foreseen by Ford or anybody else at the time, included our adaptation to this new transportation device: our mind-set changed, the automobile becoming our premier status symbol, our ‘escape on wheels,’ for some even serving as an extra bedroom. In due course, these secondary effects (including the need to build more and more highways, in the process destroying entire rural and urban environments in the name of transportation, creating a new, ‘suburban’ life style for millions of people, and so on and so forth) were much more important than the simple primary effects in regard to our modes of transportation. The innovative tool re-creates that which it was only supposed to renew: the prosthetic tail wags the human dog.
Another problem with the prosthesis metaphor, when applied to the computer, is that of augmentation. The prosthetic tool, be it a crutch or a pair of binoculars, augments our motor or visual capacities. The notion of augmenting a human faculty presupposes the existence of something which is not augmented, or ‘natural.’ The trouble with humans, however, is that ‘natural’ behavior is a fiction; while we do have certain ‘innate’ functions (the faculty of speech, the ability to walk upright, and so on), these functions cannot be put to work ‘naturally’ unless we ‘initialize’ them, break them in socially and culturally. And in order to do this properly, we need tools. In particular, in any learning situation, we need what Bruner called a ‘scaffolding’: a total learning environment where

10 Adaptability in Human-Computer Interaction

the learner is gradually introduced to the next higher level of competency, all the way relying on the availability of physical and mental ‘crutches’. And the more we enhance our human, culturally bound and socially developed functions, the less we rely on those crutches as external prostheses; we internalize the tools by making them part of ourselves, adapting and incorporating them, as it were, to the point where they are both ‘invisible’ and indispensable.
As an illustration, I will discuss the case of the word processor, thus leading into the second part of this article, which deals with the problems involved in computer literacy.
Computer Literacy
The Word Processor
A word processor is basically a tool for enhanced writing. Starting from the early, primitive off- and online text editors (such as RUNOFF or EDDY), modern word processors (such as the latest editions of Microsoft Word or WordPerfect) are highly sophisticated devices that not only help you write, but actually strive to improve your writing – and not just physically or orthographically. Text editors, for instance, will tell you that a sentence is ill formed or too long, or that a particular concept has not been properly introduced yet.
Computerized functions such as these may facilitate the ways in which we produce texts; on the other hand, the texts we produce are in many ways rather different from those that originated in a noncomputerized environment. Here, I’m not talking only about the outer appearances of a document (by which a draft may look like a final version of an article, and be judged on that count), but rather about the ways we practice formulating our ideas.
For instance, if we know that what we write may be disseminated across an international network, or abstracted in a database that is used by people from different walks of life and contrasting ethnic and cultural backgrounds, we will try to express ourselves in some kind of ‘basic conceptualese,’ shunning the use of metaphors and idiomatic expressions, thus sacrificing style to retrievability of information. As Oracle’s Kelly Wical observed, such automated indexing of documents ‘‘will encourage people to write plainly, without metaphors . . . that might confuse search engines. After all, everyone wants people to find what they have written’’ (Wical, 1996; see also Gorayska, Marsh and Mey, 1999: 105 ff.).
In the following, I will examine some of these effects, and inquire into their desirability and/ or inevitability.

Why Computer Literacy?
If literacy (no matter how we interpret this term) has to do with people’s capacities for handling ‘letters’ (Latin: literae), then one may ask: What’s so special about the computer that we need to define a special concept called ‘computer literacy’? After all, people have been using the notion of literacy for ages, and there has never been a need to define a special kind of literacy for a particular tool of writing, such as a chisel, brush, or pen. Whereas ‘penmanship’ has become a synonym of ‘high literacy’ (no longer necessarily exercised by means of a pen), nobody has ever felt the need to define ‘typewriter literacy’ in terms other than in number of words per minute: a good (‘literate,’ if you want) typist can do at least 100 words per minute without committing too many errors, whereas a beginner or ‘illiterate’ person only can do 30 or 40 and will have to use a lot of time correcting his or her mistakes. In other words, there must be a difference, but what is it?
Writer and Tool
What makes a difference is in the relationship of the writer to his or her instrument: chisel and hammer, stylus and wax, quill and parchment, pen and paper, keyboard and screen. This relationship has not always been simple and straightforward; in particular, it has been known to influence the very way people write. The ancient Greek scribes who performed their craft in stone didn’t bother to drag all their utensils back to the beginning of the line they just had finished: instead, they let the new line begin where the old one had stopped, only one level lower; thus, the script called boustrophedon (literally: ‘the way the [plowing] oxen turn’) came into being, with lines alternating in their direction of writing/reading. The medieval monks who wrote on parchment often tried to ‘recycle’ this precious and hard-to-get material by erasing earlier scripts and overwrite the deleted text, a technique known by the name of palimpsest. (By an irony of history, in due course the deleted text often turned out to be more valuable than the overwritten one. Many of the sources for our editions of the classical authors are due to the monks’ parsimonious writing techniques.)
Undoubtedly, the invention of wood (later lead) letter type contributed greatly to the dissemination of written literature; yet, the effects on the scribe were never a matter of reflection. Much later, when the typewriter got naturally to be used for the purposes of office work, personal letters and literary ‘works of art’ still had to be composed by hand, if they were to be of any value. Even in a more practically oriented domain such as that of journalism, it is a known fact that the formidable, in life chief editor

Adaptability in Human-Computer Interaction 11

of the Vatican daily Osservatore Romano, forbade the use of typewriters in his offices as late as 1948. His journalists had to write all copy by hand and then give it to a typist or typesetter.
The interaction between writer and tool changed dramatically with the advent of the computer. Not only is this writing instrument more perfect than any of its predecessors, but in addition it possesses a great number of qualities enabling people to approach their writing tasks in a different way. Accordingly, ‘computer literacy’ can be defined as: knowing how to exploit the various new uses to which the ‘computer interface’ between humans and letters can be put. Let’s consider some of these uses.
How (Not) to Use a Computer
Here, I will not discuss the more specialized functions that computer writing has inherited from earlier technologies, merely perfecting but not changing them: bookkeeping and accounting (cf., the use of so-called ‘spread sheets’), tabulating, making concordances, automated correspondence, and other office work (e.g., the automatic reminders one gets from one’s credit card company or the local utilities services). The truly revolutionary aspect of computer literacy is in the effect it has on the writing process itself, that which earlier was thought of by some as sacrosanct, immune to any kind of mechanical implementation.
One could say that a truly ‘computer literate’ person is one who composes his or her literary production directly on the computer, without any interference except from the interface itself. This is a bit like composing directly on the piano, except that the keyboard there normally does not retain what has been played on it. In contrast, the conserving function of the computer is precisely what enables writers to enter into a totally new relationship with their tool.
Earlier work, being dependent on the paper medium, had to be meticulously corrected in the text itself, often with great problems of legibility and understanding (scratching or crossing out, ‘whiting out,’ overwriting, writing in between the lines and in the margins, cutting and pasting, and so on, with multiple versions often canceling out one another, or at least making perhaps better original lines impossible to retrieve). However, the computer allows the text producer to maintain near-complete independence of the material side of writing.
Paper has always been said to be ‘patient’ in that it did not protest against whatever the author put down on it, suffering great works of art and utterly trivial composition alike to be entered on its impartial

surface. In comparison, the patience that the computer exhibits is not just an inherent quality of the tool: it is transferred to, and located within, the computer ‘literate’ who knows that Pilate’s age-old adage Quod scripsi, scripsi, ‘‘What I have written, I have written’’ (John, 19: 22) has been rendered null and void by this new medium. Here, it doesn’t matter what is written, for everything can always be reformulated, corrected, transformed, and recycled at the touch of a keystroke or using a few specialized commands. In extreme cases, we even may see the computer generate near-automatic writing (in the sense of the surrealists), with fingers racing across the keyboard and authors failing to realize what’s driving them on. Subsequently, the author who checks and goes over the results may often marvel at the ‘inventions’ that he or she has been guilty of producing, almost without being aware of the process by which they happened.
Perspectives and Dangers
I will conclude this entry by pointing to some of the perspectives that manifest themselves in a considered approach to the problem of adapting to/from the computer/human, especially as they appear in the context of computer literacy. In addition, I will say a few words about the possible dangers involved in the headlong embrace of new technologies (and their implied mental representations and ideologies) just because they are new. First, there is that age-old dilemma (going all the way back to Plato): Is the human just a kind of idealized entity coupled to a material reality (‘a mental rider on a material beast of burden’)? Or do we conceive of the union of the two in different ways, now that we have better metaphors to deal with these questions (especially the vexing problem of ‘which is master’: mind over matter or the other way around)?
Mind and Body Conceiving of the computer as a prosthesis may seem to finally resolve that ancient dichotomy: the mind-body split. If anything in the mind can be reproduced on a computer, then we don’t need the body at all. Or, vice versa, if the computerized body can take over all our mental functions, why then do we have to deal with a mind?
There are indeed tendencies afoot that seem to advocate this kind of thinking. Some years ago, a book by Andy Clark (1997, frontispiece) proudly announced, in its subtitle, the ability to ‘‘put brain, body, and world together again’’. However, this synthesis is performed strictly on the basis of a computeras-prosthesis informed philosophy: one describes

12 Adaptability in Human-Computer Interaction

the mental functions as (if need be, computerized) modules, united under a common ordering principle or joined loosely in some kind of mental republic, a ‘society of mind’ a` la Minsky (1986), where the different mental functions, conceived of as semiindependent but jointly organized modules, cooperate to form an organized, governing whole.
In Clark’s model, the emphasis is on the brain, not the mind, the latter being characterized as a ‘‘grabbag of inner agencies.’’ The ‘‘central executive in the brain – the real boss who organizes and integrates the activities’’ is said to be ‘‘gone.’’ Also ‘‘[g]one is the neat boundary between the thinker (the bodiless intellectual engine), and the thinker’s world.’’ No wonder, then, that replacing this ‘‘comfortable image’’ puts us in front of a number of ‘‘puzzling (dare I say metaphysical?) questions’’ (Clark, 1997: 220–221). Leaving those questions aside in our context, let me briefly explore some possible practical consequences of this ‘dementalization,’ when seen as involving a decentralization of the individual’s capacities.
Mind, Creativity, and Control While the acquisition of computer literacy as a condition for employment does not create much of a difference as compared with earlier situations (except for the extra cost and training it involves), the use of the computer in creative contexts represents a true breakthrough in the relationship of humans to their work, especially as regards their ways of creative production and reproduction. The interesting question here is not what the computer does to our hands, but in what ways it affects our mental ability to shape and reshape, to work out a thought, and then abandon it (but not entirely!). It is also in how it allows us to come back to earlier thoughts and scraps of insights that were jotted down in the creative trance, as it were – perhaps recombining these disiecta membra with other pieces of thought, all available at the drop of a keystroke. This qualitative change of our relationship with our creative tools is the true computer revolution; it defines ‘computer literacy’ as being qualitatively different from earlier, more primitive, creative and cognitive technologies.
The imminent danger of the spread of computer literacy is, of course, that any Tom, Dick or Emma who can handle a keyboard may consider themselves to be geniuses of writing, thus offsetting the positive effect of increased literacy through this reduction of the computer tool to an instrument of and for the inane and mindless. More importantly though, the danger exists that users, because of the apparent naturalness of their relationship to the computer, start considering themselves as natural extensions of the machine, as human tools. Being ‘wired’ becomes thus

more than a facile metaphor: one has to be plugged into some network, both metaphorically and electronically, to be able to survive in today’s ‘wired’ society. The wireless person just ‘isn’t there.’
To see this, consider the way most people are wired into the mass media of communication: their lives and thoughts are dictated by the media. Whoever doesn’t plug into this immense network of ‘infotainment’ (information and entertainment), is ‘out,’ is an ‘outsider,’ in the strictest sense of the word; outside of the talk of the day at the workplace, outside of the discussions in the press, outside of the newscasts and television reports on current scandals and shootings. An ‘insider,’ on the other hand, does not (and cannot) realize to what extent the simple presence of thought and feelings, otherwise considered as ‘naturally’ arising within the mind, is due to his or her ‘wiredness,’ his or her connection to the networks. It takes the accidental ‘black screen’ (or some other temporary media deprivation) to make one fathom the depths of one’s dependency, the extent of one’s being ‘hooked up’ to the infotainment universe (and as a result, being ‘hooked on,’ not just ‘wired into,’ that universe).
‘Big Brother’ and the Mind’s ‘Holding Company’ A final issue is of a subtler, less technical, and for that reason all the more threatening, nature; it has to do with the nature of the mental prosthesis that the computer represents. The computer’s special features (programs and functions that are distributed throughout the hardware rather than being encapsulated in neat, identifiable blocks of instructions, routines being divided into subroutines to be used independently and/or recursively, and so on) have led some of us to think of the brain as a similarly organized, distributed architecture (like Minsky’s ‘‘society of mind,’’ mentioned above). In particular, the currently popular ‘connectionist’ view of mental processing is based on this analogy; the prosthesis metaphor, if applied within this frame of thinking, transforms the individual mental features and functions into a set of independent, yet connected components (what Clark irreverently called a ‘‘grab-bag of inner agencies’’; 1997: 221). The question is, and the problem remains, how to orchestrate all those brainy agencies into some kind of mental unit(y). For all practical purposes, one could replace the media outlets by some central instrument, have it wired directly into people’s heads, and bingo, we’re in business: the wired society becomes a frightening reality, with ‘Big Brother’ embodied in a central ‘Holding Company,’ a monster computer, controlling and directing our entire lives (cf. Big Brother and the Holding Company, 1968).

Addressivity 13

One frequently hears computer users employ expressions such as, ‘‘The computer is in a bad mood today’’ or ‘‘The computer doesn’t want to cooperate’’; one sees irritated users kick their machines, pound their keyboards, or scream at their screens, accusing these devices of lack of cooperation. Such expressions, when they are not caused by either the user’s poor computer literacy, or by a particular hardware or software deficiency, may reflect either a lack of critical awareness of the computer’s properties as an auxiliary tool, or a failure to distinguish between the respective roles of the partners in human-computer interaction and cooperation. The future of human computer interaction lies in the humanizing of the tool, not in the humans’ becoming more tool-oriented and tool-like. And as to adaptation and adaptability, I repeat what I said earlier: the computer tail should never be allowed to wag the user dog.

Addressivity

‘Addressivity’ (obrashchennost’) is a term coined by the Russian scholar Mikhail Bakhtin as part of his critique of traditional linguistics. It figures as well in the thinking of Bakhtin’s colleague, Valentin Voloshinov, and it is helpful in understanding the approach to language and the psyche taken by

Lev Vygotsky (see Voloshinov, Valentin Nikolaevich; Vygotskij, Lev Semenovich).
Bakhtin’s work on language is best understood as part of his more general project to rethink the basis of the humanities and social sciences. Initially trained as a literary scholar, Bakhtin sought to reconceive the nature of ethics, psychology, literature, and language in such a way that choice, unpredictability, and open time were properly acknowledged. His work is suffused with the sense that the study of culture cannot be a science in the hard sense, a view that sets

14 Addressivity

him apart not only from his Marxist contemporaries but also from numerous schools since the 17th century. Because Bakhtin believed that human thought takes place primarily in the form of inner speech, a new understanding of language proved essential to his larger project of humanizing the ‘human sciences.’
Bakhtin reacted to the beginnings of formalist and structuralist linguistics, which he understood as methods of understanding human speech as an instantiation of rules. In this model, the linguist studies the rules, langue, and regards individual speech acts, parole, as entirely explicable in terms of the rules (see Principles and Rules). This model and its attendant assumptions seemed to Bakhtin to exclude not only all that we think of as pragmatics and the social aspects of language but also everything that is truly creative in any dialogue between real people. Bakhtin wanted to formulate an alternative model that treated language, thought, and action as capable of genuine ‘surprisingness’ (see Conspicuity).
To this end, Bakhtin distinguished between sentence and utterance. The sentence is a unit of language understood as structuralists do. It does not take place at any specific point in time, and so is repeatable; the same sentence may be spoken on different occasions. The utterance, by contrast, is a specific act of speech that someone says to someone else on a specific occasion, and its meaning depends in part on the occasion. Each occasion is different, and so utterances are never repeatable. The utterance is a historical event and is part of a dialogue. Sentences provide resources for an utterance, but the utterance requires more than the sentence. Linguistics properly conceived should deal with utterances as well as sentences, but so long as language is understood in terms of sentences, we should call the discipline that studies utterances ‘metalinguistics.’
What utterances contain that sentences do not is addressivity. Utterances are constituted by the fact that they are part of a specific dialogic exchange. Addressivity denotes all those aspects of the utterance that make it dialogic in the deepest sense (see Dialogism, Bakhtinian). Sentences contain only the potential to mean something, but utterances actually do mean something. In Bakhtin’s terms, sentences have meaning (in Russian, znachenie) in the sense of dictionary-andgrammar meaning, but utterances have smysl (roughly, sense, or meaning in a real context).
One cannot solve the problem of context by writing a grammar for it. Although one can say many general things about context, no grammar of context could ever fully specify it, because context is as various as human purposes, which are irreducible to a set of

rules. No matter how many helpful rules one may devise, there will always be a ‘surplus’ (izbytok). Bakhtin uses the same term, ‘surplus,’ to describe that aspect of human beings that is left over after all conceivable causal explanations have been applied. One’s true selfhood begins where all possible categories and causes have been exhausted. In selfhood, the ‘surplus’ constitutes our humanness, and in utterances it constitutes the manifestation of humanness in language.
Addressivity involves everything that takes the resources of speech – dictionary meanings, grammar, syntax, rules of context – and turns them into an utterance. In practice, Bakhtin’s work involved specifying features of context that were left out by structural linguistics, and so it overlaps strongly with pragmatics. It would be possible to absorb many of Bakhtin’s insights into pragmatics without accepting his view of humanness, indeterminism, and the surplus (see Pragmatics: Overview).
Consider, for instance, the telegraphic model of language in which a speaker, intending to convey a message, instantiates the rules of language to produce a sentence. In that model, the message is then sent out through a medium to a listener, who decodes the sentence and so recuperates the original meaning. Speaking is encoding, and listening is subsequent decoding. The first problem with this model, in Bakhtin’s view, is that nothing in this description would change if the listener were asleep, absent, or entirely different. But in real exchanges, the listener does not passively decode. Understanding is an active process in which the listener not only decodes, but also imagines how the utterance is meant to affect him or her, how it responds to past and potential utterances, and how third parties might respond. With all these factors in mind, the listener prepares a response that is revised as the utterance is being heard. Understanding is personal, processual, and active. Because every speaker counts on understanding of an active sort, the listener shapes the utterance from the outset. Speakers formulate their utterances with a specific listener or kind of listener in mind. This anticipation of a listener, which in ordinary speech is often guided by responses we sense as we are speaking, alters the tone, choice of words, and style of each utterance as a work in process.
Except in the purely physiological sense, each utterance is a co-creation of speaker and listener. It is essentially joint property. Bakhtin offers a series of examples, drawn from Dostoevsky’s novels, of utterances whose whole point and stylistic shape would be missed without considering addressivity. In ‘the word with a loophole,’ for instance, the speaker deliberately exaggerates a self-characterization so that, if the response is undesired, the utterance allows

Addressivity 15

him to pretend after the fact that it was parodic or unserious. The utterance builds into itself future utterances to more than one possible response.
Such utterances are not only common in daily speech, but also figure in our psyche. Because thought largely consists of inner dialogues, our minds are composed of the listeners that inhabit us – our parents or other figures whose responses count for us. We address them when we think, and so our very thought is shaped by imagined anticipated responses. We justify ourselves, or guide our thoughts by what significant internalized others might say. We grow and change as we absorb new listeners or learn to address old ones differently.
Within and without, we live dialogically. Addressivity, the dialogue of inner and outer speech, involves not only the ‘second person’ (the listener) but also what Bakhtin calls the ‘third person.’ In different studies, the term ‘third person’ has two distinct meanings, both of which are essential to addressivity. Sometimes the third person refers to all those who have already spoken about the topic in question. No one speaks about anything as if he or she were Adam, the first to break the silence of the universe. Every topic has been ‘already spoken about’ and the words referring to this topic implicitly ‘remember’ the earlier things said about it and the contexts in which they were said. It is as if words have glue attaching to them the evaluations and meanings of earlier speakers. Thus, when we speak, we implicitly take a stand in relation to those earlier speakers, and our words may be spoken as if with quotation marks, at a distance, with various tones indicating qualification. Some words come already ‘overpopulated’ with earlier utterances. Our speech therefore contains implicit elements of reported speech (direct or indirect discourse) in which the framing utterance takes a stance with respect to the framed one. Such effects may not be visible in the words when viewed as parts of a sentence, but they are nevertheless keenly sensed by speaker and listener. We are in dialogue with our predecessors, and addressivity refers to this historical aspect of utterances as well as to the present speaker-listener relationship. Whether we are considering the second or third person in addressivity, the utterance is shaped by others.
A second sense of ‘third person’ refers to what Bakhtin calls the ‘superaddressee’ (nadadresat). We never turn over our whole selves to a listener, because we cannot count on perfect understanding. Each utterance is partially constituted by the projection of an ideal listener, an invisibly present third person who would understand perfectly. We sometimes make the superaddressee visible when, in talking with one person, we gesture, as if to say, ‘would you just listen to him!’ But visible or invisible, the superaddressee is

part of every utterance. The superaddressee may be personified as God or imagined as the voice of history, but strictly speaking it is a constitutive factor of the utterance itself. We implicitly address this perfect listener as well as the real one before us. The superaddressee also figures in our inner speech, where again it may be personified.
The idea of addressivity allows Bakhtin to analyze a series of utterances that may look linguistically or stylistically simple but that are in fact complex when we consider them as part of a dialogue. Imagine a conversation in which one speaker’s voice has been omitted but its intense effects have left their mark on the other speaker’s utterance: some speech is shaped as if that process had taken place, as if it were one part of a tense exchange. Such speech takes ‘sidelong glances’ at the other’s potential answer and may almost seem to cringe in anticipation of a response. Utterances may be ‘double-voiced,’ so that they seem to emerge from two speech centers simultaneously, each commenting on the other and addressing themselves to a third party. In extreme cases, such utterances may bespeak psychological disturbance, as in Dostoevsky. But double-voicedness also appears in simple form in parody. A vast variety of discourses become visible when we consider them from the perspective of addressivity (see Narrativity and Voice).
In contrast to such movements as ‘reader reception’ theory, Bakhtin sees the listener’s response as active, not just after an utterance is made, but also while it is being made. Bakhtin is attentive to the formulation of an utterance as a shifting process. An utterance may change in the course of being said – in response to others, to circumstances, or even to the sound of itself. We are ourselves one listener of our speech acts, impersonating potential others. Bakhtin regards a culture’s forms of addressivity as constantly changing in response to circumstances and the creativity of individuals. Some typical forms of addressivity may coalesce into speech genres, and to learn a language involves learning those genres. Speech genres differ from language to language and change over time (see Genre and Genre Analysis).
For Bakhtin, the idea that utterances may change as they are being made suggests that addressivity presumes a speaker truly ‘present’ and ethically ‘responsible’ (literally ‘answerable’ in the original Russian) for what he says and a listener present and responsible for how he listens. As speakers and listeners, we choose and may be held accountable for our choices. Nothing is already made or entirely explicable in terms of pre-given codes or prior causes. Thus, the concept of addressivity is closely connected with Bakhtin’s insistence that ethics can never be a mere instantiation of rules; each situation requires real

16 Anthropology and Pragmatics

presence and judgment. In what we do as in what we say, we really accomplish something never done before. Or as Bakhtin liked to say, there is no ‘alibi.’ These broad implications of addressivity explain why its pragmatic aspects belong to Bakhtin’s project of altering ‘the human sciences.’ He describes human beings as social to the core because even in our psyche we think by dialogue. Conversely, he describes society and language as possessing both surprisingness resulting from the creative aspects of each dialogue and ethical significance resulting from our answerability for each utterance with addressivity.

Anthropology and Pragmatics
W Koyama, Rikkyo University, Tokyo, Japan ß 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Introduction To see how anthropology and pragmatics are interrelated, we may start with the following observation: pragmatics concerns, first and foremost, actions and events that necessarily take place in context as actual happenings, that is, sociohistorically contextualized

unique happenings. Such happenings, however, may be seen as tokens of virtual regularities such as action types, event types, or even illocutionary types (see Speech Acts). Hence, pragmatics may be approached from two different points of departure, either the sociohistoric context or the decontextualized regularities. This condition has given rise to the two distinct scientific traditions dealing with ‘what we do’ (i.e., our praxis): either the social science of actions and events, such as sociology and anthropology, or the logico-linguistic science of propositionally

Anthropology and Pragmatics 17

centered regularities of speech acts. Both of these trends originated in (neo)Kantian philosophy (see later); they may be characterized as the pragmatic and the semantic tradition, respectively. Note, however, that the term ‘pragmatics’ is, by historical accident, attached to a branch of the semantic tradition. This tradition includes analytic logic, linguistics, and parts of psychology, anthropology, and pragmatics (e.g., ethnoscience, cognitive linguistics, and the theories of speech acts, implicature, and relevance). In contrast, the pragmatic tradition includes the social sciences, sociology, anthropology, critical philosophy, and parts of contemporary pragmatics such as critical discourse analysis and social pragmatics. In the following sections, the genealogies of these two post-Kantian traditions are elucidated, illustrating how linguistic anthropology is related to pragmatics (see Critical Applied Linguistics; Critical Discourse Analysis; Speech Acts; Implicature; Discourse, Foucauldian Approach; Pragmatics: Overview).
The Semantic Tradition
Let us start with the semantic tradition, which harkens back to the critical philosophy of Kant (1724– 1804), in which the problematic of ‘language’ and ‘meaning’ still lurked behind that of ‘(re)cognition’ and ‘judgment.’ The return-to-Kant movement of the late 19th century included not only the neo-Kantians in the narrow sense, such as Charles Peirce (see below), but also Gottlob Frege (1848–1925), who launched predicate logic and thereby started to reduce the (neo) Kantian problematic of ‘judgment’ and ‘value’ to questions of logical language (see Peirce, Charles Sanders; Frege, Friedrich Ludwig Gottlob). In particular, the notion of judgment, especially that of ‘synthetic’ judgment, became eclipsed by the analytic Satz (sentence, proposition), which was split into Kraft (e.g., assertoric, imperative, interrogative force) and Sinn (propositional content); the latter, again, was subdivided into categories and subcategories that could be characterized in formal-linguistic fashion, such as subject, predicate, and so on. Thus was born modern logic (analytic philosophy), to be pursued by Bertrand Russell (1872– 1970), Rudolf Carnap (1891–1970), John von Neumann (1903–1957), and others who studied formalstructurally encoded meanings outside the context of language use. Such studies, which later came to include work in Artificial Intelligence, became the main staple of 20th-century Anglophone philosophy. This analytic ‘linguistic turn’ (Rorty, 1967) was also taken by the linguists of that period, especially the formalists of the neo-Bloomfieldian and Copenhagen Schools. Like the logicians, they saw the essence of language,

as well as the essence of the science of language, in formal regularities (rules) and clear and distinct analysis, in a decontextualized environment. Eventually, the trends in logic and linguistics converged and gave rise to generative linguistics, led by Noam Chomsky (b. 1928), who learned neo-Bloomfieldian formalism from Zellig Harris (1909–1992) and logico-linguistic derivation from Carnap. Even granted that Carnap was an empiricist, like Charles Morris (see below) and Willard Quine (1908–2000), whereas Chomsky worked in a rationalist paradigm, these philosophers and linguists represented two sides of the same semantic tradition. Subsequently, with the success of what became known as the Chomskyan revolution, the dominance of the semantic tradition in linguistics and its subfields was confirmed in the 1960s.
Yet, this ‘revolution’ was just an evolution of an earlier condition. That is, in tandem with the advocates of ‘unified science’ such as Carnap and Morris, who tried to integrate all kinds of science on the basis of modern formal logic, using the method of modern physics, the neo-Bloomfieldians had elaborated and advanced a linguistic formalism that was meant to replace the humanistic, cosmographic concerns of philology and anthropological linguistics with the investigation into the formal regularities of language and mechanical analytic procedures. Doing this, they successfully turned linguistics into a model human science in the eyes of many. Thus, the semantic tradition evolved from logico-linguistics into the more empirical sciences of anthropology and cognitive psychology. As an instance, consider the mid-20th-century flourishing of ethnoscience, which was characterized by mechanical elicitation procedures, with anthropologists trying to identify the semantic categories of fauna, flora, kinship, color, etc., as emically apperceived by natives and etically described by ‘universal’ semantic categories. Eventually, ethnoscientific studies – such as those of color terms conducted by Berlin and Kay (1969), who were originally inspired by the Saussurean/Hjelmslevian formal-structural analysis – yielded to the more empirically oriented ‘prototype’ semantics developed by Eleanor Rosch and her school in the 1970s (cf., Blount, 1995). Similar empiricist orientations gained acceptance even in logic and linguistics; compare the rise of fuzzy logic (or, more generally, multivalued logic) and generative semantics. The three lines then converged to form cognitive linguistics, pursued by George Lakoff (b. 1941), Ronald Langacker (b. 1942), and their followers. Thus, the birth of an empirical semantic science, i.e., cognitive linguistics, which constitutes a branch of pragmatics today, has its origin in the Fregean analysis of decontextualized propositional content (Sinn), which gradually, yet increasingly, became accommodated to

18 Anthropology and Pragmatics

the empirical contexts of referential cognition and language use (Bedeutung).
But the Fregean legacy includes more. Recall that Frege reduced judgment to sentence, consisting of not only propositional content, but also force. This notion came to the attention of John Austin (1911–1960), a phenomenologically minded translator of Frege’s œuvre into English (compare Frege’s notions of propositional content vs. force with Austin’s notions of constative vs. performative and locution vs. per-/illocution) (see Austin, John L.; Speech Acts and Grammar). This move led to the emergence of what is often called modern pragmatics, as pursued by John Searle and his followers (formally, this trend can be captured by the expression F(p), where p and F stand for proposition and illocutionary force, respectively). Others, such as H. Paul Grice (cf. ‘what is said’ vs. ‘what is meant’) and the post- and neo-Griceans, followed suit (cf. the success of Daniel Sperber and Deirdre Wilson’s theory of relevance) (see Grice, Herbert Paul; Neo-Gricean Pragmatics; Relevance Theory). Clearly, this post-Fregean trend also belongs to the semantic tradition and constitutes, with cognitive linguistics, its empirical development. Notwithstanding the label ‘pragmatics’ that is commonly attached to it, this trend is little more than a branch of empirical semantics, inasmuch as it attempts (as do cognitive linguistics and linguistic functionalism) to relate, if not reduce, the meanings encoded in language (i.e., in lexico-grammar: sentence, clause, phrase; words, clitics, and morphemes) to empirical matters such as function, language use, and understanding. This brand of pragmatics thus excludes such contextual phenomena as cannot be transparently related to propositional meanings or grammatical rules; that is, most human practices, which occur contingently and largely independently of linguistically encoded meanings (cf. Mey, 2001).
In this connection, the following three points are worth observing: (1) the grammarians called ‘generative semanticists,’ such as George Lakoff and James McCawley, found post-Austinean pragmatics useful; (2) Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson’s (neo)-Gricean relevance theory remains a highly abstract account based on a priori assumptions (economy, eufunctionalism, cooperation, and logico-rationalistic computation), while remaining impervious to the contextual and historic contingencies that lie at the heart of matters pragmatic; and finally (3) the current popularity of trends such as relevance theory and cognitive linguistics may be in part due to their eclectic, quasipragmatic, and quasi-semantic character, in line with their emergence at the transitional point where contemporary pragmatics is moving from more semantically oriented theories (such as those of speech acts or generative semantics), which are primarily concerned with linguistically encoded

meanings, toward more robustly pragmatic theories, such as social pragmatics and critical discourse analysis, which are primarily concerned with contingent actual happenings in a sociohistorical context (see Speech Acts; Critical Discourse Analysis; Pragmatics: Overview).
Thus far, we have seen how the two post-Fregean semantic trends have led to cognitive linguistics and pragmatics. In the following discussions, we follow the genealogy of a nonsemantic, yet truly pragmatic tradition, derived not from Frege, but from other neoKantians, such as Peirce, Franz Boas, and Max Weber, and ultimately going back to Kant himself.
The Social-Scientific Tradition of Pragmatics
The genuinely pragmatic tradition, often known as the social sciences, includes anthropology and sociology, the origin of which goes back to Bronislaw Malinowski (1884–1942), Weber (1864–1920), Georg Simmel (1858–1918), Emile Durkheim (1858–1917), Boas (1858–1942), Karl Marx (1818–1883), Alexander Humboldt (1769–1859), and ultimately the Enlightenment philosophers such as the Marquis de Condorcet (1743–1794), Voltaire (1694–1778), and perhaps even the earlier Giambattista Vico (1668–1744). However, the most important figure in the current discussion is Johann Herder (1744–1803), a student of Kant who critically accepted Kant’s critical philosophy and, in doing this, launched a metacritique of the latter, especially of its claim to human (and even ‘anthropological’ – the term is Kant’s own) universality. In Herder’s view, such alleged universality is no more than an ideology, conditioned by the historic, geographic, and cultural (that is, contextual) factors peculiar to the Idealist philosopher Kant and his times, i.e., the modern era of the German (secularized Lutheran) Enlightenment. Note that the idea of metacritique was already contained in Kant’s critical philosophy, which tried to show, at the transcendental (second-order, or meta-) level, the valid limits of all philosophizing, including its own. Herder in turn elaborated on this theme, attacking Kant’s claim to universality by appealing to the cultural diversity of the empirical world(s). Since the validity of such a metacritique can be assessed only by actual investigations into the empirical world, Herder’s move led to the birth of the modern social sciences, especially in Germany, as attested by the works of Marx, Boas, and Weber, in which various eras and cultures were methodically compared. In so doing, these authors interpretively identified the sociohistoric uniqueness and contingent conditions of particular cultures and periods and demonstrated the historic/cultural limits and relativity of modern western thought and its ‘products’

(including the social sciences and their ethnocentric universalism). Such was the underlying theme of Boasian anthropology, to be described shortly, following a brief look at the development of the ‘new’ science of sociology.
In the 19th century, between Kant’s and Durkheim’s times, rapid modernization, urban immigration, and capital formation progressed in England, France, and then Germany, leading to the emergence of social problems such as dire poverty, overpopulation in urban environments, and terrifying labor conditions. As the masses came into being in cities, society became a visible entity, to be investigated through demographic, statistical, and analytical means by reformers in the spirit of Henri de SaintSimon (1760–1825) and scholars such as Auguste Comte (1798–1857) and Durkheim himself, who created a science called ‘social physics’ (which later became sociology) to measure, analyze, and control (i.e., ‘tame’) the social problems. Henceforth, sociology would develop around the two axes of Weberian interpretive, historical sociology (see earlier) and Durkheimian functionalist or statistical macrosociology. However, in the Anglophone world, the latter axis was much stronger, compared to the European continent; this can be seen exemplified in the works of British structural functionalism (social anthropology) and in Talcott Parsons’s (1902–1979) systemic sociology in the United States. Such was the contextual background of what came to be known, on the one hand, as the sociology of language, practiced by scholars such as Joshua Fishman, Charles Ferguson, and others (cf., Giglioli, 1972), and on the other as, Labovian sociolinguistics the latter squarely belonged to the mainstream Anglophone tradition of structuralfunctional sociology, giving preference to macrosocial facts and regularities over interpretations and microsocial, contingent happenings.
In conflict with the latter tradition, the sociologist Erving Goffman (1922–1982) paved the way for a minute descriptive analysis of the dynamics of discourse at the microsocial level, and thus helped to revive the interpretive sociology of Weber, Simmel, Edward Sapir (1884–1939), G. H. Mead (1863– 1931), and the Chicago School of sociology, known for its ethnographic and symbolic-interactional approaches (cf. Blount, 1995). This revival, often called the ‘hermeneutic turn,’ came to put its mark on various social sciences, including cultural anthropology, where Clifford Geertz (1926–2006), in the mid-1970s, successfully criticized the semantic orientation of ethnoscience (see earlier) for its neglect of interpretation and context. Similarly, in sociology, the phenomenological movement developed in the wake of the German sociologist Alfred Schutz’s (1899–1959) works represented a long-awaited

renaissance in ethnomethodology, originally advanced by Harold Garfinkel (b. 1917), who tried to base the entirety of sociology on the microsocial phenomena of lived worlds, especially their everyday interpretations and dynamic contextualization. Yet, the positivist standard of formal rigor and the phobia of interpretive ambiguity in sociology were such that ethnomethodology quickly lost its contextual flexibility, critical reflexivity, and comprehensive scope, and underwent formalization and miniaturization, thus turning into an independent sociological practice, namely, conversation analysis. This school (often thought to be associated with pragmatics) subsequently incorporated some of Goffman’s insights and ideas of post-Fregean pragmatics, as evidenced in Penelope Brown and Stephen Levinson’s types of conversational activity and theories of polite behavior (considered as face-maximizing rational decision-making). These theories, due to their eclectic nature, enjoyed popular acclaim especially during the transitory phase when modern pragmatics moved from the semantic to the social-scientific tradition, i.e., in the late 1970s and early 1980s (see Activity Theory; Face; Politeness).
The preceding discussion outlines a general genealogy of the microsociological theories of pragmatics. Yet, as regards the crux of the social-scientific tradition, which can be said to lie in the exploration of the sociocultural mechanisms by which language contextually indexes power relations, authorities, and identities, it is missing in most of these theories. In contrast, there are Goffman’s microsocial analyses of interaction ritual, frame, and symbolic self-presentation later incorporated into the French sociologist Pierre Bourdieu’s (1930–2002) macrosocial theory of ‘reproduction through habitus,’ the field of practice, and symbolic capital. In Britain’s class-stratified society, Basil Bernstein (1924–2000) also struggled with this problematic, especially when it came to determining the role that language plays in formal education. These three figures thus anticipated the coming of a truly social-scientific kind of pragmatics, i.e., critical pragmatics, as pursued in the 1980s by social semioticians, by Norman Fairclough and his Lancaster School, and others, such as Mey (1985, 2001), whose works share more and more traits with the paradigm elaborated by the anthropological tradition (see Codes, Elaborated and Restricted).
Although the above-mentioned groups have distinct genealogies, networks, and theoretical foci, all of them are nonetheless actively engaged in the social critique of language in education, medicine, and other kinds of controlling social instances; they also share among them many sources of critical inspiration and much theoretical weaponry, including the works of Peirce, Boas, Sapir, Benjamin Whorf, Roman

20 Anthropology and Pragmatics

Jakobson, Dell Hymes, and John Gumperz in North America (see later), as well as the traditions embodied in the writings of Malinowski, J. R. Firth, M. A. K. Halliday, Raymond Williams, E. P. Thompson, and Stuart Hall in Britain; E´ mile Benveniste, Roland Barthes, Louis Althusser, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Gilles Deleuze in France; Marx, Weber, Theodor Adorno, Walter Benjamin, and Ju¨ rgen Habermas in Germany; Antonio Gramsci in Italy; and Mikhail Bakhtin and Valentin Voloshinov in the former Soviet Union. All of these traditions can be seen as unified from a social-scientific perspective, focusing on language use as discourse, i.e., language in social context, and seeing pragmatics, located at the core of language, as praxis, involving social conflicts, power struggles, and identity (re)formations (see Austin, John L.; Foucault, Michel). And, if pragmatics is worthless unless it is concerned with contextualized linguistic practice, that is, with what is done by peoples and individuals living in particular societies and particular times – i.e., not just with ‘what is said’ (linguistic meaning), but with ‘what is done’ in a contextually situated, sociohistorical practice – then a genuine pragmatics must be a social science of praxis, of actions and events in culture, society, and history. Such a pragmatics has been emerging since the 1980s; it erases the disciplinary division between linguistic anthropology and pragmatics and enables seeing classic, post-Austinean pragmatics as a transitory phenomenon in the historic drift moving from the semantic tradition, or the logico-linguistics of decontextualized regularities, toward the genuinely pragmatic social science of contextualized actions and events (see Pragmatic Acts).
In the following sections, we take a genealogical look at the North American ‘cosmographic’ school of linguistic anthropology, starting with Boas, in order to get a better idea of the social-scientific tradition, where, if the current drift continues, the future of pragmatics lies. We start out with Peirce, the neoKantian whose semiotic Pragmati(ci)sm was comprehensive enough to bridge the gap between the Fregean semantic and Boasian anthropological traditions, as witnessed by Jakobson’s (1896–1982) synthesis of the two trends under the rubric of Peircean semiotics (see Jakobson, Roman).
Pragmatics, Pragmati(ci)sm, and the Social Semiotics of Praxis
As is well known, the term ‘pragmatics’ has come from a tradition that is located in between semantics and social science, namely, American Pragmati(ci)sm. In Charles Morris’s (1901–1979) triadic formulation, we speak of syntax (form), semantics (meaning),

and pragmatics (context) – terms that are derived from the semiotic Pragmati(ci)sm of the neo-Kantian Peirce (1839–1914) and thus properly indicate the origin of pragmatics as being located in Kant’s second Critique, or more generally, in the latter’s critical philosophy.
Peirce, who shared much with other neo-Kantians (such as the phenomenologists), articulated what he called a semiotic ‘phaneroscopy’ (phenomenology), in which actions and events constitute the basis of knowledge, aesthetics, and historic evolution (teleology). Most importantly, actions and events are signs that point to objects in context, such as agents (stimuli) and experiencers. Therefore, the basic mode of signification is indexicality, which is based on the principle of contextual contiguity; the other empirically oriented mode of signification, iconicity, is based on the principle of contextual similarity between signs and their objects. In addition, there are empirically unmotivated, albeit contextually indexed and/or iconically signaled, kinds of signs, i.e., symbols; these comprise conventional ideas (ideologies) and denotational codes, as they are presupposed by the speech participants involved in actions and events. These three kinds of signs interact with one another to constitute the human cosmology, as it is anchored on the (inter)actions and events taking place at the hic et nunc of human activity.
Eventually, this cosmographic theory of signs was adopted by Jakobson, who, in his comprehensive theory of communication (cf., Jakobson, 1990; Lee, 1997), articulated the empirical, indexically anchored universal matrix of grammatical categories and distinctive features, envisioned as the systematic interlocking of symbolic (formal and semantic) langue and indexical (phonetic and pragmatic) parole (see Jakobson, Roman). The Jakobsonian legacy successfully integrated Peircean semiotics and Boasian linguistic anthropology; it has been the guiding thread of North American linguistic anthropology ever since, from Hymes’s ethnography of speaking all the way to Michael Silverstein’s social semiotics (cf. Blount, 1995). In the beginning, however, there was Boas, to whom we now turn.
The Genealogy of Linguistic Anthropology: The Boasian Cosmographic Tradition
We now try to reconstruct the cosmographic theories due to Boas, Sapir, and Whorf; these early 20th-century theories have become somewhat obscured by the hegemonic dominance of the semantic tradition in linguistics and anthropology, which gained strength in mid-20th century.

Anthropology and Pragmatics 21

As already noted, like Peirce, Boas was a neo-Kantian who had come to understand the human mind in terms of the three processes of similarity, contiguity, and abstraction, in close resemblance with the Peircean triad of iconicity, indexicality, and symbolicity. Unlike Peirce, however, Boas was a social scientist who fought evolutionism and institutionalized racism. In these efforts, he undertook the task of showing the existence of grammatical structures in every known language, especially (Native) American languages, and used his findings to prove the universality of a symbolic ‘‘faculty of forming abstract ideas’’ (Blount, 1995: 26), common to all human beings. In the process, Boas moved on to empirical studies of diverse languages in a universal framework, including hypothetical universal grammar.
Boas came close to discovering the notion of the phoneme, which harkens back, via the German Vo¨ lkerpsychologen such as Heymann Steinthal (1823– 1899), to Wilhelm von Humboldt’s (1767–1835) idea of innere Sprachform and, ultimately, to Kant’s notion of ‘the inner and formative power of life forms,’ as he articulated it in his third Critique. Coming to the cultural, idiographic, or cosmographic sciences (in the sense of Alexander Humboldt) such as geography, anthropology, and linguistics, from a background in nomothetic sciences such as (psycho)physics and experimental psychology (cf., Stocking, 1996: 9–16), Boas was naturally impressed by the diversity of human phenomena he observed in culturally and historically situated contexts. He saw the two kinds of sciences as being connected via the faculty of categorical perception, i.e., the human capacity and tendency to impose categorical forms (such as sound patterns) on empirical substance or diverse unique (idiographic) phenomena (such as phones and sensations). In this, Boas anticipated 20th-century structuralism, phenomenology, and Gestalt psychology, and their practitioners, whose battle-cry against 19th-century positivists’ preoccupation with sensations was precisely ‘the primacy of (categorical) human (ap)perception.’ Moreover, and perhaps more importantly, Boas (as did the later structuralists) maintained that linguistic perceptions were decisively conditioned by the unconscious structure of the mind; moreover, this unconscious structure could, no less importantly, be rigorously investigated using a set of techniques not uncritically adopted from the physical sciences, in what came to be called ‘structural analysis’ (cf., Boas, 1989: 72–77; Sapir, 1949: 166).
Boas understood categorical phonemic perception essentially as a linguistic, structurally and unconsciously conditioned distortion in the conscious perception of phonetic and pragmatic (i.e., empirical) phenomena. In his critique of logico-linguistic reason (of the kind earlier articulated by Herder and

Max Mu¨ ller (1823–1900), and later by Ludwig Wittgenstein (1889–1951)), Boas made a critical empiricist departure from the Cartesian understanding of the mind, centered around the conscious reflection that rationalists considered to be the key to reality and verity. Boas stressed the value of empirical data (i.e., phonetic representations and unadulterated texts), gathered through fieldwork, as being critically important to his effort to show the relativistic plurality of cultures and the invalidity of the a priori armchair theories of Eurocentric universalism and rationalism, especially evolutionism (cf., Stocking, 1982: 195–233, 1996: 215–256).
Boas indeed was able to show that similar processes of rationalization underlay both evolutionist reasoning and what was called the primitive, ‘savage mind’ (cf., Le´vi-Strauss, 1962), and hypothesized that such pragmatic processes of conscious rationalization (as opposed to universally valid, logico-semantic reason) were similar across diverse cultures, although their specific contents (which could be empirically investigated through the study of cultural myths and folklore, including modern sciences and philosophy) varied cross-culturally and showed distinct, so-called ‘geniuses’ of peoples. Thus, Boas, as Marx had done before him, understood theoretical reason and consciousness as a veil, or a mirror that produced distorted reflections of empirical phenomena such as cultural practices. For Boas, conscious behaviors distort and change these practices, which are otherwise unconsciously and habitually carried out and historically preserved. It is in this context that Boas underlined the methodological significance of linguistic structure, a largely unconscious phenomenon, which was assumed to provide a crucial key to the historical reconstruction of past practices (see Blount, 1995: 23–26; cf., Sapir, 1949: 432–433; Silverstein, 1979).
It may be useful to further unfold Boas’s argument, in particular as it was later elaborated by Sapir (1949: 26–27, 156). First, both conscious and unconscious elements of the human mind are theorized as essentially reactive in relation to the sociohistorical practices (pragmatics) that are represented by, and give rise to, them. Yet, the agentive awareness (consciousness) of practices is limited, and when human agents act in accordance with such limited and distorted awareness, they precipitate the transformation of these very practices, and history starts unfolding (in Weberian terms, this is the dialectics between conscious ideology, such as Protestant ethic, and actual practice, such as capital formation and labor). On the other hand, the unconscious mind, which comprises linguistic structure, more transparently reflects human practices (at time t0); but, since practices quickly change, along with consciousness, in a dialectic movement, the unconscious is left

22 Anthropology and Pragmatics

behind (at time t1), and the correspondence with synchronic practices (at t1) becomes opaque, even though it remains more transparently related to the diachronically prior practices (at t0). Therefore, both consciousness and the unconscious (where linguistic structure is mostly located) end up being only opaquely related to synchronic practices. Thus, for Boas and his followers, ‘synchronic structure’ is both synchronic (inasmuch as it is used ‘here and now’) and diachronic (inasmuch as it points to past practices). This synchrony is made up of both static and dynamic facets, the former (i.e., linguistic structure) relatively transparently pointing to the past and the latter being ‘where the action is’ (viz., pragmatics and phonetics); the Weberian dialectic interaction between the two, contingently creates the historic conditions for the structures and actions that are yet to come (see Phonetics and Pragmatics). Thus, the discovery of the phoneme (and of linguistic structure in general) was directly linked to the rebuttal of 19th-century neogrammarians’ genetico-causal determinism (itself a further derivate of the Newtonian– Laplacean deterministic worldview), according to which the posterior condition is mechanically determined by the anterior, and faultlessly derivable from it. The discovery of synchrony (vs. achrony) also was instrumental in Saussure’s discovery of the historic dialectics of langue and parole, as noted by the dialectician Maurice Merleau-Ponty (1908–1961), who properly stressed the importance of the latter’s discovery of parole (and, implicitly, of pragmatics).
No less important, given the opacity between structure and practice in the synchronic phase, is the following corollary: from the preceding premises, it deducibly follows that phonetic acts do not transparently match the phonemic categories they correspond to – a mismatch that provides part of the conditions ‘distorting’ phonemic apperceptions. Similarly, pragmatic acts (say, commands) do not uniquely match grammatical categories (say, the imperative mood, as becomes clear when we study the so-called indirect speech acts) (see Pragmatic Acts). In other words, the irreducibility of linguistic structure to pragmatics, a phenomenon that Chomsky sees as having its origin in the human innate faculty of reason, is shown to be deducible as a consequence of historical dialectics, generated by the very limits of consciousness or reason (cf., Sapir, 1949: 100–103). Further, just as phonetic phenomena are misperceived through our unconscious phonemic patterning (which escapes reason), pragmatic practices and referents are often incorrectly apperceived by the native mind due to an unconscious grammatical patterning (that is, due to the language-specific structural pattern found to exist in the morphosyntactic encoding of grammatical categories) (see Speech Acts and Grammar).

This is the crux of the argument that has come to be known as the linguistic relativity hypothesis (cf., Blount, 1995: 26–28; Cowan et al., 1986: 455– 477; Whorf, 1956: 134–159) (see Sapir, Edward; Whorf, Benjamin Lee).
Examining the linguistic relativity hypothesis requires us to undertake empirical studies of linguistic structures and practices across languages and cultures, which again necessitates the hypothetical construction of universal inventories of structurally significant sounds and grammatical categories (as these indeed were presented by Boas (1911)). Clearly, the typological works of Sapir (1921) and Whorf (1956: 87–101) – as well as Jakobson’s (1990) theories of distinctive features and verbal categories, which may be marked ‘overtly’ or ‘covertly’ (Whorf, 1956: 87–101) in particular languages – were further elaborations of this non-Eurocentric ‘universal grammar,’ based on emically significant categories in the languages of the world, and suggesting the possible existence of a universal human reality underlying the particular worlds of diverse cultures (cf., Sapir, 1949: 160–166; Whorf, 1956: 147, 207–232).
The basic framework of the Boasian cosmographic tradition, as it was shared by Sapir and Whorf, became the context in which Sapir’s twin notions of drift and psychological reality are to be understood. That is, in contradistinction to the neogrammarians’ mechanical, genetico-causal ‘blind change,’ drift, vaguely and holistically perceived as Sprachgefu¨ hl, refers to historical structural changes caused by the dialectic interaction between structure, language use, nonlinguistic practice, and metalinguistic rationalization. Sapir, a social scientist, understood that ideal patterns (Sapir, 1921: 147; 1949: 23, 83–88, 533–543) in structure were necessarily realized not in their pure forms, but in contextualized and varied, i.e., idio-, dia-, and sociolectal, form-tokens. Some of these variations may become saliently socialindexical and directly involved in the social struggles for cultural hegemonies, as well as in processes of normative rationalizations. In such cases, the interaction between language and society often results in structural changes (cf., Blount, 1995: 513–550). Also, some of the variations may become privileged when language users feel they are being formally correct, that is, actualizing potential regularities implicitly suggested by the synchronic state of language. In such a case, the variations analogically deducible from the structure’s dominant pattern may become part of the structure that will arise from the interaction between language and the Sprachgefu¨ hl of the language users (cf., Sapir, 1921: 147–191; Whorf, 1956: 134–159; Lucy, 1992). (Sapir hypothesized in addition that such analogies were drawn and actually

Anthropology and Pragmatics 23

implemented because of unconscious human strivings for formal beauty; on this, see below.)
Sapir’s (1949: 16, 33–60) ‘psychological reality’ may be similarly reconstructed in the following way. Sapir (1949: 433) started out from the Boasian thesis that linguistic consciousness was opaque to practices, partly because it was influenced by unconscious structural (sound) patterns. This implies, Sapir noted, that there is some transparent linkage between consciousness and ‘inner forms’ (the sound patterns). Of course, native language users cannot consciously articulate the structure of their language, but they can ‘feel,’ half- or sub-consciously, such inner forms, which are beyond the realm of phonetic behaviors directly perceived by outsiders of the linguistic community. In other words, native language users (insiders) ‘click with’ (Sapir, 1949: 48, 159) the linguistic structure at the intersection of their consciousness and unconscious, i.e., at the level of feelings. And such an inarticulate, yet immediately sensed Sprachgefu¨ hl, and with it, the unconscious structural patterns, are manifested even in overt linguistic behaviors such as the categorical apperceptions of sounds, actions, and referents (cf., Sapir, 1921: 55, 1949: 46– 60, 150–159; Whorf, 1956: 134–159). These attested behaviors would remain unexplained if it were not for the phenomenological reality of the phoneme and other form-patterns in the unconscious. Moreover, Sapir noted that allophones of a phoneme often historically developed into different phonemes. In his view, this meant that phonemic inner forms often transparently correspond to the historically reconstructed phonetic (allophonic) behaviors of users in the past (cf., Cowan et al., 1986: 67–106). In this way, the linguistic history of a community was discovered to be alive (phenomenologically, psychologically real, or ‘organic’) in the Sprachgefu¨ hl and innermost unconscious of the language users. The individual mind, in short, is communal and historical in its subconscious core. Hence, Sapir noted, there is no need to oppose the individual to the social (collective), to hypostatize a ‘super-organic’ collectivity existing independently of individuals, or to reify culture or language.
In Sapir’s cosmographic theory, the psychological reality had other important implications for the cultural nature of the human mind. That is, unconscious, historical, and communal symbolic forms are ideologically projected onto the chaotic reality of discursive practices, precipitating the chaotic, rhapsodic, and romantic ‘‘flux of things into tangible forms, beautiful and sufficient to themselves’’ (Sapir, 1949: 348), as they are found in poetically structured discursive texts and rituals. In and by themselves,

the symbolic forms constitute an artwork of classicism, often referred to as ‘the poetry of grammar,’ created by the human striving for an aesthetic totality, un syste`me ou` tout se tient (compare the notion of drift, referred to previously) (cf., Sapir, 1949: 344; Cowan et al., 1986: 455–477; also consider Jakobson’s (1990) ‘poetic function’). Thus, in Sapir’s view, the very regularity of linguistic structure – a regularity necessary in order to operate with decontextualized denotational and cognitive significations – is constituted by our aesthetic, expressive, and ideological strivings for formal completeness. Cognition, aesthetics, emotion, history, society, and the individual are thus intertwined in Sapir’s cosmographic theory.
Unfortunately, the inroads made during the 1940s and 1950s by the semantic tradition into the sciences of language almost altogether eclipsed Sapir’s cosmographic science, except in the narrow circle of linguistic anthropologists. This process started with the neo-Bloomfieldians, to be followed by the ethnoscientists in anthropology, the Chomskyans in (psycho)linguistics, and the cognitive scientists of diverse obediences, who all operated in this tradition. Nevertheless, Sapir’s students, such as Stanley Newman (1905–1984) and Mary Haas (1910–1996), successfully passed the torch to the next generation, whose representatives included John Gumperz and Dell Hymes, who succeeded in firmly integrating the Boasian and Peircean–Jakobsonian (semiotic) approaches (cf., Gumperz and Hymes, 1986). Subsequently, Hymes’s theory of communication, called the ‘ethnography of speaking,’ gained momentum in the 1970s (cf., Bauman and Sherzer, 1974), a decade that saw the hermeneutic (i.e., interpretive, contextual, or (neo-)pragmatic) turn in the social sciences and Anglophone philosophy (as pointed out previously). This turn provided the historic conditions for a revival of the Boasian tradition in contemporary North American linguistic anthropology, locating language squarely at the intersection of history, ideology, and practice (see Blount, 1995; Brenneis and Macaulay, 1996; Duranti, 2001; Kroskrity, 2000; Lee, 1997; Lucy, 1992, 1993; Schieffelin et al., 1998; Silverstein and Urban, 1996). Here, the historic, ideological, and pragmatic aspects of language, including not only grammar, but also (con)textualization, language change and variation, Bakhtinian voicing, standardization, rationalization, modernization, linguistic nationalism and imperialism, language purism, feminism and gender, literalism, and other cultural ideologies and practices, seen in their sociohistoric context, are cosmographically studied in a social-scientific framework. Their discovery of the (re)formations of group identities and

power relations and sociocultural conflicts as happening in, and being constituted by, language as the central element thus converges with the social drift of contemporary critical pragmatics.

Applying Pragmatics

The term ‘applying pragmatics’ (AP) is coined in this entry in preference to ‘applied pragmatics’ to signal that AP is a dynamic, user-oriented activity. With a wide and evolving range of applications in the societal context, AP contrasts with the somewhat fossilized term ‘applied linguistics’, which is primarily associated with (foreign) language learning and

teaching, although it does cover linguistic applications in other areas, such as speech pathology, translation, and lexicography. Applied pragmatics embraces practices rooted in a pragmatic perspective on language users, language use, and contexts of use, where the users and their complex of personal, social, cultural, and ideational contexts are seen as paramount. If pragmatics itself is a ‘user-oriented science of language’, AP is a problem-solving activity with an emphasis on using pragmatic knowledge critically, imaginatively, and constructively in the real-world context of the ‘social struggle’, rather than on

Applying Pragmatics 25

rehearsing the tenets of canonical pragmatic theory (Mey, 2001: 308–319).
The relevance of pragmatics for the wider social agenda at the micro- and macro-levels of operation can be attributed in part to a series of developmental and formative tendencies: a concerted reaction to the syntactic formalism of Chomskyan linguistics and the preoccupation with language as system, where the language user and contexts of language use are disenfranchised; a ‘social-critical’ impetus, fueled by the desire to create a socially sensitive practice of language, typified for instance by the work of Basil Bernstein and the critical distinction he drew between restricted and elaborated code; a unique perspective on language as action and speech act theory, initiated by the work of J. L. Austin and the work of ‘ordinary language philosophers’; and a perspective on language as communication rather than on language as grammar, deriving from the ethnomethodological tradition (Mey, 1998: 716) (see Codes, Elaborated and Restricted; Austin, John L.).
Levels of Application: Micro- and Macro-processes
Applying pragmatics operates at both the micro- and macro-levels of communication, although this distinction is approximate and more of a labeling convenience, since the two levels interpenetrate and synergize. ‘Micro-pragmatics’ looks at the day-to-day context of communication between individuals and groups situated in their local contexts. At the same time, local practices need to be seen against the societal backgrounds and institutional settings in which they occur (i.e., ‘macro-pragmatics’). Micro- and macro-pragmatics are points in a continuum, each linking to the other and each serving as the focus according to the aim of the enquiry. Verschueren (1999: 220–224) cites Goodwin’s (1994) analysis of the Rodney King trials as a case in point. While being arrested for a traffic violation in Los Angeles, King, an African-American, was subjected to a violent beating by police officers – an event that was filmed by an amateur video photographer and later broadcast on public television to public outrage. The police officers were subsequently put on trial and later acquitted. This led to street riots in Los Angeles and a subsequent retrial. As a communicative event, the courtroom proceedings can only be properly understood in relation to the macro-setting created by the institutional and social contexts in which they took place and through which they were mediated: the particular structure and participant roles and the associated verbal processes typical of the (U.S.) courtroom and a legal/trial setting; the actual and perceived social status of African-Americans within

American society, as embodied by King at the time and subsequently; and the role of community and civil rights leaders and their adoption of the King case as a heuristic to draw attention to racism and police brutality. Thus, transcriptions of the trial process can be initially approached as instances of face-to-face linguistic interaction in a courtroom setting, but as the tale unfolds, the total event and its wide-reaching implications can only be properly understood in terms of how (U.S.) legal institutions reflect, endorse, and perpetuate particular societal practices and values.
Domains of Application: Micro- and Macro-pragmatics
As a perspective rather than a component of a linguistic theory, pragmatics can purposefully be applied in the investigation of all instances of language use, whether at the level of the individual, the group, the institution, or society as a whole, and whether at the level of the sentence/utterance or in relation to extended discourse (Verschueren, 1999: 203; Mey, 1998: 728). With its focus on the sentence/utterance level of discourse, micro-pragmatics is concerned primarily with the local constraints of the immediate context, such as: deixis and the indexing of personal, temporal, and locative features; reference and the textually directive function of anaphora and cataphora; and word order and the sequencing/clustering of particles and their discourse function to modify illocutionary force, to facilitate the management of conversation, or to highlight salient parts in a stretch of discourse (see Deixis and Anaphora: Pragmatic Approaches; Discourse Anaphora; Discourse Markers). Yet, rooted as these linguistic features are in the immediate surroundings of an utterance, the link with the world becomes apparent as the focus shifts from the individual to the wider, institutionally and societally driven contexts in which humankind must necessarily operate. To quote Mey (2001: 177):
The world in which people live is a coherent one, in which everything hangs together: none of its phenomena can be explained in isolation.
This is now the domain of macro-pragmatics. Institutional and institutionalized language practices figure prominently on the agenda (and often), where power asymmetries may arise as the result of gender difference, perceived social standing and social privilege, and (lack of) access to power. Typical research areas and domains of application include: medical discourse and the study of language use in doctorpatient interviews, psychoanalysis, and schizophrenic discourse; educational and pedagogical language practices, such as teacher-student interaction, language

acquisition and the development of pragmatic competence, the articulation of language policy in relation to minority language instruction, wording of the learning/ teaching curriculum, and, more generally, the sets of attitudes and beliefs propagated through the ‘hidden curriculum’; the language of the workplace and its impact on management-worker relations; the language of the media, especially advertising discourse; the language of politics, government, and ideology, viewed as a force for linguistic manipulation and the engineering of human minds; and intercultural and international communication and the (lack of) understanding of cultural and communicative diversity, where what is pragmatically appropriate in the given context is at issue. In short, macro-pragmatics considers language use in terms of the totality of contexts in which the unique, dynamic, human activity of verbal communication takes place. It takes its cues from a variety of other related disciplines, such as (linguistic) anthropology, sociology, ethnology, and linguistic science itself. (see Institutional Talk; Media and Language: Overview; Intercultural Pragmatics and Communication; Social Aspects of Pragmatics; Language Politics.)
Applying Pragmatics and the Language User
Applying pragmatics aims to develop an awareness of the crucial role that language plays in the construction of individual, group, and societal identities and the consequences of these ‘constructed identities’ for individual freedoms and the rights of individuals to participate fully in the communities of which they are a part. Exploration of the macro-context, in relation to which all language activity takes place, is the province of ‘societal pragmatics’, with its unique focus on the users of language and the prevailing conditions under which they use language. Applying pragmatics highlights problems of language use that arise in social contexts where the failure to communicate successfully may lead to social exclusion and disadvantage (see Social Aspects of Pragmatics).
The domain of education is often singled out as the main sphere of human activity in which social privilege and access to power are unevenly distributed. Education is mediated and perpetuated through language. Any departure from institutionally identified standards of linguistic behavior is stigmatized and faces sanction. Hence, talk of linguistic oppression may take place, as evidenced, for instance, by the opposition between ‘low’ and ‘high’ prestige dialects. The latter can be associated with the linguistic standards whose observance is dictated for wider use by a minority but dominant class of language user. This language oppression is nothing

less than social control through language. The insights provided by AP enable us to develop an awareness of the insidious effects of language repression while calling for greater transparency in how society deals with the individual’s linguistic behavior in the educational setting (Mey, 1998: 731–732) (see Power and Pragmatics).
Societal pragmatics is also concerned with other social contexts in which linguistic repression is at work and where individuals behave unwittingly, in a certain way, on account of an institutionalized power imbalance. Medical discourse and the instance of schizophrenic speech are a further case in point. Schizophrenic speech is associated with abnormal language. Such speech impoverishment represents a loss of humanness, because the ‘nonlanguage’ of the schizophrenic, as it is now defined, has become a symptom rather than a means of communication and thus a target for psychiatric manipulation and intervention. By raising questions about the nature of interactive norms in medical practice, AP can argue the need for informed intervention, where the relationships between humanness, language use, sanity, and institutional power are placed under public scrutiny.
Matters of linguistic diversity and endangered languages are also fertile territory for pragmatic intervention. Language attrition, language loss, and language death are all issues on the pragmatic agenda, where description is seen only as an initial step to corrective action rather than as an end in itself (see Minorities and Language; Endangered Languages). Notwithstanding controversies over the global, cultural, political, and historical impact of English on smaller indigenous languages, AP can raise public awareness, help collate data, monitor linguistic policies and practices, seek to influence policymakers, and offer practical and professional support to speech communities actively wishing to preserve their languages. For instance, the Linguistic Society of America records that active intervention in this manner, as opposed to mere description and documentation, has shown highly promising results. Its website records that:
Language loss is [often] far more directly a consequence of intolerance for diversity [than an inevitable result of progress], particularly when practiced by the powerful against the weak.
Applying Pragmatics and the Social Struggle
Applying pragmatics is explicitly concerned with situating the concerns of societal pragmatics in terms of a broad social-political agenda; it is interventionist rather than descriptive in its primary aims. Applying pragmatics is all about doing pragmatics. As a case in

Austin, John L. 27

point, Mey (2001: 313–315) cites the success of the linguistic war against sexism and the now mostly abandoned use of generic pronoun he as a modest yet significant victory for nonsexist practice. Uprooting the hegemonic he is not just linguistic tinkering; it brings about a restructuring of stated social relationships, thereby facilitating gender equality (see Gender and Language).
Applying pragmatics shares common concerns with critical linguistics, whose aim is to expose the hidden relationships between social power and language use, against the backdrop of sociopolitical and cultural factors. Case studies include: political discourse, specifically the cliche´d rhetoric of Britain’s political parties; the language of labor disputes and their documentation in the media; the use of more critically aware pedagogies in (English) second-language teaching; and the characterization of social power as a given or natural phenomenon, legitimized through unquestioning acceptance by the public (see Media and Language: Overview).
Applying pragmatics has a crucial, empowering, and emancipatory role to play. It helps us understand the power of language to discriminate indiscriminately across a range of social contexts; it suggests an agenda for pragmatically informed intervention on behalf of the disenfranchised, underprivileged language user; and, last, it seeks to put language in the hands of the language user, wresting linguistic control from those who would undermine and deny the rights and freedoms of the individual (see Pragmatics: Overview; Marxist Theories of Language).

Austin was born on March 26, 1911 in Lancaster. After studying philosophy in Shrewsbury and Oxford,

he became fellow of All Souls College (1933) and later professor in Magdalen College at Oxford University, where he remained until his premature death on February 8, 1960. Although he was ‘White’s Professor of Moral Philosophy,’ Austin is especially known for his contribution to linguistic philosophy and for his very personal use of ordinary language philosophy,

28 Austin, John L.

which he applied to fundamental issues such as meaning, free will, knowledge, truth, and other minds.
Austin was averse to theory building; he was fascinated by the analytical method of lexicographers, which he used for the study of how words and phrases are used in statements about reality, in the expression of beliefs and intentions, and in all types of conventional talk. Good examples of his philosophical use of the lexicographical approach can be found in his Philosophical papers and in Sense and sensibilia (in the latter work the foundations of British logical positivism are subjected to thorough criticism).
Austin’s lasting contribution to the philosophy of language and to linguistic theory (especially pragmatics) lies in having initiated what later (through the work of his student John Searle) was to become the theory of speech acts. The starting point was Austin’s observation (dating back to the 1940s) that there are two essentially different types of utterances: utterances that say how things are (or say what is the matter), and utterances that, merely by being made, bring about something (a ‘new reality’). Austin called the former type ‘constative’ utterances (The book is on the table), and the latter type ‘performative’ utterances (I baptize you Charles). Whereas constative utterances are (primarily) judged on their truth/falsity, performative utterances are judged on their felicity/infelicity: their (non)success depends not on what the world is like (precisely because they bring about a new fact), but on felicity conditions, such as: appropriate context, authority and sincerity of the speaker, and the existence of certain (cultural) conventions. This distinction, which is the starting point of the William James Lectures given at Harvard University in 1955 (on ‘Words and Deeds’), posthumously published as How to Do Things with Words, was then questioned by Austin himself, and replaced, in the course of the lectures, with a larger view on types of utterances, coupled with (semantic-pragmatic) types of verbs and with types of communicative strategies and effects. The final distinction is then one between acts (it would be better to speak of features of linguistic acts, or of power potentials or forces of acts):

Austin speaks of locutionary act (act of saying something, with a particular sense and reference), illocutionary act (performing an act – such as warning or accusing – in saying something), and perlocutionary act (the act – such as frightening or offending the interlocutor – achieved by saying something). As different people may react differently (some are frightened when being warned, others not), the nexus between the perlocutionary force (as yielding an effect in the hearer) and the two other forces is of a non-conventional nature.
Austin did not organize these ideas into a systematic theory, nor did he live long enough to answer the objections soon made to the published version of his lectures, which shows the evolution in his approach of ‘words and deeds’ and ends with a number of open questions. Thus it was all the more important that Searle turned Austin’s gradually revised approach into a comprehensive speech act theory.

Bakhtin, Mikhail Mikhailovich
S O’Neill, University of Oklahoma, Norman, OK, USA

Mikhail Mikhailovich Bakhtin was born in Orel, Russia, south of Moscow, on November 16, 1895. Coming of age in turbulent times, he attended Saint Petersburg University between 1916 and 1918, dividing his time between classics, literature, and philosophy, while maintaining a keen interest in language outside the classroom. During the 1920s Bakhtin came into contact with Voloshinov and Medvedev, two fellow intellectuals who shared his broad interests in language, politics, dialogue, and literature. Later known as the Bakhtin Circle, these young writers met regularly to discuss the philosophy of language until 1929, when Bakhtin was arrested, detained, and later exiled to Kustanai in 1930. After working as a bookkeeper on a collective farm, Bakhtin traveled to Saransk in 1936 to accept a position at the Mordovia Pedagogical Institute, where he taught Russian and world literature until his retirement in 1961. In 1940, Bakhtin submitted his dissertation, Rabelais and the history of realism, to the Institute of World Literature in Moscow, for which he was awarded the lesser degree of Candidate of Philological Sciences in 1952, rather than the doctorate. Although Bakhtin was a humble scholar who received little public recognition during his lifetime, his ideas have had an enormous, global impact on the philosophy and sociology of language. Bakhtin died in Moscow, Russia, on March 7, 1975.
Bakhtin is best known for his work on dialogue, a concept he continued to develop over the course of his career. For Bakhtin, dialogue was the central reality of language, a position partly inspired by the Greek philosopher Socrates, who stressed the emergent nature of truth in dialogic exchanges between opposing parties. In Bakhtin’s estimation, the most productive exchanges occur between parties that enter into a discussion with contrasting points of view, allowing for change and diversity in society. Bakhtin hinted at this position in his first major publication, Problems of Dostoevsky’s poetics (1929), in which he praised Dostoevsky for writing ‘polyphonic’

novels that represent the many competing voices found in every society. Because these voices resonate with larger systems of thought, such political orientations or even scientific worldviews, Bakhtin maintained that ideology, or perspective, is pervasive in everyday language use.
The political implications of dialogue are greatly expanded in Bakhtin’s later writings. In The dialogic imagination (1981), he identified two major trends on the ideological plane. One tendency is toward homogeneity, where ‘centripetal’ forces seek to centralize the perspectives, discourses, or linguistic varieties found in society, reducing diversity and the possibility of change. Taken to an extreme, this monologic tendency leads to the death of dialogue, a fearful possibility that Bakhtin personally experienced under Stalin’s regime. Fortunately, other ‘centrifugal’ forces are at work, destabilizing meaning by promoting diversity within society, whether as competing discourses or contrasting linguistic varieties. Here Bakhtin offered one of his most important concepts, that of ‘heteroglossia,’ where these competing centripetal and centrifugal forces enter into ongoing conflict, potentially sustaining internal diversity within a speech community, as separate but intermingling genres, registers, sociolects, discourses, and ideologies. In Rabelais and his world (1965), Bakhtin offered the telling image of the medieval carnival, where unofficial discourses and genres flourished, subversively contesting the centripetal forces of official hegemony.

Introduction
The term bilingual education has multiple meanings, with varying positive and negative associations, and a varied history. Take three cases. First, bilingual education is loosely used to refer to schools attended by bilingual children (e.g., Latinos and Latvians in U.S. schools, Greek and Gujarati children in U.K. schools). However, bilingualism is not fostered in such schools. Rather, the aim is to shift the child rapidly from the home, minority language to the dominant, majority language. Second, the term refers to children who are allowed to use their home language in the classroom for only a short period (e.g., one or two years) until they switch to the majority language (called transitional bilingual education). Third, bilingual education appears a more appropriate label for schools in which students learn through two languages in the classroom. For example, there are dual language schools in the United States that teach students through Spanish for one day and the next day through English. In Europe, there are elite bilingual programs (e.g., Luxembourg, Switzerland) in which children both learn, and learn through two or more prestigious languages (e.g., German, French, English).
Types of Bilingual Education
Given that bilingual education has multiple meanings, some clarity is possible by defining different types of bilingual education. Although Baker (2001) and

Garcia (1997), respectively, define 10 and 14 different types of bilingual education, a threefold categorization is helpful.
1. ‘Null’ forms of bilingual education bring together bilingual children but with the aim of monolingualism in the majority language. Submersion education is the term used in academic writing for such education, but not by school systems that tend to use the term mainstreaming. Submersion education implies that the child (on immediate entry to school) only experiences the majority language. The child is thrown into a language at the deep end and are expected to sink or swim in the majority language from the first day.
2. ‘Weak’ forms of bilingual education allow children to use their home language for a temporary period until they can switch totally to the majority language (Carrasquillo and Rodriguez, 2002). Weak forms of bilingual education include structured immersion, withdrawal classes, various forms of sheltered English, transitional bilingual education, and mainstreaming with foreign language teaching. Second language and foreign language teaching in schools occasionally produces competent bilinguals. Generally, such teaching does not result in age-appropriate proficiency in the second or foreign language, nor reaches a level of language that enables learning of curriculum content to occur via that language. Sometimes, a subset of language abilities is developed for instrumental or practical reasons (e.g., travel, trade, cultural awareness).

Bilingual Education 31

3. ‘Strong’ forms of bilingual education aim for each child, irrespective of ability, to achieve bilingualism, biliteracy, and cultural pluralism. Such outcomes are gained mainly through students learning content (e.g., mathematics, social studies) through both languages. Strong forms of bilingual education include U.S. dual language schools, Heritage Language programs, Canadian Immersion, and the European Schools movement. Three of these strong forms of bilingual education will be discussed here, so as to define education that has bilingualism as an educational outcome rather than bilingual children as an input.
Immersion Bilingual Education
Immersion education typically has students from majority language backgrounds (e.g., English homes in Canada; Swedish homes in Finland) and teaches them through another majority or a minority language (e.g., French in Canada). However, there are many variations: first, the age at which a child commences the experience. This may be at the kindergarten or infant stage (early immersion), at 9 to 10 years old (delayed or middle immersion), or at secondary level (late or late-start immersion). Second, the amount of time spent in immersion. Total immersion usually commences with 100% immersion in the second language, reducing after 2 or 3 years to 80% per week for the next 3 or 4 years, finishing junior schooling with approximately 50% immersion in the second language per week. Partial immersion provides close to 50% immersion in the second language throughout infant and junior schooling.
Children in early immersion are usually allowed to use their home language for a year or more for classroom communication. There is no compulsion to speak the second (school) language in the playground or when eating lunch. The child’s home language is valued and not disparaged. Such children also start immersion education with relatively homogeneous language skills. This not only simplifies the teacher’s task, it also means that students’ self-esteem and classroom motivation are not threatened because of some students being linguistically more advanced.
Heritage Language Bilingual Education
Heritage language bilingual education occurs when language minority children use their native, ethnic, home, or heritage language in the school as a medium of instruction and the goal is competence in two languages. Examples include education through, or more often partly through, the medium of Navajo or Spanish in the United States (Francis and Reyhner, 2002), or Basque in Spain (Gardner, 2000),

or aboriginal languages in Australia (Caldwell and Berthold, 1995). In China, since 1979 minority language education has been provided for over 20 minority groups, partly as a way of improving ethnic minority relationships with central government (Blachford, 1997). In the Canadian provinces of Manitoba, British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Alberta, there are heritage language bilingual education programs. The heritage language is the medium of instruction for about 50% of the day (e.g., Ukrainian, Italian, German, Hebrew, Yiddish, Mandarin Chinese, Arabic, and Polish). Heritage language programs in the United States (see Krashen et al., 1998) and elsewhere vary in structure and content and overlap with the 90:10 model of dual language education (see later). Some of the likely features are described here.
Most of the children come from language minority homes but may be joined by a small number of majority language children whose parents desire bilingualism in their children. Such parents will often have the choice of sending their children to mainstream schools or to heritage language programs. In most cases, the majority language will also be used in the curriculum, ranging from second language lessons to a varying proportion (e.g., 10% to 50%) of the curriculum being taught in the majority language. There is a tendency to teach mathematical, technological, and scientific studies through the majority language, and to use the majority language progressively more across the grades.
Where a minority language is used for a majority of classroom time (e.g., 80% to almost 100%), the justification is that children easily transfer ideas, concepts, skills and knowledge into the majority language. Having taught a child multiplication in Mohawkian, this mathematical concept does not have to be retaught in English. The justification given for such programs is also that a minority language is easily lost, a majority language is easily gained. Children tend to be surrounded by the majority language, especially in the teenage years. Thus, bilingualism is achieved by an initial concentration on the minority language at school.
Dual Language Bilingual Education
U.S. dual language (or two-way) bilingual education typically occurs when there is an approximate balance in numbers between language minority and language majority students in the same classroom. Whereas a 50:50 language balance often was advised, the majority language can become dominant (e.g., because of its higher prestige value), putting the aim of bilingualism and biliteracy at risk.
Both languages are used for instruction and learning, revealing that the aim is to produce students

32 Bilingual Education

who are bilingual, biliterate, and bicultural or multicultural (Lindholm-Leary, 2001). Dual language schools use a non-English language for at least 50% of curriculum time for up to six grades. In each period of instruction, only one language is used, such that students learn a new language mostly via content. Genesee and Ga´ ndara (1999) suggest that such schools enhance intergroup communication and cultural awareness. They produce children who, in terms of intergroup relations, are likely to be more tolerant and sensitive. ‘‘Contact between members of different groups leads to increased liking and respect for members of the outgroup, including presumably reductions in stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination’’ (Genesee and Ga´ ndara, 1999: 667).
Some teachers use both languages on different occasions with their students; others just use one language and may be paired and work together closely as a team. The school ethos also will be bilingual by classroom and corridor displays, curriculum resources, announcements, and extracurricular activity using both languages if possible.
A central idea in dual language bilingual schools is language separation and language boundaries. Language boundaries are established in terms of time, curriculum content and teaching. One frequent preference is for each language to be used on alternate days. Alternately, different lessons may use different languages with a regular change over to ensure both languages are used in all curricula areas. The division of time may be in half days, whole days, or alternate weeks. The essential element is the distribution of time to achieve bilingual and biliterate students. Often, a 50:50 balance in use of languages is attempted in early grades, although in some schools, the minority language is given more time (60% to 90% of the available time). In the later years of schooling, there is sometimes a preference for more emphasis on the majority language.
Bilingual Education and Politics
There is no deep understanding of bilingual education except through understanding the politics behind such education. There are varying philosophical and political origins to bilingual education that underpin different models of bilingual education. For example, bilingual education is best understood by reference to national variations (Cummins and Corson, 1998). The contrasting politics of Canada’s two language solitudes and South Africa’s management of social integration when retaining multilingualism, the ardor of language activists in the Basque Country and the more gentle revolution in Wales, the suppression of Breton in France, and the

historical repression of Native American Indian languages in the United States illustrate that the history and politics of a nation shapes its approach to languages and bilingual education.
The contemporary politics of bilingual education relates to the education of immigrants (e.g., in the United States, the United Kingdom), the preservation of nationalism (e.g., the fate of Breton in France), the devolution of power to regions (e.g., Wales, Catalonia), language revitalization (e.g., Native American Indians, the Maori in New Zealand), internationalism (e.g., the European Schools Movement, bilingual education in Japan), and the emancipatory education of deaf people (e.g., through bilingual education in a sign language and a majority language – see Baker and Jones, 1998). The varying politics of immigrant assimilation and political integration, economic protectionism and global trade, institutionalized racism and equality of opportunity, and recent debates about peace and terrorism can make bilingual education as much about politics as about education. Bilingual education also has become associated with political debates about dominance and control by elites, questions about social order, and the perceived potential subversiveness of language minorities (Garcia, 2002; Tollefson, 2002).
In Macedonia (Tankersley, 2001), China (Zhou, 2001), the United States (Wiese and Garcia, 2001), and the South Pacific (Lotherington, 1998), bilingual education also can be positively located within attempts to effect social, cultural, economic, or political change, particularly in strengthening the weak, empowering the powerless, and invigorating those most susceptible. This is illustrated by Tankersley (2001). Contextualized within the recent ethnic conflict in the Balkans, she examines a Macedonian/ Albanian dual language program. The program demonstrated success in aiding community rebuilding after the war and the growth of cross-ethnic friendships. The research shows the potential for bilingual education program to develop students’ respect for different languages and cultures, and help to resolve ethnic conflict. However, because the Macedonian language was connected with greater power and prestige, obtaining an equal balance of languages in the classroom was complex.
The importance of a historical perspective on bilingual education as politics is provided by Wiese and Garcia (2001) through an analysis of the U.S. Bilingual Education Act from 1968 to the present. The changing U.S. ideologies in minority language civil liberties, equality of educational opportunity, assimilation, and multiculturalism become translated into legislation and tested in litigation. Most recently, the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 placed an

Bilingual Education 33

emphasis on accountability and testing. Whereas Title V authorizes programs for Native Indian, Native Hawaiian and Alaskan Native Education, Title III requires testing in English for most language minority students. All states are required to monitor the progress of some 3.68 million U.S. language minority students in meeting their English proficiency and academic objectives. The paradox is that the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001 followed the September 11 terrorist attacks. In the aftermath of the attacks, politicians, the press, and the public lamented the lack of language and cultural skills in U.S. intelligence and defense. It also seems possible that peace and harmony between religions and regions would be aided by producing bilinguals who appreciate the diversity that is possibly intrinsic in bilingualism and biculturalism.
Research and analysis of Proposition 227 in California has led to it being one of the most profiled examples of power and politics governing bilingual education (Stritikus, 2001; Crawford, 2004). In effect, Proposition 227 aimed at outlawing bilingual education in California. Proposition 227 was passed in a public ballot by a margin of 61% to 39%. Analysis of the voting and subsequent surveys found that Latinos were clearly against the proposition but, nevertheless, bilingual education became virtually illegal.
The importance of bilingual education for minority language literacy development and biliteracy has become a major recent theme (e.g., Martin-Jones and Jones, 2000; Hornberger, 2003). Using contexts of classroom, home, and community, such literacy research tends to be less concerned with teaching and learning methodology and more focused on, for example, the relationship between asymmetrical power relations and literacy practices that reproduce social inequalities and competing discourses about what counts as literacy. Current biliteracy research suggests that language policies and practices in education are struggles over power and authority, equity and marginalization, legitimacy and social order, symbolic domination and identities, social categorization, and social hierarchicization. Any consideration about who should speak what language, how, when, and where is essentially about what counts as legitimate language and who has dominance and control. Hence, those in power who legitimate the current social order regulate access to linguistic norms and linguistic resources to preserve their power and position.
However cogent and coherent are the philosophical and pedagogic and foundations for bilingualism, biliteracy, and biculturalism, however strong are the educational arguments for bilingual education,

and however strong are the arguments for the preservation of vanishing languages in the world, it is the politics of power, status, assimilation, and social order that can refute bilingual education so swiftly. However, bilingual education is typically a necessary, and sometimes an essential condition for the preservation of language species in the world. Where there is a shortfall in minority language reproduction in the family, then language production at school is essential in education to retain or increase the number and density of minority language speakers. From preschool bilingual education to adult language learning (e.g., in Ulpanim), bilingual education has a possible contemporary function not only to educate but also for minority language transmission.
Language Revitalization through Bilingual Education
Bilingual education is sometimes a component of national or regional language planning that varyingly attempts to assimilate indigenous and immigrant minorities, or integrate newcomers or minority groups (e.g., U.S., U.K.). On other occasions, bilingual education is a major plank in language revitalization and language reversal (e.g., among Native American Indians, the Sa´ mi in Scandinavia, and the Maori in New Zealand).
The growing interest in endangered and dying languages has recently provided a further raison d’eˆtre to bilingual education. The predicted demise of many or most of the world’s languages has created a momentum for language planning (Littlebear, 1999; Nettle and Romaine, 2000; Skutnabb-Kangas, 2000; Spolsky, 2004). For a minority language to survive, it has to produce new speakers, mostly via family language transmission and the education system (including adult language learning). Language planners tend to believe that bilingual education is an important means of language maintenance, language revitalization and reversing language shift, for example, among Native American Indians (Bia and McCarty, 2002; Francis and Reyhner, 2002; House, 2002), Ecuadorians (King, 2001), and the Basques (Gardner, 2000). Language acquisition planning via bilingual education becomes essential for language revival but insufficient by itself.
Nevertheless, bilingual education cannot gain its rational solely from language restoration or maintenance. It requires research to demonstrate underlying educational advantages (e.g., raising student achievement, increasing employment opportunities). There is sometimes over-optimism among language planners about what can be expected from and delivered by bilingual education in revitalizing a language.

34 Bilingual Education

Although bilingual education has an important role in language reproduction, and without bilingual education a minority language may not be able to survive except through intense religious usage, bilingual education cannot deliver language maintenance by itself.
The Advantages of ‘Strong’ Forms of Bilingual Education
Support for bilingual education tends to circle around eight interacting advantages of bilingual education that are claimed for students. There also are societal benefits that already have been alluded to in the above discussion of politics and bilingual education and will be briefly mentioned later. This section concentrates on the individual advantages.
First, bilingual education typically enables both languages to reach higher levels of competency. This potentially enables children to engage in wider communication across generations, regions, and cultural groups (Cummins, 2000). Second, bilingual education ideally develops a broader enculturation, a more sensitive view of different creeds and cultures. Bilingual education will usually deepen an engagement with the cultures associated with the languages, fostering a sympathetic understanding of differences, and, at its best, avoids the tight compartmentalization of racism and stereotyping. Third, strong forms of bilingual education frequently leads to biliteracy (see Hornberger, 2003). Accessing literacy practices in two or more languages adds more functions to a language (e.g., using in employment), widening the choice of literature for enjoyment, giving more opportunities for understanding different perspectives and viewpoints, and leading to a deeper understanding of history and heritage, of traditions and territory (Tse, 2001).
Fourth, research on dual language schools, Canadian immersion education, and heritage language education suggest that curriculum achievement is increased through content learning occurring via dual language curriculum strategies (Cummins, 2000; Tse, 2001). This is returned to later in this article. Fifth, plentiful research suggests that children with two well-developed languages share cognitive benefits (Bialystok, 2001). Such thinking advantages include being more creative because of their dual language systems (Baker, 2001), being more sensitive in communication as they may be interpersonally aware, for example, when needing to codeswitch, and tend to be more introspective of their languages (metalinguistic advantages – see Bialystok, 2001). Sixth, children’s self-esteem may be raised in bilingual education for minority language students (Cummins, 2000). The opposite is when a child’s home language is replaced by the majority language. Then, the child

itself, the parents and relatives, and not least the child’s community may appear as inadequate and disparaged by the school system. When the home language is used in school, then children may feel themselves, their home, family, and community to be accepted, thus maintaining or raising their self-esteem.
Seventh, bilingual education may aid the establishment of a more secure identity at a local, regional, and national level. Sharing Welsh, Maori, or Native American Indian identity may be enhanced by the heritage language and culture being celebrated and honored in the classroom. Developing a KoreanAmerican, Bengali-British, or Greek-Australian identity can be much aided by strong forms of bilingual education, and challenged or even negated by weak forms. Eighth, in some regions (e.g., Catalonia, Scandinavia) there are economic advantages for having experienced bilingual (or trilingual) education. Being bilingual can be important to secure employment in many public services and particularly when there is a customer interface requiring switching effortlessly between two or more languages. To secure a job as a teacher, to work in the mass media, to work in local government and increasingly in the civil service in countries such as Canada, Wales, and the Basque Country, bilingualism has become important. Thus, bilingual education is increasingly seen as delivering relatively more marketable employees than monolingual education (Dutcher, 1995; Tse, 2001).
To this list may be added the potential societal, ethnic group, or community benefits of bilingual education (May, 2001; Peyton et al., 2001; Stroud, 2001; Tse, 2001) such as continuity of heritage, cultural vitality, empowered and informed citizenship, raising school and state achievement standards, social and economic inclusion, social relationships and networking, ethnic group self-determination, and distinctiveness. This is well illustrated by Feuerverger (2001) in an ethnography of a village (Neve Shalom/ Wahat Al-Salam) in Israel, where Jews and Palestinians attempt to live together harmoniously and cooperatively, maintaining respect for the culture, identity, and languages of each group. This is partly attempted by two schools, an elementary school and the ‘School for Peace,’ which create bilingual Hebrew-Arabic bilinguals.
The Effectiveness of Bilingual Education
Research support for bilingual education is relatively robust (Baker, 2001) although there has been much political challenge to this in the United States (Crawford, 2004). Perhaps the strongest research support for bilingual education derives from

Bilingual Education 35

evaluations of immersion education, particularly from Canada since the 1960s (Johnstone, 2002). There is plentiful research from the United States since the 1960s (see Baker, 2001, for a review).
Evaluations of the effectiveness of dual language schools indicate relative success. One of the most wide-ranging evaluations of dual language schools is by Lindholm-Leary (2001). She analyzed teacher attributes, teacher talk, parental involvement and satisfaction, as well as student outcomes (using 4854 students) in different program types. These programs included Transitional Bilingual Education, English-Only, the 90:10 Dual Language Model, and the 50:50 Dual Language Model. The measured outcomes included Spanish and English language proficiency, academic achievement and attitudes of the students. Socioeconomic background and other student characteristics were taken into account in reporting results. Among a wealth of findings, Lindholm-Leary (2001) found that
. students who had 10% or 20% of their instruction in English scored as well on English proficiency as those in English-only programs and as well as those in 50:50 dual language (DL) programs;
. Spanish proficiency was higher in 90:10 than 50:50 (DL) programs. Students tended to develop higher levels of bilingual proficiency in the 90:10 than the 50:50 DL program;
. for Spanish-speaking students, no difference in English language proficiency was found between the 90:10 and 50:50 DL programs. However, DL students outperformed transitional bilingual education (TBE) students in English by the Grade 6;
. students in both the 90:10 and 50:50 DL programs were performing about 10 points higher in reading achievement than the Californian state average for English-speaking students educated in English-only programs;
. higher levels of bilingual proficiency were associated with higher levels of reading achievement;
. on Mathematics tests, DL students performed on average 10 points higher on Californian norms for English-speaking students educated only in English. There was a lack of difference in the scores of 90:10 and 50:50 DL students;
. DL students tended to reveal very positive attitudes toward their DL programs, teachers, classroom environment and the learning process.
Thomas and Collier’s (2002) Final Report on their 1985 to 2001 database of 210,054 minority language students’ academic achievement in eight different models of education indicates that: schooling in the home language has a much greater effect on achievement than socioeconomic status; late immigrants whose early education was in their

home language outperformed early immigrants schooled in English only; enrichment (heritage language) 90:10 programs and dual language programs (50:50) were the most academically successful for English L2 students and had the lowest dropout rates; the strongest predictor of L2 student achievement is the amount of formal L1 schooling with the more L1 schooling, the higher the L2 achievement; the highest quality ESL content programs reduce about half of the total achievement gap between those in enrichment or dual language programs and those without any bilingual support.
However, the reasons why research finds bilingual education linked with higher achievement are neither simple nor straightforward (August and Hakuta, 1997). There is likely to be a complex equation between such academic success and factors such as the support of the home (e.g., in encouraging literacy development), the devotion and dedication of teachers in school, children feeling their minority language is accepted and their self-esteem thus supported, and the positive relationship between bilingual education and cognitive development. Laosa (2000) reveals that school characteristics such as the quality and ratio of teachers per student, the teacher’s credentials, and fragmentation of instruction are potentially influential in student achievement. That is, particular models of bilingual education interact with a host of student, teacher, curriculum, and environmental variables in complex ways to influence student outcomes. It cannot be assumed that bilingual education, per se, results in higher attainment across the curriculum. There are many interacting variables that will underlie such success with no simple recipes for guaranteed success.
The English Language and Bilingual Education
The paradox of English in bilingual education is illustrated by the research of Valde´s (2001). English language learning policies enacted in schools can deny access to the language and knowledge that would empower U.S. immigrant children. Valde´s (2001) shows that, separately and cumulatively, there are complex interacting classroom factors that frequently work against a student’s second language development, achievement, employment, citizen rights and opportunities, and self-esteem. Such factors include a lack of regular, purposeful, and developing interactions with native speakers, impoverished second language interactions with teachers on a staff-student ratio of over 1:30, passive learning and ‘tight discipline’ strategies, mixed language competence classes working to a low common denominator, subject matter kept simplistic as the second language

is insufficiently developed, and teachers’ concerns with ‘flawed language’ forms rather than communication: ‘‘Placing blame is not simple. Structures of dominance in society interact with educational structures and educational ideologies as well as with teachers’ expectations and with students’ perspectives about options and opportunities’’ (Valde´s, 2001: 4).
The ‘English language dominance’ dangers for bilingual education also are found in access to Information Communications Technology (ICT) for language minority students. ICT is often dominated by the English language. This relates to current debates about the place of the English language in bilingual education in the context of the internationalization of English and its growing worldwide prominence as a second language rather than a mother tongue (Graddol and Meinhof, 1999). In contrast, there are potential opportunities to support the future of minority languages in education through ICT such as e-books, machine translation, voice recognition, WebTV, international e-mailing, and text messaging (Skourtou, 2002).
The Limitations of Bilingual Education
Although bilingual education has an increasing number of international supporters, it is not without some political critics, especially in the United States – see Cummins (2000) for a review. This has been considered earlier. There also are limitations to the pedagogical view of bilingual education. Bilingual education is no absolute guarantee of effective schooling. It is ingenuous to imagine that employing two or more languages in the school curriculum automatically leads to a raising of achievement, more effective schooling, or a more child-centered education. In reality, the languages of the school are but part of an extensive matrix of variables that interact in complex ways to make schooling more or less effective. Among bilingual schools in every country, there is often a mixture of the outstanding and the ordinary, those in an upward spiral of enhancing their quality, and those that depend on past glories rather than current successes. The school effectiveness research movement has located many of the important factors that make such schools more or less effective (August and Hakuta, 1997). Bilingual education is only one ingredient among many.
Another limitation of the pedagogical perspective on bilingual education is the nature and use of language learned at school. Canadian research suggests that the language register of formal (e.g., immersion) education does not necessarily prepare children for language use outside the school (Cummins, 2000). The language of the curriculum is increasingly complex and specialized. The vernacular of the peer group and the lingo of the

street is different. Canadian children from Englishspeaking homes who have been to immersion schools and learnt through the medium of French and English sometimes report difficulty in communicating appropriately with French speakers in local communities. Local French speakers can find such students’ French too formal, awkward, or even inappropriate.
A further concern about bilingual education is that language learning may stop at the school gates. The minority language may be effectively transmitted and competently learned in the classroom. Once outside the school gates, children may switch into the majority language for reasons of status, acceptance by peers, and inclusiveness in peer relations (that is, the majority language is often the ‘common denominator’ language). Thus, the danger of bilingual education in a minority language is that the language becomes a language of school but not of play; a language of the content delivery of the curriculum but not of peer culture. Extending a minority language learnt at school to use in the community over the teenage and adulthood years is something that is difficult to engineer, difficult to plan, but nevertheless vital if that language is to live outside the school gates.

What Is Bilingualism?
Bilingualism is a product of extensive language contact (i.e., contacts between people who speak different languages). There are many reasons for speakers of different languages to get into contact with one another. Some do so out of their own choosing, whereas others are forced by circumstances. Among the frequently cited factors that contribute to language contact are education, modern technology, economy, religion and culture, political or military acts, and natural disasters. One does not have to move to a different place to be in contact with people speaking a different language. There are plenty of opportunities for language contact in the same country, the same community, the same neighborhood, or even the same family.
However, although language contact is a necessary condition for bilingualism at the societal level, it does not automatically lead to bilingualism at the individual level. For example, Belgium, Canada, Finland, India, Luxembourg, Paraguay, and Singapore, to name but a few countries, are bi- or multilingual, but the degree or extent of bilingualism among the residents of these countries varies significantly. There are large numbers of bilingual or multilingual individuals in Luxembourg, Paraguay, and Singapore, but considerably fewer in the other officially bi- or multilingual countries. Mackey (1962) claims that there are actually fewer bilingual people in bilingual countries than there are in the so-called ‘unilingual’ ones, because the main concerns of bi- or multilingual states are often the maintenance and use of two or more languages in the same nation, rather than the promotion of bilingualism among their citizens. It is therefore important to distinguish bilingualism as a social or societal phenomenon from bilingualism as an individual phenomenon.
Who Is Bilingual?
People who are brought up in a society in which monolingualism and uniculturalism are promoted as the normal way of life often think that bilingualism is only for a few, ‘special’ people. In fact, one in three of the world’s population routinely uses two or more languages for work, family life, and leisure. There are even more people who make irregular use of languages other than their native one; for example,

many people have learned foreign languages at school and only occasionally use them for specific purposes. If we count these people as bilinguals, then monolingual speakers would be a tiny minority in the world today.
Yet the question of who is and who is not a bilingual is more difficult to answer than it first appears. Baker and Prys Jones (1998: 2) suggest that in defining a bilingual person, we may wish to consider the following questions:
. Should bilingualism be measured by how fluent people are in two languages?
. Should bilinguals be only those people who have equal competence in both languages?
. Is language proficiency the only criterion for assessing bilingualism, or should the use of two languages also be considered?
. Most people would define a bilingual as a person who can speak two languages. What about a person who can understand a second language perfectly but cannot speak it? What about a person who can speak a language but is not literate in it? What about an individual who cannot speak or understand speech in a second language but can read and write it? Should these categories of people be considered bilingual?
. Should self-perception and self-categorization be considered in defining who is bilingual?
. Are there different degrees of bilingualism that can vary over time and with circumstances? For instance, a person may learn a minority language as a child at home and then later acquire another, majority language in the community or at school. Over time, the second language may become the stronger or dominant language. If that person moves away from the neighborhood or area in which the minority language is spoken or loses contact with those who speak it, he or she may lose fluency in the minority language. Should bilingualism therefore be a relative term?
The word ‘bilingual’ primarily describes someone with the possession of two languages. It can, however, also be taken to include the many people in the world who have varying degrees of proficiency in and interchangeably use three, four or even more languages. In many countries of Africa and Asia, several languages coexist and large sections of the population speak three or more languages. Individual multilingualism in these countries is a fact of life. Many people speak one or more local or ethnic languages, as well as another indigenous language which has become the medium of communication between different ethnic

Bilingualism 39

groups or speech communities. Such individuals may also speak a foreign language – such as English, French or Spanish – which has been introduced into the community during the process of colonization. This latter language is often the language of education, bureaucracy and privilege.
Multilingualism can also be the possession of individuals who do not live within a multilingual country or speech community. Families can be trilingual when the husband and wife each speak a different language as well as the common language of the place of residence. People with sufficient social and educational advantages can learn a second, third, or fourth language at school or university; at work; or in their leisure time. In many continental European countries, children learn two languages at school – such as English, German, or French – as well as being fluent in their home language – such as Danish, Dutch, or Luxembourgish.
It is important to recognize that a multilingual speaker uses different languages for different purposes and does not typically possess the same level or type of proficiency in each language. In Morocco, for instance, a native speaker of Berber may also be fluent in colloquial Moroccan Arabic but not literate in either of these languages. This Berber speaker will be educated in Modern Standard Arabic and use that language for writing and formal purposes. Classical Arabic is the language of the mosque, used for prayers and reading the Qur’an. Many Moroccans also have some knowledge of French, the former colonial language.
Theoretical Issues in Bilingualism Research
Chomsky (1986) defined three basic questions for modern linguistics:
i. What constitutes knowledge of language? ii. How is knowledge of language acquired? iii. How is knowledge of language put to use?
For bilingualism research, these questions can be rephrased to take in knowledge of more than one language (see also Cook, 1993):
i. What is the nature of language, or grammar, in the bilingual person’s mind, and how do two systems of language knowledge coexist and interact?
ii. How is more than one grammatical system acquired, either simultaneously or sequentially? In what aspects does bilingual language acquisition differ from unilingual language acquisition?

iii. How is the knowledge of two or more languages used by the same speaker in bilingual speech production?
Taking the acquisition question first, earlier observers of bilingual children concentrated on documenting the stages of their language development. Volterra and Taeschner (1978), for example, proposed a threestage model of early bilingual development. According to this model, the child initially possesses one lexical system composed of lexical items from both languages. In stage two, the child distinguishes two separate lexical codes but has one syntactic system at his or her disposal. Only when stage three is reached do the two linguistic codes become entirely separate. Volterra and Taeschner’s model gave rise to what is now known as the ‘unitary language system hypothesis.’ In its strongest version, the hypothesis supposes that the bilingual child has one single language system that they use for processing both of their languages in the repertoire.
In the 1980s, the unitary language system hypothesis came under intense scrutiny; for instance, by Meisel (1989) and Genesee (1989). They argue that there is no conclusive evidence to support the existence of an initial undifferentiated language system, and they also point out certain methodological inconsistencies in the three-stage model. The phenomenon of language mixing, for instance, can be interpreted as a sign of two developing systems existing side by side, rather than as evidence of one fused system. Meisel’s and Genesee’s studies led to an alternative hypothesis, known as the ‘separate development hypothesis’ or ‘independent development hypothesis.’ More recently, researchers have investigated the possibility that different aspects of language (e.g., phonology, vocabulary, syntax, pragmatics) of the bilingual child’s language systems may develop at different rates (e.g., Li and Zhu, 2001). Care needs to be taken in interpreting research evidence using children at different developmental stages.
Although the ‘one-versus-two-systems’ debate (i.e., whether bilingual children have an initially differentiated or undifferentiated linguistic system) continues to attract new empirical studies, a more interesting question has emerged regarding the nature of bilingual development. More specifically, is bilingual acquisition the same as monolingual acquisition? Theoretically, separate development is possible without there being any similarity with monolingual acquisition. Most researchers argue that bilingual children’s language development is, by and large, the same as that of monolingual children. In very general terms, both bilingual and monolingual children go through an initial babbling stage, followed by the

40 Bilingualism

one-word stage, the two-word stage, the multiword stage, and the multiclause stage. At the morphosyntactic level, a number of studies have reported similarities rather than differences between bilingual and monolingual acquisition. Garcia (1983), for example, compared the use of English morpheme categories by English monolingual children and bilingual children acquiring English and Spanish simultaneously and found no systematic difference at all. Pfaff and Savas (1988) found that their 4-year-old Turkish/ German subject made the same errors in Turkish case marking as reported in the literature on monolingual Turkish children. Muller’s (1990) study of two French/German children indicates that their use of subject–verb agreement and finite verb placement in both languages is virtually identical to that of comparable monolingual children. De Houwer (1990) found that her Dutch/English bilingual subject, Kate, used exactly the same word orders in Dutch as monolingual Dutch-speaking children, both in terms of types and in proportional use. Furthermore, De Houwer found in Kate parallels to monolingual children for both Dutch and English in a range of structures, such as nonfinite verb placement, preposed elements in affirmative sentences, clause types, sentence types, conjunctions, and question inversion.
Nevertheless, one needs to be careful in the kinds of conclusions one draws from such evidence. Similarities between bilingual and monolingual acquisition do not mean that the two languages a bilingual child is acquiring develop in the same way or at the same speed, or that the two languages a bilingual child is acquiring do not influence and interact with each other. Paradis and Genesee (1996), for example, found that although the 2–3-year-old French–English bilingual children they studied displayed patterns that characterize the performance of monolingual children acquiring these languages separately, and they acquired these patterns within the same age range as monolingual children, they used finite verb forms earlier in French than in English; used subject pronouns in French exclusively with finite verbs, but subject pronouns in English with both finite and nonfinite verbs, in accordance with the status of subject pronouns in French as clitics (or agreement markers) but full NPs in English; and placed verbal negatives after lexical verbs in French (e.g., ‘n’aime pas’) but before lexical verbs in English (‘do not like’). Further evidence of cross-linguistic influence has been reported by Dopke (1992), for example, in her study of German–English bilingual children in Australia. These children tended to overgeneralize the VO word order of English to German, which instantiates both VO and OV word orders, depending on the clausal structure of the utterance. Dopke suggests

that children learning English and German simultaneously are prone to overgeneralize SVO word order in their German because the VO order is reinforced on the surface of both the German and the English input they hear.
Most of the studies that have examined crosslinguistic influences in bilingual acquisition focus on morphosyntactic features. One area that has hitherto been underexplored is the interface between phonetics and phonology in bilingual acquisition. Although most people seem to believe that the onset of speech in the case of bilingual children is more or less the same as for monolingual children, there are indications that bilingual children seem to develop differently from monolingual children in the following three aspects: the overall rate of occurrence of developmental speech errors, the types of speech errors and the quality of sounds (Zhu and Dodd, 2005). For example, studies on Cantonese/English (Holm and Dodd), Putonghua/Cantonese (So and Leung), Welsh/English (Ball et al.), Spanish/English (Yavas and Goldstein), and Punjabi/English (Stow and Pert) (also in Zhu and Dodd, 2006) bilingual children seem to indicate that bilingual children tend to make not only more speech errors but also different types of speech errors compared with monolingual children of the same age. These speech errors would be considered atypical if they had occurred in the speech of monolingual children. Moreover, although bilingual children seem to be able to acquire monolingual-like competence at the phonemic level, there are qualitative differences at the phonetic level in terms of production. For example, using instrumental analysis, Khattab (also in Zhu and Dodd, 2006) finds that although Arabic–English bilingual children have similar patterns of production and use of VOT, /l/, and /r/ in some respects to those of monolinguals from each language, they also show differences that are intricately related to age, input, and language context. These studies and others are reported in Zhu and Dodd (2005).
There is one area in which bilingual children clearly differ from monolingual children; namely, code-mixing. Studies show that bilingual children mix elements from both languages in the same utterance as soon as they can produce two-word utterances. Researchers generally agree that bilingual children’s mixing is highly structured and grammatically constrained, although there is no consensus on the nature of the specific constraints that organize their mixing. Vihman (1985), who studied her own son Raivo, who acquired English and Estonian simultaneously, argued, for example, that the language mixing by bilingual children is qualitatively different from that of more mature bilinguals. She invoked as evidence for this claim the fact that young bilingual children

Bilingualism 41

indicate a propensity to mix function words over contentives (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives) – a type of mixing that is rare in older bilingual mixing. However, Lanza’s (1997) study, although finding similar patterns in the mixing produced by her two Norwegian–English bilingual subjects, argued that children’s mixing is qualitatively the same as that of adults; their relatively greater degree of mixing of function words is evidence of what Lanza called ‘dominance’ of one language over another rather than of a substantial difference from bilingual adults’ mixing. Both Vihman’s and Lanza’s, as well as other studies of children’s mixing, show that bilingual children mix their languages in accordance with constraints that operate on adult mixing. The operation of constraints based on surface features of grammar, such as word order, is evident from the two-word/twomorpheme stage onward, and the operation of constraints based on abstract notions of grammatical knowledge is most evident in bilingual children once they demonstrate such knowledge overtly (e.g., verb tense and agreement markings), usually around two years and 6 months of age and older. As Genesee (2002) points out, these findings indicate that in addition to the linguistic competence needed to formulate correct monolingual strings, bilingual children have the added capacity to coordinate their two languages in accordance with the grammatical constraints of both languages during mixing. Although these studies provide further evidence for the separate development, or two-systems, argument, they also indicate that there are both quantitative and qualitative differences between bilingual acquisition and monolingual acquisition.
Another area of interest in acquisitional studies of bilingual children is the role of input and social context in the rate and order of language acquisition. Earlier assumptions were that the bilingual child would have half, or less, of the normal input in each of their two languages, compared with the monolingual child. More careful examinations of bilingual children show considerable variations in the quantity and quality of input, interactional styles of the parents, and environmental policies and attitudes toward bilingualism. On the basis of Harding and Riley’s work (1986), Romaine (1995) distinguished six types of early-childhood bilingualism according to the native language of the parents, the language of the community at large, and the parents’ strategy in speaking to the child.
Type 1: One person, one language.
. Parents: The parents have different native languages, with each having some degree of competence in the other’s language.

. Community: The language of one of the parents is the dominant language of the community.
. Strategy: The parents each speak their own language to the child from birth.
Type 2: Nondominant Home Language/One Language, One Environment
. Parents: The parents have different native languages.
. Community: The language of one of the parents is the dominant language of the community.
. Strategy: Both parents speak the nondominant language to the child, who is fully exposed to the dominant language only when outside the home, and in particular in nursery school.
Type 3: Nondominant Home Language without Community Support
. Parents: The parents share the same native languages.
. Community: The dominant language is not that of the parents.
. Strategy: The parents speak their own language to the child.
Type 4: Double Nondominant Home Language without Community Support
. Parents: The parents have different native languages.
. Community: The dominant language is different from either of the parents.
. Strategy: The parents each speak their own language to the child from birth.
Type 5: Nonnative Parents
. Parents: The parents share the same native language.
. Community: The dominant language is the same as that of the parents.
. Strategy: One of the parents always addresses the child in a language that is not his or her native language.
Type 6: Mixed Languages
. Parents: The parents are bilingual. . Community: Sectors of community may also be
bilingual. . Strategy: Parents code-switch and mix languages.
The three headings Romaine used to classify the six types of childhood bilingualism – the languages of the parents, the sociolinguistic situation of the community, and the discourse strategies of the parents and other immediate carers – are critical factors not only in the process of bilingual acquisition but also in

42 Bilingualism

the final product of that process (i.e., the type of bilingual speaker it produces). Arguably, the six types of bilingual children would grow up as different types of bilinguals with different mental representations of the languages and different patterns of language behavior.
Research on the cognitive organization and representation of bilingual knowledge is inspired and influenced by the work of Weinreich. Focussing on the relationship between the linguistic sign (or signifier) and the semantic content (signified), Weinreich (1953) distinguished three types of bilinguals. In type A, the individual combines a signifier from each language with a separate unit of the signified. Weinreich called them ‘coordinative’ (later often called ‘coordinate’) bilinguals. In type B, the individual identifies two signifiers but regards them as a single compound, or composite, unit of signified; hence ‘compound’ bilinguals. Type C refers to people who learn a new language with the help of a previously acquired one. They are called ‘subordinative’ (or ‘subordinate’) bilinguals. Weinreich’s examples were from English and Russian:
(A) ‘b?ook’ ‘kn?iga’
/buk/ /kn’iga/
(C) ‘book’ |
/buk/ |
/kn’iga/
Weinreich’s distinctions are often misinterpreted in the literature as referring to differences in the degree of proficiency in the languages, but in fact the relationship between language proficiency and cognitive organization of the bilingual individual, as conceptualized in Weinreich’s model, is far from clear. Some ‘subordinate’ bilinguals demonstrate a very high level of proficiency in processing both languages, as evidenced in grammaticality and fluency of speech, and some ‘coordinative’ bilinguals show difficulties in processing two languages simultaneously (i.e., in code-switching or in ‘foreign’ word identification tasks). It must also be stressed that Weinreich’s distinctions among bilingual individuals are distributed along a continuum from a subordinate or compound end to a coordinate end and can at the same time be more subordinate or compound for certain concepts

and more coordinate for others, depending on, among other things, the age and context of acquisition.
Weinreich’s work influenced much of the psycholinguistic modelling of the bilingual lexicon. Potter et al. (1984) presented a reformulation of the manner in which bilingual lexical knowledge could be represented in the mind in terms of two competing models: the Concept Mediation Model and the Word Association model. In the Concept Mediation Model, words of both L1 and L2 are linked to amodal conceptual representations. In the Lexical Association Model, in contrast, words in a second language are understood through L1 lexical representations. As can be seen in Figure 1, the models are structurally equivalent to Weinreich’s distinction between coordinative and subordinative bilingualism. At the same time, several researchers (e.g., Kolers and Gonzalez [1980] and Hummel [1986]) presented evidence for the so-called dual-store model, as represented in Figure 2. This latter model has also generated considerable research on the existence of the putative ‘bilingual language switch’ postulated to account for the bilingual’s ability to switch between languages on the basis of environmental demands (e.g., MacNamara, 1967; MacNamara and Kushnir, 1971).
Subsequent studies found conflicting evidence in favor of different models. Some of the conflicting evidence could be explained by the fact that different types of bilingual speakers were used in the experiments in terms of proficiency level, age, and context of acquisition. It is possible that lexical mediation is associated with low levels of proficiency, and concept mediation with higher levels, especially for those who have become bilingual in later childhood or adulthood. Some researchers called for a developmental dimension in the modelling of bilingual knowledge. Kroll and Stewart (1994), for example, proposed the Revised Hierarchical Model, which represents concept mediation and word association not as different models but as alternative routes within the same model (see Figure 3).
An important distinctive feature of being bilingual is being able to make appropriate language choices. Bilingual speakers choose to use their different

languages depending on a variety of factors, including the type of person addressed (e.g., members of the family, schoolmates, colleagues, superiors, friends, shopkeepers, officials, transport personnel, neighbors), the subject matter of the conversation (e.g., family concerns, schoolwork, politics, entertainment), location or social setting (e.g., at home, in the street, in church, in the office, having lunch, attending a lecture, negotiating business deals), and relationship with the addressee (e.g., kin, neighbors, colleagues, superior/inferior, strangers). However, even more complex are the many cases in which a bilingual talks to another bilingual with the same linguistic background and changes from one language to another in the course of conversation. This is what is known as code-switching. Figure 4 illustrates a decision-making process of the bilingual speaker in language choice and code-switching.
There is a widespread impression that bilingual speakers code-switch because they cannot express themselves adequately in one language. This may be true to some extent when a bilingual is momentarily lost for words in one of his or her languages. However, code-switching is an extremely common practice among bilinguals and takes many forms. A long narrative may be divided into different parts expressed in different languages, sentences may begin in one language and finish in another, and words and phrases from different languages may succeed each other. Linguists have devoted much attention to the study of code-switching. It has been demonstrated that code-switching involves skilled manipulation of overlapping sections of two or more grammars and

that there is virtually no instance of ungrammatical combination of two languages in code-switching, regardless of the bilingual ability of the speaker. Some suggest that code-switching is itself a discrete mode of speaking, emanating from a single codeswitching grammar.
One important aspect of the code-switching grammar is that the two languages involved do not play the same role in sentence making. Typically, one language sets the grammatical framework, with the other providing certain items to fit into the framework. Code-switching therefore is not a simple combination of two sets of grammatical rules but grammatical integration of one language in another. Bilingual speakers of different proficiency levels in their two languages or speaking two typologically different languages can engage in code-switching and, indeed, vary it according to their needs. The possible existence of a code-switching grammar calls into question the traditional view of the bilingual as two monolinguals in one person (for further discussions, see Grosjean, 1985). One consequence of the ‘twoin-one’ perspective is that bilingual speakers are often compared to monolinguals in terms of their language proficiency.
For example, some researchers have suggested that bilingual children have smaller vocabularies and lessdeveloped grammars than their monolingual peers, while their ability to exploit the similarities and differences in two sets of grammatical rules to accomplish rule-governed code-switching was not considered relevant. In some experimental psycholinguistic studies, tests are given without taking into account that bilingual speakers may have learned their two languages under different conditions for different purposes and that they only use them in different situations with different people. It is important to emphasize that bilingual speakers have a unique

linguistic and psychological profile; their two languages are constantly in different states of activation, and they are able to call on their linguistic knowledge and resources according to the context and adapt their behavior to the task at hand.
Bilingualism as a Sociopolitical Issue
Language choice is not a purely linguistic issue. In many countries of the world, much of the social identification of individuals, as well as of groups, is accomplished through language choice. By choosing one or another of the two or more languages in one’s linguistic repertoire, a speaker reveals and defines his or her social relationships with other people. At a societal level, whole groups of people, and in fact, entire nations, can be identified by the language or languages they use. Language, together with culture, religion, and history, is a major component of national identity.
Multilingual countries are often thought to have certain problems that monolingual states do not. On the practical level, difficulties in communication within a country can act as an impediment to commerce and industry. More seriously, however, multilingualism is a problem for government. The process of governing requires communication both within the governing institutions and between the government and the people. This means that a language, or languages, must be selected as the language for use in governing. However, the selection of the ‘official language’ is not always easy, as it is not simply a pragmatic issue. For example, on pragmatic grounds, the best immediate choice for the language of government in a newly independent colony might be the old colonial language, as the colonial governing institutions and records are already in place in that language, and those nationals with the most government experience already know it. The old colonial language will not, however, be a good choice on nationalist grounds. For a people that has just acquired its own geographical territory, the language of the state that had denied it territorial control would not be a desirable candidate for a national symbol. Ireland has adopted a strategy in which both the national language, Irish, and the language of the deposed power, English, are declared as official; the colonial language is used for immediate, practical purposes, and the national language is promoted and developed. However, in many other multilingual countries that do not have a colonial past, such as China, deciding which language should be selected as the national language can sometimes lead to internal, ethnic conflicts.
Similarly, selecting a language for education in a multilingual country is often problematic. In some

respects, the best strategy for language in education is to use the various ethnic languages. After all, these are the languages the children already speak, and school instruction can begin immediately without waiting until the children learn the official language. Some would argue, however, that this strategy could be damaging for nation-building efforts and disadvantage children by limiting their access to the wider world. It should be pointed out that there is no scientific evidence to show that multilingual countries are particularly disadvantaged, in socioeconomic terms, compared to monolingual ones. In fact, all the research that was carried out in the 1960s and 1970s on the relationship between the linguistic diversity and economic well-being of a nation came to the conclusion that a country can have any degree of language uniformity or fragmentation and still be underdeveloped, and a country whose entire population speaks the same language can be anywhere from very rich to very poor. It might be true, however, that linguistic uniformity and economic development reinforce each other; in other words, economic wellbeing promotes the reduction of linguistic diversity. It would be lopsided logic, though, to view multilingualism as the cause of the socioeconomic problems of a nation.
Multilingualism is an important resource at both the societal and personal levels. For a linguistically diverse country to maintain ethnic group languages alongside the national or official languages can prove an effective way to motivate individuals while unifying the nation. In addition, a multiethnic society is arguably a richer, more exciting, and more stimulating place to live in than a community with only one dominant ethnic group. For the multilingual speaker, the availability of various languages in the community repertoire serves as a useful interactional resource. Typically, multilingual societies tend to assign different roles to different languages; one language may be used in informal contexts with family and friends, while another for the more formal situations of work, education, and government. Imagine two friends who are both bilingual in the same ‘home’ and ‘official’ languages. Suppose that one of them also works for the local government and that her friend has some official business with her. Suppose further that the government employee has two pieces of advice to give to her friend: one based on her official status as a government representative, and one based on their mutual friendship. If the official advice is given in the ‘government’ language and the friendly advice in the ‘home’ language, there is little chance that there would be any misunderstanding about which advice was which. The friend would not take the advice given in the ‘home’ language as official.

Bilingualism 45

There is a frequent debate in countries in which various languages coexist concerning which languages are a resource. The favored languages tend to be those that are both international and particularly valuable in international trade. A lower place is given in the status ranking to minority languages, which are small, regional, and of less perceived value in the international marketplace. For example, French has traditionally been the number one modern language in the British school curriculum, followed by German and Spanish, and then a choice between Italian, Modern Greek, and Portuguese. One may notice that all of these are European languages. Despite large numbers of mother-tongue Bengali, Cantonese, Gujarati, Hakka, Hindi, Punjabi, Turkish, and Urdu speakers in England, these languages occupy a very low position in the school curriculum. In the British National Curriculum, the languages Arabic, Bengali, Chinese (Cantonese or Mandarin), Gujarati, Modern Hebrew, Hindi, Japanese, Punjabi, Russian, Turkish, and Urdu are initially only allowed in secondary schools (for 11–18 year olds) if a major European language such as French is taught first (Milroy and Milroy, 1985).
Clearly, multilingualism as a national and personal resource requires careful planning, as would any other kind of resource. However, language planning has something that other kinds of economic planning do not usually have: language as its own unique cultural symbolic value. As has been discussed earlier, language is a major component of the identity of a nation and an individual. Often, strong emotions are evoked when talking about a certain language. Language planning is not simply a matter of standardizing or modernizing a corpus of linguistic materials, nor is it a reassignment of functions and status. It is also about power and influence. The dominance of some languages and the dominated status of other languages are partly understandable if we examine who hold positions of power and influence, who belong to elite groups that are in control of decisionmaking, and who are in subordinate groups, on whom decisions are implemented. It is more often than not the case that a given arrangement of languages benefits only those who have influence and privileges.
For the multilingual speaker, language choice is not only an effective means of communication but also an act of identity (Le Page and Tabouret-Keller, 1985). Every time we say something in one language when we might just as easily have said it in another, we are reconnecting with people, situations, and power configurations from our history of past interactions and imprinting on that history our attitudes toward

the people and languages concerned. Through language choice, we maintain and change ethnic group boundaries and personal relationships and construct and define ‘self’ and ‘other’ within a broader political economy and historical context.
Changes in Attitudes Toward Bilingualism
From the early nineteenth century to about the 1960s, there was a widespread belief that bilingualism has a detrimental effect on a human beings’ intellectual and spiritual growth. Stories of children who persisted in speaking two languages in school having had their mouths washed with soap and water or being beaten with a cane were not uncommon. The following is a quote from a professor at Cambridge University that illustrates the dominant belief of the time, even among academics and intellectuals:
If it were possible for a child to live in two languages at once equally well, so much the worse. His intellectual and spiritual growth would not thereby be doubled, but halved. Unity of mind and character would have great difficulty in asserting itself in such circumstances. (Laurie, 1890: 15)
Professor Laurie’s view represented a commonly held belief throughout the twentieth century that bilingualism disadvantages rather than advantages one’s intellectual development. Early research on bilingualism and cognition tended to confirm this negative viewpoint, finding that monolinguals were superior to bilinguals on intelligence tests. One of the most widely cited studies was done by Saer (1923) who studied 1400 Welsh–English bilingual children between the ages of 7 and 14 years in five rural and two urban areas of Wales. A 10-point difference in IQ was found between the bilinguals and the monolingual English speakers from rural backgrounds. From this, Saer concluded that bilinguals were mentally confused and at a disadvantage in intelligence compared with monolinguals. It was further suggested, with a follow-up study of university students, that ‘‘the difference in mental ability as revealed by intelligence tests is of a permanent nature since it persists in students throughout their university career’’ (Saer, 1923: 53).
Controversies regarding the early versions of IQ tests and the definition and measurement of intelligence aside, there were a number of problems with Saer’s study and its conclusions. First, it appeared to be only in the rural areas that the correlation between bilingualism and lower IQ held. In urban areas, monolinguals and bilinguals were

46 Bilingualism

virtually the same; in fact, the average IQ for urban Welsh–English bilingual children in Saer’s study was 100, whereas for monolingual, Englishspeaking children it was 99. The urban bilingual children had more contact with English both before beginning school and outside school hours than did the rural bilinguals. Thus, the depressed scores of the rural population were probably more a reflection of lack of opportunity and contexts to use English and were not necessarily indicative of any sociopsychological problems.
More important, however, is the issue of statistical inference in this and other studies of a similar type. Correlations do not allow us to infer cause-and-effect relationships, particularly when other variables – such as rural versus urban differences – may be mediating factors. Another major factor is the language in which such tests were administered, particularly tests of verbal intelligence. Many such studies measured bilinguals only in the second or nondominant language.
At around the same time that Saer conducted studies on bilinguals’ intelligence, some well-known linguists expressed their doubts about bilingual speakers’ linguistic competence. The following is Bloomfield’s characterization of a Menomini Indian man in the United States, whom he believed to have ‘deficient’ knowledge of Menomini and English:
White Thunder, a man around 40, speaks less English than Menomini, and that is a strong indictment, for his Menomini is atrocious. His vocabulary is small, his inflections are often barbarous, he constructs sentences of a few threadbare models. He may be said to speak no language tolerably. (Bloomfield, 1927: 395)
This is one of the early statements of a view that became fashionable in educational circles; namely, that it was possible for bilinguals not to acquire full competence in any of the languages they spoke. Such an individual was said to be ‘semilingual.’ These people were believed to have linguistic deficits in six areas of language (see Hansegard, 1975; Skutnabb-Kangas, 1981):
1. Size of vocabulary 2. Correctness of language 3. Unconscious processing of language 4. Language creation 5. Mastery of the functions of language 6. Meanings and imagery.
It is significant that the term ‘semilingualism’ emerged in connection with the study of language skills of people belonging to ethnic minority groups. Research that provided evidence in support of the notion of ‘semilingualism’ was conducted in

Scandinavia and North America and was concerned with accounting for the educational outcomes of submersion programs in which minority children were taught through the medium of the majority language. However, these studies, similar to the ones conducted by Saer, had serious methodological flaws, and the conclusions reached by the researchers were misguided.
First, the educational tests used to measure language proficiencies and to differentiate between people were insensitive to the qualitative aspects of languages and to the great range of language competences. Language may be specific to a context; a person may be competent in some contexts but not in others. Second, bilingual children are still in the process of developing their languages. It is unfair to compare them to some idealized adults. Their language skills change over time. Third, the comparison with monolinguals is also unfair. It is important to distinguish whether bilinguals are ‘naturally’ qualitatively and quantitatively different from monolinguals in their use of the two languages (i.e., as a function of being bilingual). Fourth, if languages are relatively underdeveloped, the origins may not be in bilingualism per se but in the economic, political, and social conditions that evoke underdevelopment.
The disparaging and belittling overtone of the term ‘semilingualism’ itself invokes expectations of underachievement in the bilingual speaker. Thus, rather than highlighting the apparent ‘deficits’ of bilingual speakers, the more positive approach is to emphasize that when suitable conditions are provided, languages are easily capable of development beyond the ‘semi’ state.
One of the specific issues Bloomfield raised in his comments on the language behavior of members of the Menomini Indians in North America was the frequent mixing of their own language and English. It has been described as ‘verbal salad,’ not particularly appealing but nevertheless harmless, or ‘garbage’ that is definitively worthless and vulgar. Unfortunately, although switching and mixing of languages occurs in practically all bilingual communities and all bilingual speakers’ speech, it is stigmatized as an illegitimate mode of communication, even sometimes by the bilingual speakers themselves. Haugen (1977: 97), for example, reports that a visitor from Norway made the following comment on the speech of the Norwegians in the United States: ‘‘Strictly speaking, it is no language whatever, but a gruesome mixture of Norwegian and English, and often one does not know whether to take it humorously or seriously.’’ Gumperz (1982: 62–63) reports that some bilingual speakers who mixed languages regularly still believe such behavior was ‘‘bad manners’’ or a sign of ‘‘lack

of education or improper control of language.’’ One of the Punjabi–English bilinguals Romaine interviewed said: ‘‘I’m guilty as well in the sense that we speak English more and more and then what happens is that when you speak your own language you get two or three English words in each sentence . . . but I think that’s ‘wrong’’’ (Romaine, 1995: 294).
Attitudes do not, of course, remain constant over time. At a personal level, changes in attitudes may occur when there is some personal reward involved. Speakers of minority languages will be more motivated to maintain and use their languages if they prove to be useful in increasing their employability or social mobility. In some cases, certain jobs are reserved for bilingual speakers only. At the societal level, attitudes toward bilingualism change when the political ideology changes. In California and elsewhere in the southwestern United States, for instance, pocho and calo used to serve as pejorative terms for the Spanish of local Chicanos. With a rise in ethnic consciousness, however, these speech styles have become symbolic of Chicano ethnicity and are now increasingly used in contemporary Chicano literature. Since the 1960s, there has been a political movement, particularly in the United States, advocating language rights. In the United States, questions about language rights are widely discussed not only in college classrooms and language communities but also in government and federal legislatures.
Language rights have a history of being tested in U.S. courtrooms. From the early 1920s to the present, there has been a continuous debate in U.S. courts of law regarding the legal status of language minority rights. To gain short-term protection and a mediumterm guarantee for minority languages, legal challenges have become an important part of the language rights movement. The legal battles concerned not just minority language vs. majority language contests, but also children vs. schools, parents vs. school boards, state vs. the federal authorities, and so on. Whereas minority language activists among the Basques in Spain and the Welsh in Britain have been taken to court by the central government for their actions, U.S. minority language activists have taken the central and regional government to court.
The language rights movement has received some support from organizations such as the United Nations, Unesco, the Council of Europe, and the European Union. Each of these four organizations has declared that minority language groups have the right to maintain their languages. In the European Union, a directive (77/486/E EC) stated that member states should promote the teaching of the mother tongue and the culture of the country of origin in the education of migrant workers’ children. The kind of

rights, apart from language rights, that minority groups may claim include protection, membership of their ethnic group and separate existence, nondiscrimination and equal treatment, education and information in their ethnic language, freedom to worship, freedom of belief freedom of movement, employment, peaceful assembly and association, political representation and involvement, and administrative autonomy.
However, real changes in attitudes toward bilingualism will not happen until people recognize or, better still, experience the advantages of being bilingual. Current research indicates that there are at least eight overlapping and interacting benefits for a bilingual person, encompassing communicative, cognitive and cultural advantages (adapted from Baker and Prys Jones, 1998: 6–8):
Communicative advantages Relationships with parents: Where parents have differing first languages, the advantage of children becoming bilingual is that they will be able to communicate in each parent’s preferred language. This may enable a subtler, finer texture of relationship with the parent. Alternatively they will be able to communicate with parents in one language and with their friends and within the community in a different language. Extended family relationships: Being a bilingual allows someone to bridge the generations. When grandparents, uncles, aunts and other relatives in another region speak a language that is different from the local language, the monolingual may be unable to communicate with them. The bilingual has the chance to bridge that generation gap, build closer relationships with relatives extended family. Community relationships: A bilingual has the chance to communicate with a wider variety of people than a monolingual. Bilingual children will be able to communicate in the wider community and with school and neighbourhood friends in different languages when necessary. Transnational communication: One barrier between nations and ethnic groups tends to be language. Language is sometimes a barrier to communication and to creating friendly relationships of mutual respect. Bilinguals in the home, in the community and in society have the potential for lowering such barriers. Bilinguals can act as bridges within the nuclear and extended family, within the community and across societies. Language sensitivity: Being able to move between two languages may lead to more sensitivity in Communication. Because bilinguals are constantly monitoring which language to use in different situations, they may be more attuned to the communicative needs of those with whom they talk. Research suggests that bilinguals may be more empathic towards listeners’ needs in communication. When meeting those who do not speak their language particularly well, bilinguals may be more patient listeners than monolinguals.

48 Bilingualism

Cultural advantages Another advantage of being a bilingual is having two or more worlds of experience. Bilingualism provides the opportunity to experience two or more cultures. The monolingual may experience a variety of cultures; for example, from different neighbours and communities that use the same language but have different ways of life. The monolingual can also travel to neighbouring countries and experience other cultures as a passive onlooker. However, to penetrate different cultures requires the language of that culture. To participate and become involved in the core of a culture requires a knowledge of the language of that culture. There are also potential economic advantages to being bilingual. A person with two languages may have a wider portfolio of jobs available. As economic trade barriers fall, as international relationships become closer, as unions and partnerships across nations become more widespread, all increasing number of jobs are likely to require a person to be bilingual or multilingual. jobs in multinational companies, jobs selling and exporting, and employment prospects generated by translational contact make the future of employment more versatile for bilinguals than monolinguals.
Cognitive advantages More recent research has shown that bilinguals may have some advantages in thinking, ranging from creative thinking to faster, progress in early cognitive development and greater sensitivity in communication. For example, bilinguals may have two or more words for some cactus object and idea; sometimes corresponding words in different languages have different connotations. Bilinguals are able to extend the range of meanings, associations and images, and to think more flexibly and creatively. Therefore, a bilingual has the possibility of more awareness of language and more fluency, flexibility and elaboration in thinking than a monolingual.
It would be misleading to suggest that there is no disadvantage to bilingualism. Some problems, both social and individual, may be falsely attributed to bilingualism. For instance, when bilingual children exhibit language or personality problems, bilingualism is sometimes blamed. Problems of social unrest may unfairly be attributed to the presence of two or more languages in a community. However, the real possible disadvantages of bilingualism tend to be temporary. For example, bilingual families may be spending significantly more of their time and making much greater efforts to maintain two languages and bring up children bilingually. Some bilingual children may find it difficult to cope with the school curriculum in either language for a short period of time. However, the individual, cognitive, cultural, intellectual, and economic advantages bilingualism brings to a person make all the effort worthwhile.
A more complex problem associated with bilingualism is the question of identity of a bilingual. If a

child has both a French and an English parent and speaks each language fluently, is he or she French, English, or Anglo-French? If a child speaks English and a minority language such as Welsh, is he or she Welsh, English, British, European, or what? It has to be said that for many bilingual people, identity is not a problem. Although speaking two languages, they are resolutely identified with one ethnic or cultural group. For example, many bilinguals in Wales see themselves as Welsh first, and possibly British next, but not English. Others, however, find identity a real, problematic issue. Some immigrants, for instance, desperately want to lose the identity of their native country and become assimilated and identified with the new home country, while some others want to develop a new identity and feel more comfortable with being culturally hyphenated, such as ChineseAmerican, Italian-Australian, Swedish/Finnish, or Anglo-French. Yet identity crises and conflicts are never static. Identities change and evolve over time, with varying experiences, interactions, and collaborations within and outside a language group.
Bilingualism is not a static and unitary phenomenon; it is shaped in different ways, and it changes depending on a variety of historical, cultural, political, economic, environmental, linguistic, psychological, and other factors. Our understanding of bilingual speakers’ knowledge and skills will grow as research methodology is defined and refined and our attitudes toward bilingualism change to the positive.

Bilingualism and Second Language Learning

T K Bhatia, Syracuse University, Syracuse, NY, USA ß 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
Introduction There is a widespread perception in monolingual societies, particularly in the United States, that bilingualism is a rare and exceptional occurrence in communication. By contrast, from a global perspective,

bilingualism is a world-wide phenomenon. In fact, global communication is often carried out through a speaker’s second, third, or even fourth language. According to David Crystal (1997) approximately two-thirds of the world’s children grow up in a bilingual environment which, in turn, leads to adult bilingualism/multilingualism. However, childhood bilingualism is not the only reason for adult bilingualism. A host of different factors (such as marriage, religion, education, linguistic plurality of a particular

50 Bilingualism and Second Language Learning

region, migration, jobs, government policies, urbanization, etc.) also lead to adult bilingualism. How, then, do humans become bilingual? Is adult secondlanguage learning different from child-language learning? Is bilingual-language acquisition different from monolingual-language acquisition? Is early bilingualism different from late bilingualism? Does second language learning have adverse cognitive effects on children? And how are two (or more) languages represented in the brain? This article attempts to answer these and other questions concerning bilingual language learning and use.
Key Concepts
Before discussing language development among bilinguals, it is crucial to give an overview of key fundamental concepts concerning language development in children and adults. Also, it should be mentioned that the term ‘second language learning’ is used in a wider sense to include the learning of any additional language during a period ranging from childhood to adulthood. An additional language may be a language of the country or spoken outside the country (i.e. foreign language).
Acquisition vs. Learning
A child’s process of learning languages is different from an adult’s process. A child can learn any language relatively effortlessly, while the same task becomes rather challenging for adults. For this reason, some second language researchers (Krashen, 1985) distinguish between two types of mechanisms in language development: a subconscious process resulting in tacit knowledge of the language (i.e., ‘language acquisition’), and a more conscious process (i.e., ‘language learning’). While children go through the former process, adults undergo the latter in their quest to become bilingual.
The Critical Period Hypothesis and Its Biological Basis
In addition to degree of effort, it has been frequently observed that even very proficient bilinguals fall short of being perfect bilinguals. In spite of the complete mastery of syntax, their speech is marked by traces of the first language accent. Similarly, it is also shown that in spite of considerable effort and motivation, the ultimate attainment of some grammatical structures by adults is seldom achieved. To explain these and other differences in language acquisition and recovery from aphasia Lenneberg (1967) proposed the ‘‘critical period hypothesis,’’ which is sensitive to age. This hypothesis claims that there is a period in the

maturation of human organism, lasting from two years to puberty, in which nearly effortless and complete language acquisition is possible. Afterwards, this hypothesis notes, language learning requires more effort and motivation, largely because of a loss of brain plasticity resulting in the completion of the lateralization of the language function in the left hemisphere. Recent research claims have additionally shown that there are different critical periods for different grammatical structures of language. Since the accent (phonetics and phonology) of a second language is the most difficult to attain, the critical period for phonetics and phonology (approximately from five to seven years) is earlier than that for morphology and syntax. See Johnson and Newport (1991) and Bhatia and Ritchie (1999) for details.
Access to Universal Grammar (UG)
Children are born to acquire human languages. Regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, or nationality, every normal child is capable at birth of acquiring any human language. In theoretical studies following from the Chomskyan mentalistic framework, this innate ability is termed the access to universal grammar (UG). In this case, a child has full access to universal grammar, whereas an adult has either limited or no access. These and other universal principles of grammatical structures and principles of learning largely lead a child’s language development. The role of parental input then becomes to trigger an appropriate value for innately given or set parameters, specific to the language to which the child is exposed. One such parameter, called the ‘head parameter,’ describes how a child does not have to even learn the specific word order of his/her language, but only has to choose between already specified values – head-initial or headfinal – based on the nature of the input language. Children begin to learn to set parametric values even from the one-word stage. A Japanese child learns to choose the head-final system, whereas an Englishspeaking child chooses the head-initial value. These principles are generally refereed to as a child’s language acquisition device (LAD).
Input and Learning Environment: Natural vs. Unnatural Settings
Usually children become bilingual or multilingual in a natural way. A normal child can become a fluent bilingual by the age of five, for instance, without any formal training. In the process of acquiring a language, the role of input (motherese, etc.) or imitation is important but limited. Children do not learn a language by mindlessly imitating the input provided by mothers or caretakers. That is, while the role

Bilingualism and Second Language Learning 51

of parental input cannot be ruled out, language acquisition studies show that neither motherese nor imitation plays a significant role in a child’s language development. Instead, this burden is carried by the child himself/herself. Research on child-language acquisition reveals that the child learns the language by using the ‘rule formulation strategy.’ For instance, an English-speaking child learns on his/her own that by the addition of the inflection ‘-ed’ to a verbal stem, one generates the corresponding past tense form of the verb. In this process, the child over-generalizes and produces utterances such as ‘I go-ed’ [go-PAST]. Even after being corrected [i.e. provided negative evidence] by the mother or caretaker that the child meant ‘I went’ [go.PAST], the child still does not reject the rule s/he has formulated in his or her mind and which s/he still produces in utterances such as ‘I went-ed’ [go.PAST-PAST]. The role of the adult is thus to prevent the child’s grammar from overgeneralization. In other words, the child has an innate capacity to acquire languages in an environment which is termed a ‘natural’ environment, whereas, by contrast, adults and school-age children learn language in formal settings such as schools and colleges through a formal instructional method.
Defining and Measuring Bilingualism
What is bilingualism and who is bilingual? Defining and measuring bilingualism is a very complex task due to the number and types of input conditions, biological, socio-psychological, and other nonlinguistic factors that can lead to a varying degree of bilingual competencies. In short, there is no widely-accepted definition or measures of bilinguals.
Instead, a rich range of scales, dichotomies, and categories are employed to characterize bilinguals. If a bilingual can understand but cannot speak a second language, such an individual is called a receptive bilingual, whereas a productive bilingual demonstrates a spoken proficiency in two languages. If the second language is acquired in a natural setting before the age of five that individual is termed an early bilingual, in contrast with a late bilingual who learns his second language after the age of five either in home or in schools. Labels such as fluent vs. non-fluent, functional vs. non-functional, balanced vs. unbalanced, primary vs. secondary, and partial vs. complete refer, either to a varying command in different types of language proficiency (e.g., spoken, listening, writing, etc.), or an asymmetrical relationship (dominance) between two languages. A compound vs. coordinate bilingual refers to the way two languages are processed in the brain. The list is by no means exhaustive. Other major distinctions such

as simultaneous vs. sequential are discussed in the next section. Similarly, bilingualism can be viewed from individual, societal (attitudes towards bilingualism), and political (i.e., government policies toward bilingualism) perspectives.
In general, a bilingual person demonstrates many complex attributes rarely seen in a monolingual person. For that reason, a bilingual is not equivalent to two monolinguals, but something entirely different. This working definition of bilingualism is offered by Bloomfield (1933), who claimed that a bilingual is one who has a native-like control of two languages, i.e., a balanced bilingual (see Grosjean 1982 or Edwards, 2004 for more details).
Patterns and Mechanisms in Bilinglual Language Development
Providing either a natural environment or inputs in monolingual/dominant language speech communities is not a challenging task. The same is also true for those societies where social and political systems are conducive to bilingualism. For instance, in India, where bilingualism is viewed as natural, approved by society, and further nurtured by government language policies, linguistic groups and communities do not need to take any special measures to assure that their children receive input from two languages. In sharp contrast, in societies where bilingualism is not valued or where the language of a minority is distinct, it becomes imperative for families to plan meaningful strategies to ensure the smooth exposure to the family language. One such strategy that families employ in this second setting, described by Bhatia and Ritchie (1999) as ‘‘discourse allocation,’’ restricts the use of one language to one social agent or social setting and the other language to other social situations. The various manifestations of such strategies are the following: (a) one-parent/one-language (e.g., the child’s mother speaks one language and, the child’s father speaks the other. This strategy was employed by Leopold (1939–1949) in his classic study of bilingual language development of his daughter, Hildegard; (b) one-place/one-language (e.g. speaking one language in the kitchen and the other elsewhere); (c) a language/time approach; and (d) a topic-related approach. Although the discourse allocation approach is better than providing no input and thus raising a monolingual child, it leads to different patterns in bilingual language development than developing bilingualism in a natural setting. For instance, during the early stages of Hildegard’s bilingualism, she developed a rule that fathers speak German and mothers speak in English.

52 Bilingualism and Second Language Learning

Childhood Bilingualism
Other factors such as age and amount of exposure to the two languages also result in differences in the pattern of childhood bilingualism. The distinction between simultaneous and sequential bilinguals in research on bilingual language acquisition is based on age and the degree of exposure to two languages. When the child is exposed to two languages to more or less the same degree from birth onward, the pattern of language development is referred to as simultaneous, whereas sequential bilingualism describes the attainment of one language first and the second language later, preferably before the age of seven. Similarly, the term late bilingual is used for those sequential bilinguals who acquire their second language at a relatively younger age than adults learning a second language. Although there is unanimous agreement among researchers about the validity of the simultaneous and sequential bilinguals, there is no consensus among scholars about the exact line of demarcation between the two. See McLaughlin (1984) and De Houwer (1995) for either theoretical or methodological grounds.
One of the most intriguing aspects of the childhood bilingualism is how children learn to separate the two languages, particularly in a natural setting (i.e., a simultaneous bilingual) in initial stages. After all, when parents provide input, they do not tag or prime their input with a language identification label. Even if parents go to the absurd length of identifying the language of each word or sentence they use, these labels are semantically empty for children. Furthermore, bilingual parents unwittingly make the task of separating the two languages even harder for children because of their normal tendency to mix two languages. In short, a child is provided with three distinct types of linguistic inputs: two languages, each in an unmixed/pure form, and one with a mixture of two languages. Given this state of affairs, how does the child learn to separate the two languages in question? This task is not challenging for a monolingual child because only one language serves as a source of input. The two hypotheses which attempt to shed light on this question are the unitary system hypothesis and the dual system hypothesis.
According the unitary system hypothesis (Volterra and Taeschner, 1978), the child undergoes three stages before s/he is able to separate two input languages. During the first two stages, the child experiences confusion. During the first stage, s/he is unable to distinguish the two lexicons and grammars of the linguistic systems. At this stage, they have a single lexicon made up of items drawn from the lexicons of both languages. Hence, no translational equivalents

or synonyms are found in their vocabulary. Volterra and Taeschner claim that their two bilingual subjects at the ages of 1 year 10 months and 1 year 6 months had a hybrid list of 137 words with no translational equivalents. During the second stage, the child slowly learns to separate the two lexicons, but is still unable to separate the grammatical systems. Cross-linguistic synonyms emerge, but the child applies the same set of syntactic rules to both languages. It is only during the third stage that the child becomes capable of separating the two sets of vocabularies and grammars. Findings of recent research reveal that the unitary system hypothesis cannot sustain the scrutiny of the succeeding research and the evidence motivating the three stages of bilingual language development is full of shortcomings and contradictions both on methodological and empirical grounds.
The dual system hypothesis states that bilingual children, based on their access to Universal Grammar and language specific parameter setting, have the capacity of separating the two grammars and lexical systems right from the beginning. A wide variety of crosslinguistic studies (e.g., different input conditions – one parent/one language and mixed input condition; and different word order types) lends support to this hypothesis. For instance, in a study devoted to the language development of a Hindi-English bilingual child, it is clear that at age 2, the child is capable of developing two distinct lexicons using a syllabification strategy. At the age of 1 year 7 months, two different word orders develop – SVO [subject-verbobject] for English and SOV for Hindi. For a more detailed treatment of the shortcomings of the unitary system hypothesis and the strengths of the dual system hypothesis, see Bhatia and Ritchie 1999: 591–614.
Another fascinating feature of bilingual speech is that, not only are bilinguals capable of keeping the two linguistic systems separate, but they often mix them either within a sentence or inter-sententially. This behavior is often termed ‘code-mixing’ or ‘codeswitching’ in sociolinguistic literature. Depending upon the theoretical and empirical objectives of their research, some researchers do not distinguish between the two terms and use them interchangeably; for those researchers who distinguish between the two, the code-mixing refers to intra-sentential mixing while the term code-switching refers to the intersentential mixing in bilinguals. Both bilingual children as well as adults show this behavior. What explains this behavior of language mixing? Earlier research attempted to explain it in terms of the language deficiency hypothesis: it was claimed that bilinguals in general and children in particular have language gaps. As claimed by the unitary system hypothesis the lack

Bilingualism and Second Language Learning 53

of synonyms compels them to mix the two lexical systems during stage I. Similarly, stage II yields the mixing of two language systems due to confusion. In other words, the lack of proficiency in either one language (i.e., the absence of balanced bilingualism) or both languages (i.e., semi-bilingualism) leads to mixing.
The language augmentation hypothesis is capable of offering deeper insights into the bilingual mixing behavior. As it has been shown earlier in the discussion of the dual system hypothesis, children do not go through the initial stages of treating the two linguistic systems as if they were one system, but begin to distinguish them immediately. The consideration of optimization leads bilinguals to mix language with an aim to get maximum mileage from the two linguistic systems at their disposal. An analogy drawn from the beverage industry further explains this point. The separation of juices (e.g., apple vs. orange juice) renders two distinct tastes. However, if one mixes the two juices, the result is a new taste, a distinct from the two pure juices. The same is true of bilingual language mixing. Research on the linguistic and sociolinguistic motivations for language mixing both in children and adults shows that such considerations as semantic domains and semantic complexity (an item less complex or salient in one language), stylistic effects, clarification, elaboration, relief strategy (i.e., a linguistic item is temporarily unavailable in one language), interlocutor’s identification, discourse strategies of participants/topics, addressee’s perceived linguistic capability and speaker’s own linguistic ability, and other complex socio-psychological reasons, such as attitudes, societal values, and personality, prompt bilinguals to mix two languages. The list of motivations is by no means exhaustive (see Bhatia and Ritchie, 1996, for more details).
Adult Bilingualism: Second Language Learning
In contrast to sequential childhood bilingualism, adults who learn a second language after they have learned their mother tongue experience the learning of a second language as a laborious and conscious task. As pointed out earlier, unlike children who are able to universally and uniformly acquire native competency in their mother tongue, adults rarely achieve native-like competency in their second language. Depending on the level of their motivation and hard work, adults can learn a second language with varying degrees of competence. However, there comes a point during the second language learning that even the most talented learner cannot pass the stage of ‘fossilization.’ This stage is marked with second language errors which no amount of training can

correct. For these reasons, second language (L2) learning is viewed as fundamentally different from first language (L1) acquisition. The hypothesis which aims at accounting for these differences between the child and the adult language is termed the fundamental difference hypothesis.
In spite of the asymmetrical relation between L1 and L2 learning, one should not draw a conclusion that there is nothing in common between the two. What is common between L1 and L2 learners is that both undergo stages of language development. In other words, like L1 learners, in the process of grammar construction, L2 learners undergo stages of development: the intermediate stages of grammar development between the initial stage and the ultimate stage are termed interlanguage grammars. Take the case of the development of negation in English L1 and L2 learners. The grammar of negation in L2 learners of English shows the same stages of development as in L1 English learners – Stage I: the sentenceinitial placement of negation; Stage II: preverbal placement of negation with no auxiliary verb; and Stage III: preverbal placement of negation with an appropriate auxiliary verb.
Native Language Influence and Dominance
An important way in which L2 learning is different from L1 learning is the influence of the mother tongue on second-language learning. The mother tongue or L1 plays an important role in the process of L2 acquisition. Research on grammatical errors of L2 shows that L2 learners transfer the grammatical rules – phonetic, phonological, morphological, and syntactic rules – of L1 to their second language. An Englishspeaking learner of Hindi has difficulties in hearing and producing a four-way contrast between Hindi aspiration and voicing contrast (i.e., unvoiced unaspirates, unvoiced aspirates, voiced unaspirates, and voiced aspirates).
It would be a gross simplification to claim that L2 learners transfer all grammatical features of L1 to L2. Adult learners possess a relatively higher level of logical and cognitive ability than do children; therefore, these qualities color their second language learning. For instance, English-speaking learners of Hindi will not translate there in these sentences:
1. There is a chair in the room 2. The chair is over there
in an identical way (i.e. by choosing the remote locative adverb in both cases). Similarly, it would be an oversimplification to claim that childhood bilingualism is free from the dominance relationship between the two languages. Not only does the mother tongue

54 Bilingualism and Second Language Learning

influence second language acquisition in children, it also affects their school achievement.
Approaches to Second Language Learning
In adult language acquisition research, the term second language is used in a wider sense to include both the acquisition of a second language which may or may not be foreign to a country. However, in the context of language teaching the distinction between the two is made to highlight major differences in the learning aims, teaching methods, and the achievement levels to be attained.
A number of approaches have been developed to facilitate the learning of second/foreign languages. Some of the following are notable:
1. Grammar-translation method: Following the tradition of teaching classical languages such as Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit, this method places emphasis on memorization and rote learning. Learners memorize nominal and verbal paradigms of the second language and translate L1 into L2 or vice versa. Very little emphasis is placed on developing spoken proficiency in the foreign language, while reading and written comprehension receives overwhelming importance. This method is perhaps the oldest method of language teaching which dates back to the 19th century.
2. The direct method: Also known as oral or natural methods, it departs from the grammar-translation method in three important respects: one, memorization receives a back seat in the learning of the second language; two, special emphasis is placed on acquiring spoken and listening competencies; and three, the introduction of the target language is free from any reference to the native language of learners. Native language is never used as a tool to explain either grammar or other intricacies of the target language usage. This model attempts to simulate the native speaker environment of the target language. However, in actual practice there are severe constraints on replicating the natural setting of the native speaker’s learning environment in an actual classroom setting.
3. The audio-lingual method is a byproduct of World War II during which the United States experienced an urgent need to quickly train its troops in foreign languages for overseas military operations. An emphasis is placed on spoken and listening competencies, rather than on written ones.
4. The structural method: In order to speed up the acquisition of foreign languages, insights of structural linguistics were applied to language teaching. This method exposes learners to different structural patterns and transformation drills.

Audio-lingual structural models assume that L2 is acquired through imitation. The discussion in the key concept section shows the limitation of this model. A number of other methods such as the natural approach and ‘suggestopedia’ have been proposed, but the fact remains that no method has a grip on the complexity involving learning a second language.
Bilingual Education: Additive vs. Subtractive Bilingualism
Teaching children a school language, particularly if the school language is different from the child’s home language, is one of the major challenges for bilingual education programs. Bilingual education programs in America aim at minority students learning English. Such programs have attracted a great deal of controversy on the basis of their merit and outcome. While there is rapid growth of bilingual education programs in the United States, the aim of such programs is not always to introduce additive bilingualism which ensures the maintenance of the child mother tongue, while learning the school/dominant language. A large number of bilingual education programs in the United States aim at subtractive bilingualism. In other words, while they offer children a transition to learning the school/majority language, in that process they do not ensure the maintenance of the child’s mother tongue.
In contrast, the language policies of bilingual nations such as India, Canada, and Switzerland are very conducive to the promotion of language rights for minority languages. The government of India, for instance, favors the advancement of linguistic diversity and pluralism by the introduction of the Three Language Formula, which calls for trilingualism in education. In addition to learning two national languages, Hindi and English, students are expected to learn a third language beyond their native tongue. For example, in northern India, students are expected to learn one of the four Dravidian languages (Tamil, Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam) from southern India.
While bi- or multi-lingual education programs like India’s do not view bilingualism in general and the maintenance of minority languages in particular as a threat to national integration, this is not the case with bilingual education in the United States. U.S. educational policies are not conducive to linguistic and cultural diversity.
A notable feature of the Canadian bilingual education program is termed the language immersion program. Introduced in the 1960s in Quebec, the program was introduced at the request of the English-speaking minority to provide their children

Bilingualism and Second Language Learning 55

a high level of proficiency in schools in the dominant language of the region, French. Children were immersed in schools in the second language of students (i.e., French) in which children used their mother tongue to communicate with a bilingual teacher who would reply in French. This process leads children from what Cummins (1981) calls basic interpersonal communication skills (BICS) proficiency to cognitive-academic language proficiency (CALP) in the school language. BICS refers to the language proficiency level of students with restricted vocabulary and simpler syntax, whereas CALP requires a type of proficiency suitable for academic pursuits – a developed vocabulary and sufficiently complex syntax suited for abstract and analytical thinking. The success of the Canadian language immersion model continues to generate enthusiasm and controversy in bilingual education in the United States.
Socio-Psychological Factors
Successful language learning not only depends on teaching methods but also on learners’ motivation, intelligence, opportunities, and other factors, such as their attitude toward the target language and culture. Keeping in mind the motivation and the learners’ attitudes, there are two types of learners: instrumental and integrative learners. Instrumental learners, who learn a language for the purpose of gaining external rewards (monitory gains, good jobs, etc.), however, tend to be less successful learners than integrative learners, who have a positive attitude toward the culture of the target language. Psychological factors such as the affective filter (Krashen, 1985) either inhibit or promote the learning of a second language: negative influences such as anxiety, lack of self-confidence, and inadequate motivation can create serious obstacles to successful language learning. Due to a lack of self-esteem and a higher level of performance anxiety, minority children tend to raise the affective filter, which results in the reduction of comprehensible input. Consequently, it takes a toll on their progress in language acquisition. Similarly, since adults show more self-consciousness than children, they put themselves in a disadvantageous position in terms of language acquisition.
Effects of Bilingualism
Does bilingualism have an adverse linguistic and cognitive effect, particularly on children? Earlier research in the United States pointed out that exposing children to more than one language during their childhood leads them to semi-bilingualism and confusion. Crowding their brain with two or more languages,

this research suggested, not only leads children to linguistic deficiency, both in competence and performance levels (semi-lingualism, stuttering, etc.), but also to a wide variety of cognitive and psychological impairments such as low intelligence, mental retardation, left-handedness, and even schizophrenia.
Research by Peal and Lambert (1962), however, put to rest such a negative view of bilingualism: their findings and the work of succeeding researchers provide ample evidence that these negative conclusions of earlier research were premature, misguided (biased toward immigrant communities), and unnecessarily pessimistic. Solid on methodological grounds, Peal and Lambert’s study revealed a positive view of bilingualism, including the conclusion that bilingual children demonstrate more cognitive flexibility than monolinguals. Contrary to previous studies, bilinguals performed better than monolinguals in both verbal and non-verbal measures. The study, which was conducted in Montreal, was revolutionary in its own right, changing the face of research on bilingualism forever (see Hakuta, 1985: Chap. 2 for details). This study has been replicated in a number of countries confirming the positive effects of bilingualism.
Conclusions
A number of diverse and complex conditions and factors lead to life-long bilingualism. These factors – biological, social, psychological, and linguistic – account for a varied pattern amongst bilinguals, witnessed around the world. Thus, a bilingual is neither two monolinguals in the brain, nor are two bilinguals clones of each other. These complexities indicate why no theory of language learning and/or teaching is capable of explaining bilingual verbal behavior and the mechanisms leading to bilingual language development.

Jerome Bruner is a pre-eminent, powerfully influential, and multiply pioneering psychologist whose studies have touched on language in many ways.
Born in New York City of nominally observant Jewish parents, he was blind for the first two years of life. His father, a watchmaker, died when he was 12, after which his family moved about, and he developed his interest in sailing. He attended Duke University (B.A., 1937), and went to Harvard for graduate study in psychology (Ph.D., 1941). He served in the U.S. Army Intelligence Corps in World War II, applying his knowledge of propaganda and public opinion. He then joined the Harvard faculty, doing experimental psychological research on the dependence of perception on motivation (the ‘New Look’ studies). He carried out an enormously influential series of studies on the acquisition of structured cognitive categories, involving the grouping of instances on the basis of values of defining attributes. He founded and directed the Center for Cognitive Studies in the 1960s, leading the way toward the field’s mentally realistic engagement with information processing. He left Harvard for the Watts Professorship of Experimental Psychology, at Wolfson College, Oxford University, in 1972, personally sailing across the Atlantic to assume his new role, and then returning to the United States in 1979. He has subsequently taught at the New School for Social Research (New York City) and

the New York University School of Law. His research interests progressed from cognitive to developmental and educational psychology, where his thinking has galvanized our understanding of pedagogical practice, and then on to cultural and narrative psychology, providing specimen studies exemplifying another novel and productive paradigm for human studies.
His abiding interest in language began with his work on wartime propaganda and public opinion, more or less by-passed his perceptual experiments, and continued with his analyses of conceptual categorization. Despite personal contacts with George A. Miller, Noam Chomsky, Roman Jakobson, and Roger Brown, he never became enamored of the structural properties of syntactic or phonological grammars. For instance, it was Brown who added a 65-page appendix to A study of thinking, indicating how attributes and categorizations are involved in speech and linguistic meaning.
He became interested in language development, as epitomizing a symbolic, in contrast to iconic or enactive, system of representation and cultural ‘amplifier’ of reflective, in contrast to sensory or motoric, capacities. From language as an instrument of thought, based on semantic representation, he went on to treat language development in terms of communicative (or pragmatic) function. This perspective allowed him to combine prior American pragmatic and generative influences, with Oxfordian ‘ordinary language’ work on Austinian illocutionary acts, as well as Tinbergen’s ethology – in his delineation of the ontogenesis of speech acts. He went on to the formulation of

Bu¨ hler, Karl 57

the Language Acquisition Support System, through which speakers became participants with particular linguistic communities or subcommunities. In this way, he could emphasize not only cultural influences, but also narrative structures and processes. He based his account of stories on Kenneth Burke’s pentad (Agents, Actions, Goals, Instruments, Settings – plus Trouble!), as well as other structural accounts and hermeneutic modes of human intentionality. Narratives, thus conceived, have properties that allow construction of personal selves/identities, as well as human institutions (such as schools and legal systems), and provide for the dynamics of individual development/aging and or human history (the passing forward of culture).
His prolific career has provided contributions sufficient to suggest several approaches to the role of language in the human sciences, but reflects a general trend from the application of his original experimental psychology to his more recent anthropological/ interpretive stance. He has managed to combine an engagement in current political, educational, and legal issues, as they have become crucial over the decades, with a principled perspective stemming from meaning-based psychological research and theory – which he has helped shape and vitalize. His

has not been a ‘school of psycholinguistics,’ but rather a schooling of psychological engagement in human language.

Karl Bu¨ hler (see Figure 1) was born in Germany (Meckesheim) in 1879 and, after gaining a doctorate in philosophy and medicine, started work as an assistant to Oswald Ku¨ lpe, a psychologist in Wu¨ rzburg. Later he worked as a professor of psychology in Dresden and Vienna (1922–1938), before having to emigrate to the United States in 1938, where he lived in Los Angeles from 1945 until his death in 1963.
In linguistics Bu¨ hler is most famous for his work on deixis and on language function, but he also published work on developmental psychology, language comprehension, and human cognition as well as on other linguistic phenomena such as phonology, syntax, morphology, and stylistics.
Bu¨ hler postulated four axioms for linguistics, which were concerned with (1) the organon model of language, (2) the sign status of language (by virtue of abstract features), (3) the field structure of

language (Bu¨ hler united von Humboldt’s dichotomy of ergon and energeia and de Saussure’s distinction between langue and parole in his Vierfelderschema of language as Sprechhandlung, Sprachwerk, Sprechakt, and Sprachgebilde), and (4) the fact that language is a system of two ‘classes’ (Zweiklassensystem), namely semantics and syntax. Of these four axioms, it was especially the organon model that was influential.
The Organon Model
In his Organonmodell Bu¨ hler took up Plato’s proposal to explain language by virtue of the metaphor of language as a tool (Greek o´ rganon) that serves distinct functions in society. He distinguished between three functions: Darstellung (‘representation’), Ausdruck (‘expression’), and Appell (‘vocative’, ‘appellative’). In very simple terms, language may be used for the representation of things (Dinge: Darstellung), for the expression of the speaker’s inner feelings/states (Sender: Ausdruck), and for influencing the hearer’s behavior (Empfa¨ nger: Appell). The linguistic sign is hence functionally very complex: it is a

expressive function has also been interpreted as referring to intentional linguistic communication.

symbol by virtue of its representational function, a symptom (sign, index) by virtue of its dependence on the sender, and a signal by virtue of its appeal to the hearer. In a given instance, one of these functions may dominate the others: Darstellung dominates in scientific language, Ausdruck in poetic language, and Appell in military language, but this does not mean that the other functions are not present as well (Bu¨ hler speaks of Dominanzpha¨ nomene). Thus, an expression such as es regnet (‘it’s raining’) denotes a meteorological event (Darstellung). But by uttering it with different intonations, the speaker can also express his/her feelings (Ausdruck) or appeal to someone not to forget to bring an umbrella (Appell) (1982: 46). Because of Bu¨ hler’s occasionally imprecise style of writing, aspects of this model remain muchdiscussed in European linguistics. For instance, it is not clear to what extent means of Ausdruck are employed intentionally or subconsciously and to what extent they are conventionalized. Although some of his examples include conventional and intentional expressions, Ausdruck is defined by him as ‘‘freie oder gehemmte Entladung von Affekten’’ (1982: 352), i.e., the free or inhibited discharge of emotions, which seems to more or less subconsciously ‘mirror’ the speaker’s mental state or personality traits (Auer, 1999: 33). From a strict viewpoint, this function thus does not concern linguistics (Konstantinidou, 1997: 36; cf. also Pe´ ter, 1984: 245; Stankiewicz, 1964: 239f.); however, Bu¨ hler’s

The ‘Field Theory’ of Language
Bu¨ hler also developed his own contextual language theory, the Zweifelderlehre (‘two-field theory’). Signs, he said, are not isolated entities but always occur in context, in a ‘field’ that can be deictic (Zeigfeld) or symbolic (Symbolfeld). As such, linguistic signs function as Feldgera¨ te (‘field tools’). Representational symbols can be interpreted solely with the help of the Symbolfeld, but in order to assign meaning to utterances containing deictic signals (Zeigwo¨ rter), hearers need the extralinguistic context (the Zeigfeld). What is designated by expressions such as here, there, I, you changes according to the position of the speaker. Thus, it is the I, now, and here that establishes the deictic center (Bu¨ hler calls it the Ichjetzt-hier-Origo). The matter is more complicated because there are several modi of pointing toward the context of utterance: ad oculos (reference to components of the current context), anaphorisch (reference to textual components), and am Phantasma (reference to fictional worlds).
Bu¨ hler’s contribution to linguistics is enormous: apart from crucially influencing linguistic research (especially the Prague School) before World War II, his work has been of great importance in linguistics since the ‘pragmatic turn’ in the 1970s, although he failed to gain the deserved attention upon his emigration to the United States. His Organonmodell has been immensely significant in that it influenced the establishment of derived functional models from Roman Jakobson to Dell Hymes and M.A.K. Halliday. He is still being reinterpreted and analyzed within modern linguistics (e.g., Kubczak, 1984; Pe´ter, 1984; Auer, 1999). Similarly, his comments on deixis, morphology, and metaphor have provided a stepping stone for modern approaches in these fields. His estate is currently being reorganized by the FDO¨ P (Forschungsstelle und Dokumentationszentrum fu¨ r o¨ sterreichische Philosophie).

analysis of language as the medium for power and control, ideology, and truth in specific linguistic and capital markets (see Power and Pragmatics).

The relationship between language and social class is a key theoretical and empirical issue in critical discourse studies, ethnography of communication, and sociolinguistic research. It has been a focal point for postwar and current policy in language planning, and language and literacy education. The central questions of a class analysis of language were stated in Mey’s (1985) proposal for Marxian pragmatics: ‘Whose language’ counts? With what material and social consequences? For which communities and social groups? Central concerns are how language factors into the intergenerational reproduction of social and economic stratification, and how communities, families, schools, the media, and governments contribute to ‘‘linguistic inequality’’ (Hymes, 1996). Yet current research continues to table and debate contending definitions of language and social class as social and economic phenomena.
Marx viewed language as an intrinsic characteristic of human ‘species being,’ as a form of mental and material labor. The ‘‘language of real life,’’ he argued, is ‘‘directly interwoven’’ with ‘‘material activity and. . . mental intercourse’’ (Marx and Engels, 1845/1970: 118). This ‘‘mental production’’ is ‘‘expressed in the language of politics, laws, morality, religion, metaphysics etc. of a people.’’ ‘Sense experience,’ the work of the eye and ear, was the basis not only of science, but of communal and social life (Marx, 1844/1964: 160–166). At the same time, Marx’s (Marx and Engels, 1845/1970: 37) classical definition of ideology as a ‘camera obscura’ established the centrality of language in the distortion and misrepresentation of social and economic reality in social class interests (see Marxist Theories of Language).
Marxist theory establishes three critical traditions in the analysis of language and class. These are: (1) the analysis of language as a form of class-based social action and consciousness; (2) the analysis of social class and linguistic variation; and (3) the

Language as Social Action and Class Consciousness
The prototypical class analysis of language was undertaken by Voloshinov (1973) (see Voloshinov, Valentin Nikolaevich). Language was conceptualized as a marker of class consciousness and a medium of class struggle. According to models of heteroglossia and ‘multivocality,’ each utterance and text is a revoicing of previous historical speakers and writers. The ideological content and social functions of each speech act or speech genre bear their own material historical origins. That is, they are produced and reproduced by and through social and economic ‘‘conditions of production’’ (Fairclough, 1992). By this account, faceto-face language exchanges are instances of class conflict and ideological difference, where class-located social actors bring to bear distinctive material interests and discourse positions. The point of such analysis is to extend the notion of the situated speaking and writing subject, to a closer sociological and economic analysis of that positionality. Contemporary work in critical discourse analysis supplements class analysis with attention to the linguistic construction of gender, race, sexual preference, and other forms of social identity ideology, and position (e.g., Lemke, 1995).
If utterances and their use are indexical of ideology and social class consciousness, what might this mean for differing cultural groups, communities, and their historical practices? Following Vygotsky (see Vygotskij, Lev Semenovich), Luria (1982) argued that the cognitive uses of the ‘tool’ of language were mediated by one’s social relations, cultural practices, and material conditions. In his studies of the Uzbeks, Luria made the claim that particular forms of cognition and consciousness, what Marx referred to as capacity for the ‘‘production of ideas,’’ were linked to cultural practices and material conditions of tool use. The cognitive affordances of language and literacy are

62 Class Language

mediated by material economic and social conditions, including class location and cultural history.
In contemporary literacy theory, Paulo Freire also argued for the direct links between language and social class consciousness. Freire’s (1972) prototypical work was concerned with the effects of literacy education upon the language and consciousness of the indigenous population and peasantry of postwar Brazil. Bringing together Marxist dialectics with liberation theology, he argued that autocratic governments and education systems constituted ‘‘cultures of silence’’ where marginalized populations were educated in ways that misnamed and misrecognized the world. Freire’s work views ideologically distorted language as a mode of class-based false consciousness.
For Freire, critique of class consciousness was achieved through an educational process of ‘renaming’ the world in ways that demystified power, consciousness, and life, a similar agenda to that of Mey (1985), Chouliaraki and Fairclough (2001) and other contemporary critical linguists. Current agendas for the teaching of ‘critical literacy’ and critical discourse analysis stand in this Marxist tradition, focusing on the demystification, critique, and reconstruction of ideological language (Luke, 2004).
Linguistic Variation and Social Class
A further concern in the analysis of language and social class is how language variation acts as a marker and instrument of social class, and of racial and other forms of social stratification. A principal concern of sociolinguists in the postwar period has been over the effects of the differential and inequitable spread of economic and social capital on the language minority, postcolonial, and economically marginal communities (Hymes, 1996) (see Minority Languages: Oppression). The postwar origins of language planning reflect the impact of colonization, decolonization, migration, and geopolitical conflict upon linguistic retention and stability. The flow of global, regional, and national capital visibly impacts upon language loss, use, and retention (Pennycook, 1998). In the postwar period, sociolinguistic and language planning research has engaged with the effects of the unequal spread and distribution of economic capital upon language loss. Yet attempts to theorize and empirically describe the complex reproductive relationships of language and social class have been debated and contested (see Linguistic Decolonialization).
The sociological and sociolinguistic research on U.K. children by Basil Bernstein and colleagues (e.g., Bernstein, 1975) took up this challenge. This work provided an account of the role of language in the

institutional production of stratified levels of educational achievement. Bernstein’s argument was that working class students spoke a ‘‘restricted code,’’ characterized by embedded and literal meanings, limited command of deixis, and thresholds in technical complexity. Middle-class children, he argued, mastered an ‘‘elaborated code’’ which was fitted for educational success and mastery of academic and scientific discourses. These, he argued, were tied to particular forms of early childhood language socialization and family structure (Bourdieu and Passeron, 1992). Bernstein’s work was the object of several decades of controversy. Labov’s (2001) studies of urban African-American language registers and nonstandard dialects, and Heath’s (1983) studies of early class-based language socialization made the case against models of linguistic deficit. Bernstein’s model has been defended by systemic functional linguists, who argue that there are indeed elaborated technical registers and contents, specific language domains affiliated with power, some of which particular social classes make explicitly available in early language socialization and educational training (Hasan and Williams, 1996) (see Codes, Elaborated and Restricted).
As distinctive sociodemographic speech communities, particular social classes may indeed have different speech patterns, varying in lingua franca, register, dialect, accent, and practices of diglossia (see Register: Overview). These, further, are affiliated with class-based social ideologies and cultural practices (Fishman, 1991). Ethnographic studies have shown how these variations are made to count in local social networks and institutions (Milroy, 1987). But the social and cultural bases and material consequences of such differences remain localized and contentious. To move past descriptive claims requires a broader sociological theory of social class, of ‘‘linguistic markets’’ (Mey, 1985; Bourdieu, 1992), and of changing media and modes of production and information.
Language as Capital in Linguistic Markets
Classical sociological definitions of social class begin from conceptions of structural economic location and material position. They attempt to define position and power vis-a` -vis dominant means of production. The tendency of Marxist models is to further affiliate social class with particular ‘class consciousness,’ of which language, its use and its expression, is a constitutive speech marker. Bourdieu’s (1992) sociology began from a view that class position is at least in part structurally determined. But it is also embodied

Class Language 63

by human subjects in their ‘habitus,’ the sum total of socially acquired dispositions.
By this account, the bodily performance of linguistic competence is an element of cultural capital. This capital and affiliated forms of embodied taste, style, and ideology, constitute a key marker of one’s social class position and mobility. Linguistic capital is deployed in specific social fields, which constitute ‘linguistic markets.’ Each market, each institutional context, in turn has variable rules and conventions of exchange whereby linguistic competence and literate proficiency in specific languages is valued or not. There, language use – as class marker and tool – has exchange value and power only in relation to other forms of capital, including social capital (e.g., networks, institutional access), economic capital, formal institutional credentials, artifacts, and so forth.
This is a more complex view of the relationship of language and social class. Language matters, as a primary marker of class, gender, culture, training, education, networks, traditions, and ideological consciousness. Yet like post-structuralist theories of discourse, Bourdieu’s model viewed language not just as an index or marker of class position, but as reflexively constituting position and identity, power, and categorical social status. In this way, how language marks class, capital, and power is sociologically contingent, rather than determined by the characteristics of linguistic code or class position per se, or the ostensive power of any given utterance, genre, or text (Luke, 1996). This contingency is dependent on the availability of other forms of capital, and the variable, historically shifting norms, rules, and conventions of particular social institutions, fields of knowledge, and linguistic markets (see Discourse, Foucauldian Approach).
Current Issues
One of the principal critiques of postwar sociolinguistics, ethnography of communication, and functional linguistics was that they lacked a sufficient analysis of power, capital, and conflict. Indeed, sociolinguistic models of ‘social context,’ ‘context of situation,’ and ‘social network’ are often based on structural functionalist models of society and culture. The study of language and social class requires the rigorous analysis of social and economic relations within and between speech communities. Current work on language and social class continues to examine how language represents class consciousness, how it is implicated in ongoing issues of class conflict and cohesion, and how its acquisition and use are central to intergenerational production of social stratification of material and discourse resources.

Language variation, diversity, change, and ideology can be systematically linked to social class. Linguistic performance in text and discourse production does indeed have both symbolic and material exchange value, particularly in service- and information-based economies. But this depends upon the complex local economic and institutional formations of particular speech communities. Bourdieu offered a stronger analytic frame for analyzing how language ‘counts’ in specific institutional, disciplinary, and knowledge fields, and everyday social contexts. He suggested that issues around ‘whose language’ counts, which classes have power, require a rigorous socioeconomic analysis. Particularly under conditions of late capitalism and globalization, these sociological and sociolinguistic contexts and conditions are under considerable historical transition and challenge.
As the medium of consciousness and labor, language is entailed in the production of ideology, material goods, and social relations. The move in globalized economies towards information- and discourse-based forms of labor raises a number of key challenges to linguistic and ethnographic studies. First, linguistic, semiotic, and discourse competence will have increased significance in productive labor and consumption, shifting social class relations to means of production. Second, social class location and membership is determined by relations to dominant modes of communication, semiosis, and information (Castells, 2000) as much as it might be defined in classical Marxist terms. Finally, the formation of social class identity, ideology, and speech community have become more complex. They are now strongly influenced by forces of mass culture, media, and globalized information flows.
One of the principal claims of post-structuralist and postmodern theory of the past decade has been a breakdown of essential relationships between discourse and social class as a primary analytic category. It is increasingly difficult to analyze social class formation without due consideration of the complexity of cultural, racial, gender, and religious identity and position. Any analysis of language and social class must engage with this complexity. But indeed, any contemporary analysis of class and intersecting categories must engage with the constitutive place of language, text, and discourse.

Classroom Talk

Much classroom activity takes the form of talk. In recent decades, studies of teacher and student spoken language in the classroom have been undertaken from a variety of perspectives in applied linguistics, education, ethnography, and ethnomethodology. In particular, the analyses of talk between the teacher and the students, as well as among students, seek to understand how the spoken language and the discourse of the classroom affect learning (including language learning) and the development of sociocultural affiliation and identity (e.g., WatsonGegeo, 1997).
To a great extent, spoken language and face-toface interaction constitute the foundational aspects of both teaching and learning at school. Although specialists in education and teaching first became

interested in the impact of classroom discourse and interaction on students’ learning and the development of cognitive skills in the 1930s and 1940s, since that time, research on classroom talk has moved forward in a number of directions. In the study of language and applied linguistics, classroom talk has been the subject of considerable exploration in discourse, conversation, and text analyses, as well as sociolinguistic and sociocultural features of interaction.
The linguistic features of classroom talk were studied intensively in the 1970s and 1980s, when the uses of language and forms of interaction at school became an important venue in discourse, pragmatic, and literacy studies. Many of the early discourse analyses focused on the linguistic features of talk, narrative structure, common speech acts, their sequences, and the contexts in which they occurred, as well as the flow of classroom speech (e.g., Sinclair and Coulthard, 1975; Stubbs, 1983). As a matter of course, these studies approached classroom talk as

Classroom Talk 65

occurrences of conversational discourse, without attempting to discern the effect of the language spoken in the classroom on student learning and the educational processes. The analyses of the discourse flow and the language of interaction revealed that classroom talk is highly structured and routinized.
Building on the discourse-analytic foundation, the influential work of such sociolinguists and cognitive linguists as Cazden (2001), Gumperz (1982, 1986), Edwards and Mercer (1987), and Edwards and Westgate (1994) employed a combination of methodological perspectives in their explorations of the spoken discourse, language, and the structure of interaction in schooling. In general terms, sociolinguistics takes into account the social contexts and the structure of interaction to determine how they shape the spoken language. Sociolinguistic research methods in the classroom are usually complemented by ethnographic and pragmatic perspectives. Taken together, the findings of these studies have brought to the foreground issues of power, socioeconomic class, culture, and the social construction of experience in the classroom. Many, if not most, of these investigations point to the common and frequent mismatches between the normative properties of the school language and the language used in students’ families.
A number of important and congruent findings have emerged from the study of classroom discourse and spoken language. One prominent thread in research is that a large majority of classroom interactions occur between the teacher and the students, individually or in groups, although some student–student interactions also take place during group or collaborative activities. Investigations carried out in different locations and countries around the world have shown that in classroom interactions, teachers talk approximately 75% of the time, with the remainder divided among the students. This pattern of talk seems to be comparatively consistent and, on the whole, resistant to change, despite the calls for its modification or attempted educational reforms (e.g., van Lier, 1988, 1996; Dysthe, 1996; Nystrand, 1997).
Another strand that runs through practically all studies is that classroom talk includes a number of predictable and observable sequences. Much of the classroom spoken language centers around knowledge and information elicitation turns between the teacher and the students, cohesive topical stretches of talk, or exchanges motivated by instructional activity in the classroom. In general terms, teacher–student exchanges reflect the unequal and hierarchical relationship of their participants in teacher-fronted classrooms (Edwards and Westgate, 1994).
The typical conversational patterns in such dyadic exchanges proceed along the lines of what

has become known as Initiation-Response-Feedback (IRF) (also called Initiation-Response-Evaluation or Question-Answer-Comment), e.g.:
Teacher: So, why did Peter run to the village? Student: For a joke. Teacher: Right!
In such routine classroom sequences, the teacher initiates the interaction or asks a question, the student responds or answers the question, and the teacher takes the concluding turn that provides a commentary (e.g., So, Peter was bored) or an evaluation (e.g., Good/Great answer).
Spoken language in the classroom is fundamentally different from many other types of talk, such as conversations among peers, coworkers, or family members. Some researchers, such as, for example, Mehan (1979) and van Lier (1996), have pointed out that IRF interactions are, by their nature, artificial and constrained and, for this reason, they cannot be analyzed as ordinary conversational discourse that follows ordinary interactional conventions. In their view, the institutionalized structure of classroom talk is crucially distinct when the teacher nominates topics and speakers, and controls turn-taking and the amount of participant talk.
The decades of investigating talk in the classroom have also identified the social, cultural, and behavioral practices that predominate in classroom discourse. Numerous studies carried out in such locations as the United States, the United Kingdom, and Scandinavia have demonstrated that complex systems of sociocultural prescriptions and expectations that exist in the wider society are strongly reflected in the norms of speaking and behaving in the classroom. Influential works by, for example, Heath (1983) and Gee (1990), highlight the pervasive discontinuities between the middle-class linguistic and interactional practices widely adopted in schooling and those in children’s homes. The disparities between the rigidly prescribed and traditional rules of the classroom talk extend to the learning, socialization, and literacy development of the children in racially and linguistically diverse schools. Examples of language and interaction mismatches abound (e.g., Scollon and Scollon, 1981; Brock et al., 1998):
. Spanish-speaking students in the United States are not always familiar with the predominant norms of classroom behavior when students are expected to be quiet while the teacher or another student is speaking.
. Native American students often participate in class conversations collectively, but not individually, as is usually expected in U.S. and Canadian schools.

66 Classroom Talk

. Ethnic Chinese students in U.K. and Australian schools rarely speak during requisite classroom activities and strongly prefer to work alone instead of working in groups, where much conversation is required.
In all, a large number of sociolinguistic and ethnographic studies have shown conclusively that the practice of classroom talk and the rigid norms of interaction in schooling represent culturally bound contexts for learning. As an outcome, the learning and literacy development of racial and linguistic minority students can be constrained in the classrooms where the structure of talk and discourse follows sociocultural prescriptions different from those in the students’ communities outside the school.
From a different vantage point, research in discourse and conversation analysis, as well as language acquisition, has also shown that classroom talk has numerous important learning, cognitive, and social functions. The most common of these include exposure to language and linguistic input in the form of, for example, direct instruction, questions and answers, orientations to topics, information elicitations, explanations, hypothesis-making, and using evidence. In the following example of a story-circle discussion, the teacher attempts to elicit more elaborate explanations and evidential support for the students’ in effect accurate appraisal of the story events:
Teacher: Ok, so Laura got a pretty new dress ... . A very nice dress. She must have liked it. So, did she like it?
Several students together: Nooooooo. Teacher: She didn’t? Well, no, she didn’t ... . Eh, ok, ... so
how do we know that she didn’t? Sam: She said ... I ... I don’t need it ... it ... the new one.
So, she didn’t. Teacher: Good job, Sam, good thinking ... . Laura really
didn’t need this dress? Ok, or maybe, she didn’t like it? Can we tell? How can we tell?
In addition to guiding the students to support their conclusion by means of the information in the story, the teacher also uses relatively advanced syntactic constructions, such as must have liked it and a number of complex sentences with noun clauses and negation.
More recently, with the increased understanding of learners’ cognitive and linguistic development, investigations of classroom talk have continued to gain importance in language teaching and education of second language and minority students. In many cases, discourse and conversation analyses of classroom talk have also shown that language uses and interactions in educational contexts play an important role in learner language and cognitive development (see, e.g., Edwards and Westgate, 1994; Dysthe, 1996; Seedhouse, 2004). For instance, the uses of lexical and grammatical features in classroom talk

have allowed researchers to assess the value of classroom language exposure and input in language learning and the growth of first and second language literacy skills.
Among other venues, for example, the uses of display and referential questions in classroom talk have been extensively researched. The purpose of display questions is to elicit information already known to the interaction participant, who asks the question to lead to the display of knowledge or familiarity with information, e.g., ‘‘What do we call this thing?’’ On the other hand, referential questions elicit information that is not known to the speaker, e.g., ‘‘Why did you and Mary put this picture before that one?’’ Studies of referential questions have shown that their educational uses lead to different classroom exchanges that result in significantly longer speech events, higher rates of lexically and syntactically complex responses, and greater opportunities for learner language use (e.g., Edwards and Mercer, 1987; van Lier, 1996).
In-depth investigations of classroom talk have undertaken to gain insight into a large number of sociocultural and linguistic properties of interaction, such as equal and unequal power relationships, some aspects of turn-taking, talk management, and the timing and length of speech events (e.g., Markee, 2000). From the perspective of conversation analysis, classroom interactions have provided a fertile ground for examinations of repair, correction, selfcorrection, discourse, and face-saving markers in equal and unequal power educational contexts.
At present, sociologists, educators, and linguists almost universally recognize that social and cultural institutions of schooling are inseparable from how language and discourse are employed to transmit knowledge and socialize learners (e.g., WatsonGegeo, 1997; Cazden, 2001).

Code Switching

In many bi- and multilingual communities around the world, speakers need to choose, often at an unconscious level, which language to use in their interactions with other members of the community. One of the choices that bilingual speakers often make is to code-switch: that is, speakers switch back and forth between languages (or varieties of the same language), sometimes within the same utterance (see Bilingualism).
The motivations for code switching have often been treated simply as lists of possible functions for code switching. For example, Appel and Muysken (1987) cite five such functions. First, code switching may serve a referential function by compensating for the speaker’s lack of knowledge in one language, perhaps on a certain subject. Second, it may serve a directive function by including or excluding the listener. Third, code switching may have an expressive function by identifying the speaker as someone having a mixed cultural identity. Fourth, it may have a phatic function indicating a change in tone in the conversation. And fifth, it may serve a metalinguistic function when code switching is used to comment on the languages involved.

While such lists are useful places to start, and no one would deny that code switching can certainly serve these functions, these types of lists fail to answer the question of what motivates speakers to make the choices they do at a particular point in a conversation. This article reviews the major proposals that have been advanced regarding the following question: why do speakers choose to engage in code switching in the first place?
Code Switching as a Research Topic
The current interest in code switching can be dated to a 1972 study of language use in Hemnesberget, a small village in northern Norway, conducted by Jan Blom and John Gumperz and described in a volume on sociolinguistics edited by Gumperz and Hymes (1972). In Hemnesberget, two varieties of Norwegian are used: Ranama˚ l, a local dialect, and Bokma˚ l, the standard variety. However, speakers’ decisions regarding which variety to use are by no means arbitrary or haphazard. In general, Ranama˚ l, the local variety, is used in local activities and relationships, reflecting shared identities with the local culture. In contrast, Bokma˚ l is used in official settings such as school, church, and the media, communicating an individual’s dissociation from the local group, i.e., not stressing his or her local ties.
Blom and Gumperz distinguish between two main functions of code switching: situational and

68 Code Switching

metaphorical. In situational code switching, which seems to be similar to the notion of diglossia, the speaker’s choice of language is constrained by factors external to her/his own motivations, for example, the status of the interlocutor, the setting of the conversation, or the topic of conversation. So, in Hemnesberget, Blom and Gumperz observed that when an outsider joins a group of locals engaged in a conversation, the locals will often switch from the local variety, Ranama˚ l, to the standard variety, Bokma˚ l. In a later work, Gumperz (1982) introduces the distinction between ‘we’ and ‘they’ codes, which further amplifies the kind of linguistic alternation that occurs in situational code switching. ‘We’ codes are associated with home and family, while ‘they’ codes are associated with public discourse. In contrast to situational code switching, speakers may engage in a more complex type of code switching to create a ‘metaphoric’ effect. In his 1982 book, Gumperz explains that this metaphoric effect is a way for speakers to communicate ‘‘information about how they intend their words to be understood’’ (1982: 61). The classic example of metaphorical code switching from the Blom and Gumperz 1972 article is from a conversation at the local community administration office, where two villagers switch from the standard variety of Norwegian, in which they had been discussing official business, to the local variety to discuss family and other private affairs.
The Blom and Gumperz study is important because it illustrates that code switching is a complex, skilled linguistic strategy used by bilinguals to convey important social meanings above and beyond the referential content of an utterance. However, this is not to say that the Blom and Gumperz article has not generated some criticism over the years. In addition to some overlap and lack of clarity in the definitions of situational versus metaphorical switching, this model of code switching implies a sharp boundary between the two types of switching. In fact, Myers-Scotton (1993: 55) argues that the metaphorical meaning of a switched utterance is derived from its situationally based meaning. In any case, it is fair to say that this Blom and Gumperz study sparked an interest in studying code switching data in terms of a dynamic, interactional model that focuses on individual choices rather than static factors related to an individual’s social status (see Social Class and Status).
The Audience-Centered Approach to Code Switching
Using a social psychological theory of language use, Howard Giles and his associates have developed a model of interpersonal communication that considers

how speakers change the way they speak according to their audience. Giles refers to this type of strategy as accommodation (see Speech Accommodation Theory and Audience Design). Within Giles’s speech accommodation theory, speakers are motivated by their desire for approval vis-a`-vis their desire to dissociate themselves from the hearer. These concerns are cognitively salient and are realized by speech convergence (similar styles of speaking) or divergence (different styles of speaking). In fact, Giles predicted from these assumptions that the greater the effort in converging, the more favorably the individual will be evaluated by the listener. Thus, convergence and divergence are linguistic strategies to either decrease or increase social distance between participants in a conversation.
Although the premises behind speech accommodation theory have not been rigorously tested using code switching data in any comprehensive way, it is not difficult to see how the model could be used to explain speakers’ motivations for code switching. For example, to test the prediction regarding how listeners will evaluate a speaker based on the speaker’s perceived effort at converging, Giles et al. (1973) conducted an experiment involving bilingual English Canadian students who were asked to rate their reactions to a set of taped descriptions of a simple harbor scene given by bilingual French Canadian students. Different versions of this description – reflecting different levels of linguistic convergence to monolingual English – were presented to the English Canadian raters. The results of this experiment supported the prediction that the greater the effort in converging, the more favorably the speaker would be perceived. More specifically, the most convergent bilingual French Canadian student was viewed as the most considerate and the most concerned about bridging the cultural gap between French and English Canadians.
Speech accommodation theory has been successfully applied mainly in the contexts of dialect or style switching. However, the theory and its predictions still await further testing on code switching in bilingual settings.
The Conversation Analytic Approach to Code Switching
Both the Gumperz and the Giles models of code switching attend to extralinguistic factors such as topic, setting, and participants as influencing speakers’ linguistic choices in conversations. Peter Auer (1984) questioned these assumptions and specifically questioned the way ‘situation’ was defined. For Auer, situation was a not a static set of contextual features that constrain linguistic choices. Rather, situation was seen as a dynamic phenomenon, emerging from

Code Switching 69

the sequential nature of a conversational interaction. Using the terminology and the techniques of ethnomethodology and conversation analysis, Auer argued that the meaning behind code switching must be interpreted on the basis of the linguistic choices made by the participants themselves in the preceding and following turns in a conversation. In other words, for Auer, social meaning is constituted locally rather than at a societal level (see Conversation Analysis).
Studies that use the technique of conversation analysis typically assign no independent semantic value to either of the languages involved. Instead, the conversational meaning of code switching results from the mere juxtaposition of the two languages, which generates contextualization cues whereby participants signal various contextual presuppositions. Thus, this language switching has a value of its own, independent of the direction of code alternation.
Some have argued that an approach that focuses on the negotiation of meaning as locally constructed cannot generalize across interactions in order to build explanatory theories. However, Auer (1995) has identified several basic code switching patterns that correspond to identifiable meanings, such as participant-related alternations, which reflect language competence or preference on the part of the speaker, and discourse-related alternations, which signal, for example, topic change (among other functions). Nevertheless, most researchers still recognize that in multilingual communities, each language available in the community indexes specific social and interactional meanings, and listeners tend to attribute consistent interpretations to the particular language choices that speakers make (see Pragmatic Indexing).
The Marked Model: A Speaker-Centered Approach to Code Switching
One of the more richly developed models designed to explain the sociopragmatic motivations for code switching is Carol Myers-Scotton’s markedness model, which developed out of her field research in East Africa. The central premise of the markedness model is that speakers are rational actors who make code selections in such a way as to minimize costs and maximize rewards; that is, speakers are concerned with optimizing the outcomes of an interaction in their own favor.
This notion of the speaker as a rational actor making certain decisions about code choice, albeit at a largely unconscious level, is also evident in speech accommodation theory as well as in Gumperz’s approach to code switching. However, unlike these other models, which consign the primary motivation for code switching to the addressee or to some

other factor external to the speaker (e.g., topic or social setting), the markedness model is primarily a speaker-centered approach to communication.
Markedness and Communicative Competence
Within the marked model, all code choices fall along a continuum, as more or less marked or unmarked. With respect to bilingual speech, the unmarked choice simply refers to the linguistic variety that is expected, given the societal norms for that interaction. In contrast, marked choices fall at the other end of this continuum; that is, they are in some sense unusual or unexpected for the particular social interaction.
Furthermore, all speakers possess what MyersScotton calls a markedness evaluator, or the capacity to evaluate linguistic choices in terms of markedness, as part of their innate communicative competence (see Communicative Competence). While the capacity to assign markedness readings to linguistic choices is innate, the markedness continuum is established through exposure to the range of linguistic options used in the community.
Explaining Speakers’ Choices
All code choices can ultimately be explained in terms of speakers’ motivations to optimize the outcomes of the interaction. Most choices that speakers make affirm the norms that are in place for the particular exchange. These are unmarked choices, and they are usually the safest choices to make. The particular code used by the speaker is important only insofar as the participants view its status as marked or unmarked for that type of interaction. Thus, in a multilingual setting such as Nairobi, Kenya, the unmarked choice for most business transactions between strangers is Swahili. However, if the participants discover during the course of their conversation that they are members of the Luyia ethnic group, they will often switch into Luyia to continue the conversation. Luyia, then, becomes the unmarked choice, given the ethnic identity of the participants. However, code switching between Swahili and English within the same turn, within the same sentence, and even within words is typically the unmarked choice for informal social gatherings between educated, middleclass peers in Nairobi. Hence, the markedness of linguistic choices must be evaluated in terms of the norms for a particular exchange; the unmarked setting may even change within a conversation.
In contrast to the relative safety of unmarked choices, marked choices carry with them some element of risk for someone who wishes to defy the norms. Importantly, the interpretation that a marked choice receives derives from its contrast with the

70 Codes, Elaborated and Restricted

unmarked choice for that exchange. That is, the unexpectedness, the ‘otherness’ of a marked choice carries significant social meaning. Marked choices are typically used to redefine the relationship between the speaker and the addressee, often as an expression of the speaker’s authority or power, to indicate anger, or to assert one’s ethnic identity (see Identity and Language; Power and Pragmatics). All these strategies can be subsumed under a single general principle: speakers make marked choices to negotiate a change in the expected social distance between the participants, either increasing or decreasing it.
The Significance of the Markedness Model
Since its formulation, the markedness model has been successfully used to explain code switching between languages, between dialects and registers, and even between stylistic choices in literary contexts. The strength of the markedness model is its ability to explain not only unmarked choices, which other models do as well, but also its ability to explain marked choices. Furthermore, the markedness model addresses the universal aspects of communicative competence in terms of the cognitive abilities that use readings of markedness to assess speakers’ intentions. For these reasons, the markedness model is a powerful tool not only for code switching research, but also for any examination of the ways in which speakers use language to achieve interactional goals.

Bernstein was among the first scholars to focus on the correlation between the scholastic success (or failure) of a learner and the social class he or she belonged to. A student living in a well-off family, having many

cultural stimuli (books, newspapers, periodicals, films, etc.) is bound to develop a rich and fully articulated language (a so-called ‘elaborate code’), whereas a student who belongs to a working-class family and is exposed to poor linguistic and cultural stimuli, develops a fragmented, poor, syntactically deficient language (called a ‘restricted code’ by Bernstein) (see Bernstein, 1971–1975).

Cognitive Pragmatics 71

Regarding the Chomskyan theory that language naturally develops in the brain, due to the interaction of biologically innate structures and the environment to which the child is exposed, it may be the case that the data to which the child is exposed are so poor and confused that it is easy to demonstrate that the innate learning program prevails over the environmental stimuli, Bernstein therefore emphasizes the predominant role played by the environment in shaping the learning process. Of course, the correlation between social class is not, strictly speaking, without exceptions, because much of the learning process depends on the lifestyle of the family under consideration. There are exceptional working-class families where parents, contrary to all expectations, have good knowledge of the language and place great importance on culture, but the norm is that, within working-class families, cultural stimuli are less predominant than in more well-off families.
The problem, for sociologists, is how to offset the disadvantages of the pupils belonging to working-class families and how pedagogues (and teachers) can counteract such deterministic effects in the case of these children.
A possible solution to the problem is to ensure that the school (or the class) becomes another miniature family and that the negative effects of the families are compensated for by the pedagogical action of the school. The school should, therefore, be a positive environment in which pupils are exposed to positive cultural and affective stimuli that help their personalities grow and come to maturity. In such a model of the school, teachers lose their primary function of

being transmitters of notions (knowledge, in general) and are required to take the roles of educators or pedagogues who act as models and provisionally replace (at least within the boundaries of the school) the family by setting good examples for the students, and, in particular, exposing them to the positive aspects of culture, intended as knowledge that interacts with the individual to make him or her grow up intellectually and emotionally. To compensate for the negative effects of families, in which dialogue and conversation have died or are confined to adjacency pairs of questions/answers or orders/replies, teachers have to play the role of communicators and stimulate communication. It is, in my view, impossible for a student to make progress in his or her language (to develop a more articulated written or oral mode of expression) unless he or she understands the function of communication, which is that of transmitting knowledge, but also of enhancing the expressive as well as the interpersonal function. To communicate is not only to express propositions (concerning others), but also to express propositions concerning what we really are and feel, and, by so doing, to interact with others, creating an intersubjective dimension in which social life is possible (see Capone, 2003).

Introduction
Cognitive pragmatics is concerned with the mental processes involved in intentional communication. Typically, studies within this area focus on cognitive processes underlying the comprehension of a linguistic speech act and overlook linguistic production or extralinguistic communication.
As far as cognitive processes are concerned authors in this field are interested in both the inferential chains necessary to understand a communicator’s intention starting from the utterance he proffered and

the different mental representations underlying the comprehension of various communicative phenomena as cognitive processes. Thus, a theory in cognitive pragmatics aims to explain what mental processes a person actually engages in during a communicative interaction (see Shared Knowledge).
Relevance theory (Sperber and Wilson, 1986/1995) is usually identified as the principal theoretical framework in the area of cognitive pragmatics (see Relevance Theory). Nonetheless, in the last decade, other theories have been developed. These include a far-reaching theory of the cognitive processes underlying human communication, known as the Cognitive Pragmatics theory (Airenti et al., 1993a, 1993b; Bara, 2005), and the Graded Salience Hypothesis (Giora, 2003), a theory which focuses

72 Cognitive Pragmatics

on mental inferences underlying the comprehension of literal vs. figurative language (see Metaphor: Psychological Aspects; Accessibility Theory).
Describing the cognitive processes involved in communicative interaction is interesting not only for the study of such processes as fixed states – an approach that takes into consideration exclusively the final stage in healthy adult subjects – but also for the consideration of how a given function develops from infancy, through childhood, and to adulthood, and how it eventually decays in subjects with brain injuries (Bara, 1995). Such an approach makes it possible to better comprehend, from a cognitive perspective, how pragmatic competence develops and what neurocognitive structures might cause deficits in people’s performance if damaged.
A closely related topic is the identification of the cognitive components that contribute to the realization of a complete pragmatic competence. From this perspective, it is important to consider the role played by a person’s Theory of Mind and by the Executive Function (see below) during a communicative interaction.
Cognitive Pragmatics Theory
Airenti et al. (1993a, 1993b) presented a theory of the cognitive processes underlying human communication aiming to provide a unified theoretical framework for the explanation of different communicative phenomena (Bara, 2005). The authors proposed that their theoretical analysis holds for both linguistic and extralinguistic communication, and thus introduced, with reference to the interlocutors, the terms ‘actor’ and ‘partner’ instead of the classical ‘speaker’ and ‘hearer.’ The theory assumes that the literal meaning of an utterance is necessary but not sufficient to the partner in order for him or her to reconstruct the meaning conveyed by the actor, and that in order to understand the actor’s communicative intention, the partner has to recognize a ‘behavior game’ the actor is proposing for him (the partner) to play. The behavior game is a social structure mutually shared by the participants of the communicative interaction. Suppose, for example, that while you are working in your office, a colleague walks in and says: [1] It’s snowing outside. Although the literal meaning of the utterance is completely clear, you probably are utterly bewildered about how to respond. Only if [1] is understood as an invitation not to go outside, a request to close the window, a proposal to go skiing next week-end (that is, only if, in some way, the reason or reasons for uttering the expression were evident), will you be able to make the necessary inferences and answer appropriately. The utterance, pure and

simple, without a game to refer to, has in itself no communicative significance whatsoever. Thus, an utterance extrapolated from its context of reference has no communicative meaning and cannot have any communicative effect on the partner.
Starting from the assumption that the communicative meaning of an utterance is intrinsically linked to the context within which it is proffered, Bosco et al. (2004a) defined a taxonomy of six categories of context: Access, Space, Time, Discourse, Behavioral Move, and Status. Using contextual information, the partner can identify the behavior game bid by the speaker, which allows him to fully comprehend the actor communicative intention.
Following the tenets of the Cognitive Pragmatics theory, Bucciarelli et al. (2003) proposed that two cognitive factors affect comprehension of various kind of pragmatic phenomena: the ‘inferential load’ and the ‘complexity of mental representations’ underlying the comprehension of a communicative act.
Inferential Load: Simple and Complex Speech Acts
Searle (1975) claimed that in speech act comprehension, the literal interpretation of an utterance always has priority with respect to any other interpretations derived from it. According to Searle, understanding an indirect speech act, e.g., [2] Would you mind passing me the salt?, is harder than understanding a direct speech act, e.g., [3] Please pass me the salt, because it requires a longer inferential process.
Bara and Bucciarelli (1998) provided empirical evidence that, beginning at two-and-a-half years of age, children find direct speech acts such as [4] Please sit down, and conventional indirects such as [5] Would you mind closing the door? equally easy to comprehend. In a further study, Bucciarelli et al. (2003) found that starting at age two-and-a-half years, children find both direct and conventional indirect speech acts easier to understand than nonconventional indirect speech acts, such as the utterance [6] Excuse me, I’m studying when it is a request to a partner who is hammering in a nail to stop making noise.
Using the tenets of Cognitive Pragmatics theory, it is possible to abandon the distinction between direct and indirect speech acts and adopt a new one based on the difference between inferential processes involved in comprehending simple as against complex communicative acts (Bara and Bucciarelli, 1998). According to the theory, the partner’s understanding of any kind of speech act depends on the comprehension of the behavioral game bid by the actor; an agent will interpret an interlocutor’s utterance based on the grounds that are assumed to be shared. In this perspective, the partner’s difficulty in understanding a

Cognitive Pragmatics 73

communicative act depends on the inferential chain necessary to refer the utterance to the game intended by the actor. Direct and conventional indirect speech acts make immediate reference to the game, and thus are defined as ‘simple speech acts.’ On the other hand, nonconventional indirect speech acts can be referred to as ‘complex speech acts,’ because they require a chain of inferential steps due to the fact that the specific behavior game of which they are a move is not immediately identifiable. For example, to understand [4] and [5], it is sufficient for the partner to refer to the ‘Ask for Something’ game. In order to understand [6], a more complex inferential process is necessary: the partner needs to share with the actor the belief that when a person is studying, he needs silence and that since hammering is noisy [6] is a request to stop it is noisy. Only then, the partner can attribute to the utterance the value of a move in the ‘Ask for Something’ game. Thus, if the problem is how to access the game, the distinction between direct and indirect speech acts is not relevant. It is the complexity of the inferential steps necessary to refer the utterance to the game bid by the actor that accounts for the difficulties in speech act comprehension.
This distinction applies not only to standard communicative acts such as direct, conventional indirect, and nonconventional indirect speech acts, but also to nonstandard ones (such as ironic and deceitful) ones (Bara et al., 1999a). The same distinction between simple and complex standard, ironic, and deceitful communicative acts holds for extralinguistic communication acts as well (see Irony). That is, the distinction holds also when the actor communicates with the partner only through gestures (Bosco et al., 2004b) (see Gestures, Pragmatic Aspects).
The inferential load underlying a communicative act may explain the difference in difficulty that exists in the comprehension of different communicative acts pertaining to the same pragmatic category, such as between simple and complex standard communicative acts. To explain the difference in difficulty that might occur among communicative acts pertaining to a different pragmatic category, such as between a direct communicative act and a deceitful communicative act, is necessary to consider the complexity of the mental representations involved in their comprehension.
Complexity of Mental Representations
Still within the framework of Cognitive Pragmatics theory and along with the same complexity of the inferential load involved, Bucciarelli et al. (2003) described an increasing difficulty in comprehending simple communicative acts of different sorts: simple

standard, simple deceitful, and simple ironic communicative acts.
According to the theory, in standard communication, default rules of inference are used to understand another person’s mental states; default rules are always valid unless their consequences are explicitly denied. Indeed, in standard communication, what the actor says is in line with his private beliefs. Direct, conventional indirect, and nonconventional indirect speech acts are all examples of standard communication. In terms of mental representations, to comprehend a standard communicative act, the partner has to simply refer the utterance proffered by the actor to the behavior game he bids.
On the other hand, nonstandard communication such as irony and deceit involves the comprehension of communicative acts via the blocking of default rules and the occurrence of more complex inferential processes that involve conflicts between the beliefs the actor has shared with the partner and the latter’s private beliefs. In the comprehension of irony and deceit, the mental representations involved produce a difference between what the actor communicates and what he privately entertains. It follows that, along with the same complexity of the inferential load involved, standard communicative acts are easier to deal with than nonstandard pragmatic phenomena.
According to Bucciarelli et al. (2003), in the case of the comprehension of deceit, the partner has to recognize the difference between the mental states that are expressed and those the actor privately entertains. Consider for instance the following example: Mark and Ann share that the lecture they just attended was incredibly boring. Later Ann meets John and tells him that Mark and she attended a tedious lecture. In the afternoon also Mark meets John, who asks him about the lecture. Actually, Mark is annoyed with John because John did not go to the lecture and he does not want John to know that he feels he wasted the whole morning. Mark does not know that John has already met Ann, thus he answers: [7] It was really interesting! John can understand that Mark is trying to deceive him because he recognizes the difference between the mental state that Mark is expressing and the one that he truly and privately entertains.
A statement, instead, becomes ironic when, in addition to the awareness of this difference, the partner also recognizes that the mental states expressed contrast with the scenario that he shares with the actor. For example, some months later, during a chat with Mark, Ann asks: Do you remember the lecture that we attended some months ago? Mark answers: [8] It was really interesting! What makes this utterance ironic is the fact that both interlocutors share that

74 Cognitive Pragmatics

the lecture had actually been boring. Thus, the difference between irony and deceit lies not in the partner’s awareness of the difference between the mental states that the actor expressed and those that he actually entertains, but in his awareness that he does or does not share this difference with the actor.
In the case of irony, the partner has to represent not only the discrepancy between the mental states that the actor expressed and those that he privately entertains, but also that such awareness is shared with the actor. This makes an ironic communicative act more difficult to comprehend than a deceitful one.
Bucciarelli et al. (2003) showed the existence of an increase in difficulty in the comprehension of simple standard communicative acts, simple deceits, and simple ironies with an experiment carried out on children from two-and-a-half to seven years of age. The authors also pointed out that the same children show a similar predicted gradation of difficulty in understanding the same pragmatic phenomena, both when these are expressed by linguistic speech acts and when these are expressed by communicative gestures. Regardless of the communicative channel used by the actor, linguistic or extralinguistic, children find simple standard speech acts easier to comprehend than simple deceits, which are, in turn, easier to comprehend than simple ironic communicative acts.
Finally, an overall consideration of the mentioned results makes it possible to conclude that all of the theoretical predictions (both derived from the Cognitive Pragmatics theory and grounded on a person’s cognitive processes underlying the communicative comprehension) hold true for the same pragmatic phenomena whether expressed by linguistic speech acts or by gestures. These results seem to indicate that linguistic and extralinguistic communicative acts share the most relevant mental processes in each of the specific pragmatic phenomena investigated and suggest that pragmatic competence shares the same cognitive faculty – regardless of the input processed – be it linguistic or extralinguistic. It is possible to interpret such empirical evidence as being in favor of a unified theoretical framework of human communication in which linguistic and extralinguistic communication develop in parallel being different aspects of a unique communicative competence (see Bara and Tirassa, 1999; Bara, 2005) (see Communicative Principle and Communication).
Cognitive Pragmatics and Development
In this section, we shall examine the empirical evidence in favor of the existence of cognitive processes of increasing complexity that underlie different pragmatic phenomena. The developmental domain is particularly interesting for this aim because it makes it

possible to observe errors in the comprehension of different kinds of pragmatics tasks that allow us to falsify our hypotheses regarding the complexity of the mental processes involved in specific phenomena. However, adult subjects possess a fully developed cognitive system and communicative competence, and thus they do not show any interesting errors in comprehending or producing different kinds of communicative acts; it is only possible to analyze their time of reaction in solving such tasks.
On the other hand, if inferential processes and mental representations of increasing complexity underlie the comprehension of various kind of pragmatic phenomena, then it is possible to explain why, during the development of children’s communicative competence, some communicative acts are understood and produced before others are. For example, children initially only understand sincere communicative acts and only later on in their development do they start comprehending, for example, deceit and irony. Children’s ability to deal with mental representations and inferential chains of increasing complexity develops with age, and this fact helps explain the development of their pragmatic competence.
From this perspective, the increasing capacity to construct and manipulate complex mental representations is involved in the emergence of preschoolers’ and kindergarten student’s capacity to deceive. A deceptive task could be made easier to comprehend by reducing the number of characters, episodes, and scenes involved in the task, and by including a deceptive context (Sullivan et al., 1994).
Likewise the ability to comprehend and produce different forms of ironies involves an increasing and sophisticated inferential ability. Lucariello and Mindolovich (1995) carried out a study on the ability of 6- and 8-year-old children to provide ironic endings to unfinished stories. The authors claimed that the recognition and the construction of (situational) ironic events involve the ability to manipulate the representations of events. These representations have to be critically viewed, and disassembled in order to create new, different, and ironic event structures. Also, different forms of irony behave in different ways, as the authors’ experiments show. Their results show that older children construct more complex ironic derivations from the representational base than younger children do.
Just as it is possible to better understand the development of pragmatic competence by considering the cognitive processes involved in a specific communicative act, it also is possible to explain deficits in performance in cases of brain damage. The ability of children with closed head injury to solve pragmatic tasks is specifically impaired (for a review, see Bara et al., 1999b). These subjects performed worse than

Cognitive Pragmatics 75

did their normal peers in specific pragmatic tasks such as bridging the inferential gap between events in stereotypical social situations and tasks such as comprehending utterances that require inferential processes because of their use of idiomatic and figurative language (Dennis and Barnes, 1990).
Cognitive Pragmatics and Brain Damage
Neuropsychological diseases affect communicative performance in various ways, depending on which relevant cognitive subsystem is damaged. The information obtained by studying these abnormal processes provides us with an opportunity to better understand the architecture of the brain/mind and its relationship to pragmatic competence (Tirassa, 1999; Bara and Tirassa, 2000). Acquired brain damage impairs certain cognitive processes while leaving others unaffected. For example, it is well-documented in the literature that aphasic patients with left-brain damage have residual pragmatic competence despite their language impairment.
On the other hand, what different cerebral injuries have in common is a damaged capacity to deal with phenomena that require complex mental processes in order to be understood. In particular, if the tasks require more complex inferences, then this capacity seems to be more damaged than in other cases, as we will show later in this section. Results like these seem to confirm the assumption that different pragmatic phenomena require the activation of increasingly complex cognitive processes.
McDonald and Pearce (1996) found that traumatic brain injured patients (TBI) do not have difficulty in the comprehension of written sincere exchanges such as [9] Mark: What a great football game!; Wayne: So you are glad I asked you?, but they have several problems, compared to the normal control subjects, in comprehending ironic exchanges such as [10] Mark: What a great football game!; Wayne: Sorry I made you come. The authors gave the subjects the same experimental material in auditory form and found that the patients’ performance did not improve. The authors concluded that TBI patients have difficulty in comprehending irony and that, even if the tone of voice usually facilitates the comprehension of ironic remarks, it is not sufficient on its own.
Furthermore, McDonald (1999) found that, surprisingly, TBI patients have no problem understanding written ironic utterances such as [11] Tom: That’s a big dog; Monica: Yes, it’s a miniature poodle. The author suggested that [11] might require a shorter inferential chain compared to [10] in order to be understood. Indeed, in comprehending [11], it is sufficient to understand what Monica answers as meaning that Tom’s statement meant the opposite of what

it said. In [10], however, Wayne’s response is not only a rejection of the original comment, but an allusion to Mark’s actual reaction to the game. Thus, there were at least two necessary inferential steps in the comprehension process. Such findings are in line with the proposal that different kinds of irony may vary in their difficulty of being understood, according to the complexity of the required inferential load (Bara et al., 1999a).
Particularly interesting from our perspective are studies that showed that the decay of pragmatic competence in closed head injured subjects (CHI) reflects the same type of development that is observed in normal children, i.e., the capacities acquired later in the development of the pragmatic ability are the most damaged. Using a linguistic experimental protocol, Bara et al. (1997) tested a group of CHI subjects and found that specific pragmatic tasks such as the comprehension of nonstandard communication, e.g., deceit and irony, are more difficult than tasks requiring only simple mental representations, such as the comprehension of standard communication involving only direct, conventional, and nonconventional indirect speech acts. In addition, the authors found no differences in patients’ comprehension of direct and conventional indirect speech acts. The same results were observed in the performance of children aged 2 to 6 years old who were tested by the same experimental protocol (Bara and Bucciarelli, 1998). It should also be noted that Bara et al. (1997) presented two classical tests on false belief to CHI patients in order to measure their theory of mind, but did not find any significant difference with the control group of children who were not brain damaged. Thus, the patients’ poor performance on pragmatic tasks cannot be ascribed to a deficit of the Theory of Mind; that is, their poor performance cannot be ascribed to an inability to understand another person’s mental states.
Moreover, Bara et al. (2000) used a similar extralinguistic version of the same pragmatic experimental protocol and evaluated the comprehension of standard communication, i.e., simple and complex communicative acts, and nonstandard communication, i.e., deceit and irony. Such a protocol contains videotaped scenes wherein the pragmatic phenomena are presented using extralinguistic means, such as pointing or clapping. The subjects were firstly a group of children 2–6 years of age and secondly a group of Alzheimer’s disease patients, and found that children show the same tendency in the development of extralinguistc competence that was observed by Bara and Bucciarelli (1998) in the linguistic domain. In addition, the authors observed a similar tendency toward decay in the Alzheimer’s patients’ extralinguistic competence: the nonstandard extralinguistic tasks

76 Cognitive Pragmatics

are understood less well than are the standard communicative tasks. Finally, the trend of decaying pragmatic competence in the Alzheimer patient group matched the results obtained by CHI patients, when tested according to the same extralinguistic protocol (Bara et al., 2001). The CHI subjects were also given several neuropsychological tests, but no statistical correlation between the subjects’ performance on the pragmatic protocol and their performance on these collateral neuropsychological tests was found. Thus, the patient’s poor performance cannot be ascribed to a deficit in their executive functioning.
As already observed for the development of pragmatic linguistic and extralinguistic competence, the empirical data concerning brain damaged subjects seem to be in favor of the existence of a unified pragmatic competence which is independent of the input – whether it is linguistic or extralinguistic. That is, the comprehension of speech acts and extralinguistic communicative acts shares the most relevant mental processes when tested on different pragmatic phenomena, and the pragmatic competence seems to be independent of the expressive means used to realize it.
Cognitive Pragmatics and the Executive Function
While the literature provides empirical evidence that mental processes involved in various pragmatic tasks can be ordered according to increasing difficulty, as we have seen above, in order fully comprehend pragmatic competence from a cognitive perspective, we need to consider also a further factor affecting the human ability to communicate: the executive functions.
The Executive Function is a cognitive construct used to describe the goal-directed behaviors that are mediated by the frontal lobes. The Executive Function guides a person’s actions and enables him to behave adaptively and flexibly; it includes cognitive capacities such as planning, inhibition of dominant responses, flexibility, and working memory.
Barnes and Dennis (2001) have shown that, in addition to a deficient inferential ability, also a reduction of working memory and metacognitive skills may be invoked to explain closed-head injured children’s problems in comprehending stories. Working memory provides the necessary resources for computing inference in ongoing text comprehension; metacognitive skills are used when checking if, and when, an inference needs to be made. The authors tested children with severe to mild head injury on their ability to comprehend brief written stories, and found inferencing deficits in children with severe (but not with mild)

head injury; these children had problems linking their general knowledge to the particular wording of the text. In general, when the metacognitive demands and the pressure on working memory were reduced, children with severe head injuries did not show any deficiencies in inferencing compared to the development in normal children or their mildly head-injured peers. Working memory also plays a role in explaining the poor ability to comprehend written stories that is observed in children with hydrocephalus, a neurodevelopmental disorder accompanied by increased pressure of the cerebrospinal fluid on the brain tissue. Children with hydrocephalus, when compared to the control group, show increasing difficulty drawing on information from an earlier read sentence when trying to understand a new sentence, the greater the distance between the two texts. Thus, while these children do not seem to have a fundamental problem in making inferences, their poor performance is mainly due to a deficit in their working memory (Barnes et al., 2004).
As to the role of other executive functions, Channon and Watts (2003) examined the ability of CHI patients to comprehend brief vignettes involving pragmatic judgement and the relationship between this activity and some executive functions: working memory, inhibition, and the ability to organize and plan appropriate responses in a certain context. The authors found that only the ability to solve the inhibition task, which required the subjects to inhibit dominant words and generate words that completed sentences with nonsensical endings, correlates with the pragmatic comprehension task. No association was found with the other executive skills.
From a neuropsychological perspective, intact frontal lobes are critical to executive functioning, and because traumatic brain injury often results in damage to these areas, pragmatic deficits shown by these patients can be explained by a principal Executive Function impairment. From this perspective, the deficits in planning and monitoring of behavior that are usually observed in such patients seem to explain the difficulty these subjects have in adhering to the structure of conventional discourse (McDonald and Pearce, 1998).
To conclude, theoretical and empirical studies in the literature seem to suggest that in order to explain people’s pragmatic competence, it is necessary to take into account the role played by at least three elements: mental processes, namely, the inferential load and the complexity of the mental representations; the Theory of Mind; and the Executive Function. Whereas the empirical studies mainly focus on the linguistic competence that is needed to realize various pragmatic tasks, the perspective should be widened to include

Cognitive Pragmatics 77

a methodical comparison with extralinguistic competence. In order to establish whether, or not, the cognitive components that make these two different means of communication are the same in both cases. Finally, a complete theory in the cognitive pragmatic domain should be able to explain not only adult normal subjects’ ability to communicate, but also the development and the decay of this capacity in brain-damaged patients.

Cognitive Technology (CT) as a Scholarly Discipline
The primary area of inquiry is Technological Cognition (TC), which examines what happens to humans when they augment themselves with technologies, either physically or cognitively, to amplify their natural capabilities. The aim of CT/TC is to formulate and to test theories of human cognitive processes that interact with technological artifacts and are partially formed by those interactions. As a fluid, symbiotic hybrid of the embodied mind and its tools, such a technologized cognition has epistemic effects: It affords an understanding and control of the external world that otherwise would not have been possible. As rational agents, humans develop and use tools to empower themselves in the real world which exists independently of them. This places CT/TC firmly in the realist tradition, in direct contrast with the assumptions of postmodernism: if the external world were merely a social construct, where reality is reduced to, and interpreted as, text, tool augmentation other than that related to natural language (e.g., metaphor) would be superfluous and CT/TC would lose its raison d’eˆtre. The belief that the human mind is molded by tools and open to scientific scrutiny also dissociates CT/TC from any theoretical framework that is essentially behaviorist in nature.
Methodology for Tool Design
Dialectic adaptation of the mind to the operations of its tools – a process that is often tool-coerced – leads to technological change. Increased technological sophistication forces us to make ethical choices. Of interest here is a search for design methods and practice capable of eliminating, before they even arise, any undesirable effects of tool use on users. The main question is ‘‘Which design methods and practice will result in tool-mind-world hybrids that optimally benefit humankind?’’ CT, understood as a methodology for design, is thus a process: an approach to design, not a product of such a design. We can design tools in accordance with CT principles, informed by the theoretical developments of TC, but those tools are not in themselves instances of CT.
The search for ethical factors in tool design means that studies undertaken within CT are primarily about people and not about the technologies that augment them. This distinguishes CT

from investigations of the so-called human factors in designing human-centered systems that promote ‘naturalness’ in human-tool exchanges and aim at designing ergonomic, user-friendly tools, in order to fully accommodate the limits of human performance and fully exploit the advantages of the user (as it is practiced in areas such as Cognitive Ergonomics, Cognitive Engineering, and Engineering Psychology). What such practices do not overtly address is the question of who really stands to benefit. Nor do they explicitly consider that every tool is a prosthetic device (some mental functions become redundant), that the user/tool relation is of one-to-many (with the dangers of stress overload), that sophisticated tools can obscure dignity at work, that they separate people from their natural habitat or change their perception of their own competence. By contrast, CT aims to bring humane factors to bear on design. The tool-mind-world hybrids designed according to the principles of CT are intended to be essentially anthropocentric, i.e., they maximize human (user) benefits (see Figure 1).
Mind-Amplifying Tool
CT takes a broad view of technology. All artifacts are in some measure cognitive tools. We need to understand them in terms of their goals and computational constraints as well as in terms of the external physical and social environments that shape and afford cognition. Any technology that serves that purpose by providing a tool has implications for CT/TC.
Cognitive tools can be situated on a continuum of purposeful use between the extremes of raw material and the brain. They can be more or less externalized or detached from the brain or the body (cf. bionic prostheses incorporating direct brain implants with word processors vs. spades). The greater the detachment, the lower the brain-tool connectivity and alignment. The lower the connectivity, the lower the ability to attend to the feedback the brain receives at
Figure 1 Anthropocentric CT design versus traditional humancentered design.

Cognitive Technology 79

the interface; consequently, the less the need for people to adapt to the tool. Within this continuum, we can distinguish between natural technologies and fabricated technologies.
Natural Technologies
Natural technologies are instances of mental techne´, i.e., learned skills and mental competencies. Examples proposed within CT include a body image generator responsible for perceiving one’s own body size, the cognitive processes within the prefrontal cortex responsible for our social competence, or the cognitive processes evolved in autism. Here also belong learned aspects of natural language (see Whorf, Benjamin Lee), narratives, mnemonic systems for improving memory, task-dedicated cognitive processes in logic and arithmetic, or metaphors in cultural heritage. The mind itself can be viewed as a complex, goal-driven toolkit of natural cognitive artifacts that bootstrap on what is hard-wired, in order to make available a much bigger set of such artifacts. The mind thus facilitates interactions with the environment through the organization and integration of perceptual data, memory, and goal-management.
Fabricated Technologies
While some fabricated technologies are tangible (pens, paper, computers, mechanical gadgets, telecommunication devices, medical equipment, or flight simulators are obvious examples), others are not, but nonetheless they affect our mental capabilities and competences: e.g., writing systems, narratives, artificial languages, and so on.
Cybernetic systems such as robots can become a scientist’s cognitive tools if they are built to further scientific progress. They have been applied to understand how categorical perception works, how intelligence of natural systems is embodied, and to the question of whether there is a fundamental distinction between humans and machines. In artificial intelligence, computation has been employed to formulate and to test theories of intelligence or the nature of consciousness. In computational linguistics, automated grammars have aided linguists in their efforts to understand the workings of natural language.
Any systematized environment that constrains cognition results in cognitive change. Perhaps the best example is a prison system where people become habituated to its inherent operations; many are unable to function effectively upon release. Or, take an organizational merger: Its most challenging aspect is consolidating the diversity of employees’ mental cultures.

Perspectives on Mind Change
The simplest form of cognitive change is learning, and many technologies are purposefully developed to this end. While people will adapt to any technology, the extent of their adaptation depends on the extent of the cognitive fit between the human mind and the augmenting technology. When some mental processes are taken over by technology, the relevant natural technologies augment, too. A subsequent absence of the tool may then render the acquired techne´ ineffective. (As an example, consider the impact of word processors on generating texts.) Such a technological augmentation is not permanent and can be unlearned.
Technological augmentation can also have lasting effects. Longitudinal studies in archaeology reveal that cognitive fluidity can be directly linked to tool use. Studies in primatology and developmental psychology show that language constructs, in particular storytelling, played a crucial role in handling the complexity of the social dynamics responsible for the evolution of the primate brain. Social and narrative intelligence requires a larger neocortex, hence a bigger brain size.
Can we predict a priori the long-term effects of a given technology on the human user? The difficulty of this question has been recognized with respect to language. The meaning of a linguistic symbol depends on how, and in which context, it is used (see Context, Communicative; Wittgenstein, Ludwig Josef Johann). Language becomes alive and unfolds its history via its interaction with people. Meanings transform across different epochs and different cultures as a result of interpreting and reinterpreting language. The context of its use, and the medium through which it is used, have a bearing on language itself. Consider the impact of the Internet and mobile phones (texting) on the art of conversation or the spelling of words. The same is true of any artifact. Internal structure of design and a form perceived at the interface are insufficient to derive the social and personal significance or the subsequent development of a piece of technology. The latter can only happen in the context in which it is used. In the absence of such context, there is no unique answer to the question ‘‘What is this artifact for?’’ Its affordances for action (the toolness of a tool) only become manifest when the mind comes in contact with it in some context.
To predict the consequences of tool use, it is necessary (though not sufficient) to understand the social, psychological, and cognitive mechanisms that create the need for technological augmentation. A theoretical framework with a potential for such investigations must necessarily deal with motives

and benefits, in other words, with relevance. Within CT, the Theory of Relevance, originally developed with respect to language use (see Relevance Theory), has been broadened to encompass all cognitive processes (symbolic and connectionist) involved in action planning and goal management. This extended framework can be invoked to explain the modularity of mind and remove a variety of difficulties experienced in the symbol-driven acquisition of natural technologies or the design of fabricated ones. It provides grounds for classifying a dedicated inferential comprehension module as an instance of natural CT. By recognizing a multitude of cognitive interfaces (e.g., between perception, consciousness, knowledge, motivation, emotion, action, natural/fabricated technologies, external situations), the extended framework can assist the exploration of (1) the extent to which the constraints on our mental life are biologically or technologically determined, and (2) how language techne´ interacts with other aspects of cognition, facilitating, ultimately, the choice between various proposals for developing a humanized linguistic technology. Even so, the big question, whether, and to what extent, technology can be humanized, remains an open question (see Adaptability in Human-Computer Interaction).

Comics, Pragmatic Aspects of
K-A L Mey, Carmel, Calif, USA ß 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.
A comic (plural: comics), also known as (a) comic strip(s), is a narrative form that combines written text (see Text and Text Analysis) and pictorial elements.

A comic consists of a series of interrelated picture/text combinations. Each single picture stands in direct relation to the preceding units; this sequential order constitutes a chain of reference. Comparable to other serial productions of mass media such as soap operas or book and film series, comics have a continuous cast of main characters. The fact that the reader is

Comics, Pragmatic Aspects of 81

familiar with the protagonists’ background serves as another important point of reference.
Comics either appear as regular strips in printed media (comic strips), in comic magazines with contributions by various authors, or as comic books featuring a main character and his or her story or episodes.
Origins of the Comics
Although the historic roots of comics can be traced back to the 18th and 19th centuries, to political cartoons and illustrated narratives such as Max und Moritz (1865) by Wilhelm Busch, comics in their modern form are a relatively recent phenomenon. At the end of the 19th century, American newspapers included comic strips in their Sunday supplement to attract more readers. These humorous picture-stories, also known as ‘the funnies’ or comic strips, gave their name to a new genre (see Genre and Genre Analysis), the comics, which is not restricted to funny stories only.
Narrative Means: How Comics Tell a Story
Is there a language specific to comics? At first sight, expressions like ‘zooom,’ ‘grrowr!’ and ‘splash!’ are likely to be identified as typical expressions of comiclanguage. While such expressions are certainly characteristic of the medium, they do not touch its essence. Among the great variety of narrative means of the comic, the most important feature is the interdependence of the illustrations and written text. Both elements are bearers of meaning, but it is their combination that makes up the narrative.
While the narrative may have any imaginable content – there are adventure stories, political satire, family series, the classical Greek mythologies and the Bible retold, comics for children, so-called adult comics with erotic or pornographic components, etc. – what all comics have in common is the use of this specific means of telling a story.
A comic consists of minimally two picture–text units, called panels. Panels are usually square boxes containing an image and sometimes text, bounded by a thin frame line. These panels are to be read in sequential order, comparable to a normal text, and this sequential relation distinguishes a comic from a mere accumulation of pictures. This sequence distinguishes a comic from a cartoon, which consists of a single picture-frame only.
If a comic is to be read like a text, the author has to create coherence within the story. He achieves this by forming a ‘chain of reference.’ This chain of reference will enable the reader to recognize the different panels

as narrative elements of the same story, comparable to the process of reading a text – the reader knows that the preceding words of a sentence are connected to the following words and will create a coherent narrative (see Pragmatics of Reading).
To illustrate this, let’s imagine an episode with the world’s most famous duck, Walt Disney’s Donald Duck. A first panel might show Donald Duck sitting on a bench; the second one, Donald walking through a park; the last one, Donald in front of a house.
Theoretically, the reader could interpret this pictures as three separate pictures: ‘Donald sits on a bench’ / ‘Donald takes a stroll in the park’ / ‘Donald stands in front of his/a house.’
But the reader knows, by means of identical reference, that every Donald appearing in the panels following the first panel is the same protagonist in the same story. That way, the reader can fill in the narrative gaps and verbalize this sequence of panels as ‘Donald sat on a bench and walked home through a park.’ As most readers will be familiar with the small suburban house that Donald lives in, the author can draw on this familiarity with Donald’s surroundings as a further point of reference.
This system of reference is based on two narrative strings. One string refers to the space or environment where the action occurs, the other refers to the action itself.
In this way, once introduced, the environment ‘park’ remains valid until a new environment appears. The depiction of the park can be reduced to a single tree, a meadow, a flower – it may even disappear entirely, with no harm done to text comprehensibility, as the reader will still know the setting to be a park.
The other string deals with the action. Here, too, an element, mostly a living being such as Donald Duck in the example above, refers to its first introduction and can be reduced in various ways, e.g., to a silhouette, a hand, a hat floating on the water (as will happen to such an unlucky person as Donald). The separation between these two narrative strings, environment and action, is not absolute, though; an element of the environment can become bearer of an action, for instance, when a rock gives up its function as environment and falls down to block the road instead. Conversely, Donald’s car can change function: when he parks it in front of his house and walks away, the car becomes part of the environment and is no longer an element of the action string.
In comics, a story can do without a description of the environment, but not without action. However, even though the description of action thus has priority over that of the environment, the latter has another, equally important function: it determines the rhythm of the narrative. An environment drawn in
