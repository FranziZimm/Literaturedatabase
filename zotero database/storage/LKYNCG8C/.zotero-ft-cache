INTRODUCTION.
These texts result from a visit to the Chipewyan of Cold Lake Reserve, Alberta, Canada, from June 28 to July 15, 1911. This visit was made with the desire of obtaining at first hand some definite knowledge of the sounds and structure of a northern or Dene dialect of an Athapascan language for the purpose of comparison with Pacific Coast and southern dialects.
The band which numbers 273 is attached to Onion Lake Agency. They are the southernmost Chipewyan and therefore are closely associated with the Cree. Their manner of life is still much that which has prevailed in the Mackenzie Valley for a century. The winters are spent in hunting and trapping, for which purpose, long journeys are taken into the wilderness to the north, dogs and sledges being used for transportation, and tents for shelter. The food required is obtained from the fur-bearing animals trapped, and an occasional moose. A narrative of such a trip was obtained and is presented in text 15. The summers are spent about the lakes where fish and water fowl are plentiful. Travel is by birchbark canoes and may be continued many miles to the north and east with but short and occasional portages. Recently, grain has been sown, gardens raised, and a few milch cows kept.
The only primitive arts remaining relate to the building of canoes, and the making of snowshoes and moccasins. The moccasins are in one piece of moose skin colored by the spruce smoke with which the hide is cured and have decorations at the instep worked in silk.
The entire band are faithful Catholics. The church literature and ministrations are in the Chipewyan dialect. Father Le Goff I has been their missionary for forty years and knows their language thoroughly. No instance of the old religious practices or beliefs was observed. The older people remember an annual spring ceremony called, " feeding the fire" during which many small pieces of animal food were placed in the fire. Part of an old ceremony was unwittingly obtained in text 8. This was used in fishing, the story being related in accompanying songs. Inquiry resulted in securing one other fragmentary text (9), and accounts of other ceremonies relating to fishing and hunting. Mention was also made of the former use of a tall sweat lodge in which songs were sung and other ceremonial acts occurred.

The texts are myths and tales apparently typical of the Chipewyan and other D&n6. Most of them have parallels among those of PetitotI and those obtained by Dr. Lowie which will appear as a number of this volume. Unless otherwise indicated by footnotes, they were obtained from Jean Baptiste Ennou, a man of about thirty-five years of age who speaks good English although his schooling was confined to a few terms in a school formerly maintained on the Reserve. The texts are reproduced as first recorded with the exception of a few evident errors of writing. The inaccuracies and errors due to hearing have been intentionally retained since such errors often point to the character of the sounds misunderstood. The second part of this volume will furnish an analysis of the material here presented with many illustrative tracings. All comments on phonetics and structure are reserved for that paper.

1. THE MONSTER BIRD.'
In the beginning, two young men secured some geese and tied them to their canoe so that they might be drawn through the water by them. The young men lay down in the canoe, saying to the geese, "Take us wherever your land may be." When they stood up, they found the geese full grown. As they were without food, they killed them, built a fire, and cooked and ate them, and when they had finished their meal, continued their journey.
After they had gone a long distance, they again found themselves without food. Some wolves came to them and fed them with fat and pemmican. " Do not eat it all," the wolves admonished them, "leave some to eat in the morning after you have slept." The wolves also gave them arrows but cautioned them as to their use and said, " If you should shoot grouse, after a time, and the arrow sticks a short way up in a tree, do not climb up to get it." The young men resumed their journey. After a time, one of them shot grouse and his arrow fell rather high on a tree. Not heeding the warning of the wolves, he said to his companion, "I am going to get it." "No," said the other, "the wolves told us not to do that." Thinking the arrow was not very high, he stood on something and reached toward it. The arrow moved still further out of his reach and the young man involuntarily ascended toward the sky after it.
The one who had ascended to the sky traveled alone until he came where a tipi stood. He found an old woman there who blackened his face with a coal. He heard two girls laughing in the brush behind the house. When they came in, they said, " Mother, what sort of a bad animal has come here? " They laughed at him a long time, and then went out again into the brush. The old woman immediately washed his face and combed his hair. Soon lhe heard the girls talking again, saying, "We will go in again and laugh at that thing which came." As soon as they came in each said, "I would like to have that man. I will marry him." That night, one lay down on either side of him. After a time, when the man woke up, he found he was under the ground and could not move. In the morning, he heard the family going away. He heard the two girls laughing as they started; but
Petitot, Emile (Traditions Indiennes du Canada Nord-Ouest, Paris, 1886) secured a version of this myth from a native of Great Slave Lake (pp. 352-362) which differs in the beginning in telling of the father of the two young men who sent them out to hunt and in the omission at the end of the capture of the young man and his second imprisonment in the nest. He also includes a myth recorded by Faraud in 1859 of very different import in which the same characters, both human and supernatural appear (pp. 362-372).
Dr. Lowie's version obtained at Fort Chipewyan is exactly parallel except that giants flrst befriended them instead of wolves and that the burning of the nest is omitted.

the old woman was crying, and saying to herself, " They have done that way to many nice men who have come to me." Not long after that he heard some wolves coming to the campsite. "What has happened? " one of them said, " There is the smell of a live man." One of the wolves, named EbedahoLtihe, was addressed, "There is a man under the ground. We will take him out. Go and get the partly chewed bone we left behind the old camp." The man heard someone tapping with a spear on the ground as he ran along. Sooft he heard the same sounds as the wolf returned. They tried to dig with the rib which he had brought, but it broke. "Get something else," he heard him say. He went again and brought the leg bone of a moose which has the two side bones and dew claws. That did not break and with it they soon dug the man out. Then he found it was the wolves who had done all this.
The wolves then gave him two arrows and directions for their use. "This arrow is female," one of them said, "and this one is male. If when you hunt, a cow moose runs away into the brush, you must shoot this female arrow toward the place. But if a bull moose runs into the brush, shoot in that direction with the male arrow. When you have killed a moose, take the intestines and tie them back and forth on a tree. Then you must tell one of the girls that you have left a rope with which she shall carry the moose. If her rope breaks and she begins to curse we will attend to her should we hear her saying, 'mean wolf."'
Then the man went on, following the tracks of the women. When he came close to them, he began to hunt. Seeing where a cow moose had run into the brush, he shot the female arrow. Where a bull moose had run in, he shot the male arrow. He found that each of his arrows had killed a moose. He then went where the people had camped and said to the two girls, "Go and get the moose I have killed." To one of the girls whose name was Weasel-vermin he said, " You need not take a rope with you, for I have left one for you." He told the other girl called Mice-vermin, to take a rope. The girls started for the moose, the man following along with them. When they came near the place where the moose were lying, he said to Weasel-vermin, "You get the one that is over there." He found that each of the girls was accustomed to carry an entire moose on her back at one time. Weasel-vermin found that he meant the intestines when he told her that he left a rope hanging in the tree for her. When she attempted to carry the moose whole with it, the rope began to break. She began to curse and finally said, "mean wolf." Immediately, he heard her running in a circle and shouting. When he came to the place, he found only some human hair lying there, and the marks on the snow where the body had been dragged away. He ran immediately to the other girl and pulled her

clothes off. Mice ran under the snow. He found that she was a mouse and the other girl a weasel. After that, she became a person and married the man. The man lived there with his mother-in-law.
He remained there for considerable time. He killed many moose but did not know what became of the skins of the moose which he killed. His mother-in-law had dressed just one of them. After a time, she said to him, "Your relatives are lonesome and I do not like that. There is a hole through the sky here ahead of us. Let us go there." When they came to the place, she wrapped the man in the one moose hide she had dressed. He found that she had made rope of the other hides. With the rope she lowered the man. "When you feel yourself touching the ground,?' she told him, "you must untie the rope and pull it several times." After a time, he thought he felt the ground under him. He crawled out of the hide, pulled the rope repeatedly, and it disappeared toward the sky. When he looked about he was astonished to find that he was not yet on the ground but on the nest of the flying things which feed upon people. Human bones were lying about. A young one of the birds was sitting there. He took a liking to the man and said to him, "I usually eat people but you shall live. Sit here under my wings." The bird was so large that a person could hide underit. Soon it spoke to him again, saying, "After a while, it will be dark as if it were night. It will be my mother coming. When it becomes light again, my father will come." After a short time it grew dark, and the mother bird lit there. She said to the young one, " I smell a human odor coming from you." "Oh, its the human remains lying there which you brought," the young one told its mother. "No, it is not. It is the odor of a living person, which I smell coming from you," the mother replied. When she had found the man, the young one said, " You shall not do anything to him, he will live. If you kill him you must kill me too."
After a time it became light again and the father bird arrived. He said the same things to the young one and received the same replies. On account of that the man was allowed to live. When they had both gone off again, the young one said to the man, " I am going to put my wings on you. You shall fly across." The man found that the nest was on an island and that there were rapids on either side in the large stream flowing there. The bird put the wings on the man saying to him, "Fly around here until you are sure you can fly across." The man flew about the nest a little way until he felt certain he could fly across the stream. "Do not put my wings right on the ground, lean them against a tree," the young bird told him. "On your way home, do not travel at night. Even if you think you have not far to go, lie down wherever night overtakes you." 1
1 As Dr. Lowie has pointed out (Journal of AmeriCan Folk-Lore, vol. 21, 1908, p. 120) this Incident closely agrees in detail with a Navajo myth (Matthews, Washington " Navaho Legends " 1897, pp. 119-121).

Then the man flew across from the nest, took off the wings, and leaned them against a tree. From there he started toward the place where his relatives used to live. He came where a beaver had his house and commenced to dig it out. After a time, it became dark without his knowing it. "The house is not far away. I will not sleep here since it is so close by," he said to himself and started on although it was dark. As he walked along, he carried his spear with which he had been chiseling for the beaver. Suddenly, he felt himself being taken up into the air without visible cause. He found that HoteLbale, the bird monster, had taken him away. When he had been carried a long distance, above a high rock he was thrown down upon it. Catching the top of the rock with the spear, he jumped over it and saved himself. Again, he was caught and carried away. When he was thrown again upon a sharp rock, he placed the end of his spear against it and jumped over it. He found that this rock was covered on both sides with dried human blood where the people had been killed. He was carried, still alive, to the young bird. When the young one saw him it said, "This is my grandchild, that I love. This is the one I said you must not kill. If you kill it, you must kill me too." For that reason he was not killed. "You shall remain here," the. young one said to him, and he lived there with him.
When he had been there some little time, he began to think how he might kill them. They slept only in the daytime. He placed a quantity of hay and small brush on the tree under the nest. When there was much of it there, the old one said, "Grandson, why are you doing that?" "Oh, I am playing with it," he replied. After some time he spoke to the old bird, "Grandfather, let me have your firedrill. I want to play with it." He addressed HoteLbale, as grandfather. He was given the firedrill. Then when they were asleep, during the day, he set the brush and hay on fire and burned the nest with them in it. They lay with their wings all burned. Taking a club he struck the old birds on the crowns of their heads and killed them, but he let the young one live, rubbing the burned portions of its wings away. He said to it, " If you had been the only one, I would not have done it; but your parents have killed many of my relatives."
After that, there were no such monsters but the young one was still alive. Someone has recently heard from the west that it has grown again.
A man who has knowledge of something magical does not get killed.

2. RAISED-BY-HIS-GRANDMOTHER.'
An old woman heard a little child crying. After she had looked for hime some time she discovered him sitting under a caribou chip. As he was a very little child she put him in her mitten, carried him home, and undertook to raise him. Whenever caribou were killed, and his grandmother went out after meat, the boy asked her to bring him the feet of the young caribou. One time when she went out after meat, the boy sat and waited for her return. When he saw her coming, he began calling to her, " Grandmother, the feet, the feet." "Grandson," his grandmother said, "the feet are not for you. You are not the only child. 'He is always asking for young caribou feet. This time he shall not have them,' they said about you." "Let them all freeze, let them freeze," he said. "What will your uncles do, if you say that?" his grandmother asked. "'May they find the last poor bear, the last poor bear,' you may say," he said. Then he told his grandmother when they moved camp, "Do not take me along." "What will we do? We shall die for want of meat," she said. "No, we will not die," the boy replied.
When the people had all moved away, the boy went back to the campsites and pulled away the partly burned sticks from the fireplaces. After a while, he came to the deserted camp of his uncles where he found the partly burned feet and hoofs of the caribou. "It looks like partly burned hoofs right here," the boy said to his grandmother. "Grandmother, carry me over in that direction." She took him on her back and carried him. When she had gone a long distance she put him down to rest. "Grandmother, sit there and fish in that small slough." "There are not any fish there, grandson," she replied. "Yes, there are," he said. The old woman then cut a hole through the ice and let down a hook into the water of the small slough. She immediately pulled out a large trout. "Put the hook in again," the boy said. When she put the hook down again, she pulled out a jackfish. "That is enough," the boy said. "We will camp not far from
l Dr. Lowie secured the tale here given in much the same form at Lake Athabaska. Petitot (pp. 385-398) gives four versions two of which he secured at Great Slave Lake, one from a Chipewyan, and one from a Yellow Knife in 1863. The third version was secured at Lake Athabaska in 1859 and the fourth one from a Caribou Eater of Hudson Bay and Churchhill River.
In these versions from Petitot, Raised-by-his-grandmother is a person of great power who comes to relieve the natives to whom the caribou migrations have ceased. He restores the caribou on the condition of being given the tips of their tongues as tribute and when the tribute fails, he leaves them. He is ever after invoked as the deity in charge of caribou. According to one version, he joins the musk ox and to another the bear. Evidently then, this myth is related to a caribou hunting ceremony which, judging from their almost complete reliance on that animal for food, was probably the most important of their ceremonies.

here." She made a shelter of spruce boughs in which they lived for some
time.
"Make snowshoes for me," the boy said one day to his grandmother. She made him small round snowshoes. Then he asked her to make him
some arrows. When she made them he wanted her to dress him. As soon
as she had done so, he said, " Put on my snowshoes. I am going outside a little way to play." When he had been gone some time his grandmother
went out to look for him. She followed his tracks for some distance and
then came where his snowshoes, his arrows, and his poor little clothes were lying. From that place there was only a line of caribou tracks. His grandmother turned back, crying, and saying to herself, "My little grandson has left me and become a caribou." When she got back to her camp, she sat far into the night waiting for him and crying. She heard something outside and later heard a noise again. "What can it be," she thought. It was Raised-by-his-grandmother who came into the house and said, "Take off my belt." As his grandmother loosened it, many caribou tongues fell out. "We will go after them to-morrow," he said. "Where I went, there were many caribou."
The next day, as his grandmother was carrying him along, the boy pointed the way saying, " It is over there." When they came to the top of a hill near a large lake she saw something lying on the ice. " There they are," the boy said. As they were walking along together on the lake, he said, "That young caribou, the farthest one that lies dead over there, laughed too much at me. Roast its head for me." She saw that he had killed many caribou. While he was playing with them, he bit their tongues and killed them all. They camped there by the shore of the lake, where the old woman dressed the caribou and brought them into the camp. "I am going to play with the head you roasted for me, grandmother," the boy said. He took it out-of-doors to play with, and the magpies ate it up.
After a while, without his grandmother's knowledge, the boy went to the place where those who had left them had camped. He found where they had scraped the snow from the ice to fish. All the people had frozen except his uncles who had found a bear. The uncles found the tracks of a young caribou on the ice and the spruce with which he had cleared it of snow. "Perhaps it was not just a caribou that did it," the uncles said to each other. "May be it was the small child we left behind which mother was carrying." They followed the tracks of the caribou until they came to a big lake. There they found where he had walked along with small round snowshoes. These tracks led them to the place where Raised-byhis-grandmother was living with her. They had much meat there.

3. THE DISCOVERY OF METAL BY A CAPTIVE WOMAN.'
Once a woman was stolen by the Eskimo. After she had lived with them for some time and had a child, she went away, taking it with her. She went a long distance killing birds and rabbits for food. The child was very greedy often eating everything up away from its mother. After a time they came to a large lake where she sat and cried. While she was sitting there she saw a wolf walking through the water. She wondered how he was able to cross the lake. He came up to her and licked the tears from her eyes. She soon got up and broke off two sticks. "I want to see how deep the water is," she said to herself. She waded far out into the lake but the water was only a little below her knees. Finally, she could not see the land behind her. It grew dark but she continued to wade until morning. Toward evening of the next day, there was something behind that looked like land. "The Eskimo must be following me," she thought. Ahead of her there also seemed to be land. When she came close to the shore, whatever it was behind her was also approaching. She walked very fast; the water was always at the same depth. When she came to the land, she found that it was a vast herd of caribou that was following her. She had only an awl with her but tying it to a stick she sat with it by the trail. As they came by her, she speared them. There were so many of them that they looked like land. They continued passing her until the trail was worn down so deep that only their horns stuck up. When she had killed a large number, she began drying the meat so that she could carry it with her. "I am going to leave that greedy boy behind," she said to herself.
"I will make some soup for him, in a paunch." " My son, wait here for me, I am going to carry the meat to the top of
the hill," she said to him. She started away without him. When she came to the top of the first hill she looked back and saw that he was still sitting there, eating. She went on to the top of another hill and from there she could still see him eating. The woman walked along alone. When it was night she saw a fire toward which she continued walking. She walked on for many days and nights. Every night she could see the fire. When she came to it, she found it was metal. She gathered up the best pieces and
1 This myth is briefly given by Samuel Hearne (A Journey from Prince of Wales' Fort in Hudson's Bay to the Northern Ocean, London, 1795.), pp. 175, 176, in reference to the copper mines near Coppermine River which he visited in 1771.
Petitot secured this myth at Cold Lake in 1881 with the interesting additional incident of the woman gradually sinking into the mountain, pp. 417-422. This conclusion of the story was also given by the informant from whom text 13 was secured. He added that the shallow place crossed by the woman was caused by the body of a giant who fell there in a
combat.

placed them in her blanket and carried them with her. As she went back
she piled stones on top of each other on the tops of all the hills, so that she would know the way if she wished to return. Finally, she came to some kind of people whom she did not know. When they saw that she had metal they asked her where she got it. " Very far away, in that direction, there is one hill of nothing else. It was there that I found it." "Take us to it," they said to her. She went with these people who are believed to have been Frenchmen.' Ever after, they knew about metal and were the only people who possessed it. The stones which she placed one above the other were always to be seen after that. They say the stones have now grown to be very large.

4. A MAN-EATING MONSTER.
A man was walking alone one time when something happened to him. Although he could not see anything when he looked about, he took his knife and began slashing the air as he turned from side to side. He found himself tied up worse than before and that he had been caught in sunbeams which someone had set for a snare. After a time he heard someone coming along, saying to himself, "I think I feel something." Before the person came to him, the man hit himself and covered himself with his own blood. The giant came to him and thinking him dead put him in a sack. It was the giant, Holdile, who eats men. He started away carrying the man on his back. He put him down occasionally to rest. The man tried to make no noise but sniffled in spite of himself. "I heard something," the giant said and took the load off. Then he tickled the man all over on his hands, feet, arid body. The man was unusually powerful and was able to refrain from laughing. He put him back in the sack and carried him to his home. He hung the sack on a tree and went away to the top of a hill to cut some sticks with which to make spits for roasting the kidneys.
-When he had gone away, the man began to swing himself gently in the sack, until he fell down. The young ones called out, " Father, your caribou is alive." The man jumped up, put ashes in the children's mouths and ran away. The giant ran after him. They came to an island that lay in the midst of the muskeg. They ran around it until he was tired. The giant shouted to the man. "My son, make.a fire for me, I am cold." He had been sweating and his clothes were wet. They stood by the fire drying themselves. The giant hung his cape up to dry and lay down with his back to the fire. Soon the man broke a piece of wood. "What did you do that
" Any European except an Englishman.

for?" asked the giant. "I am going to fix the fire with it," the man said. Then he told him, "Grandfather, your cape fell into the fire." The man had pushed it in with the stick. He struck the giant and killed him with the same stick that he had used to push the cape into the fire. After a time, he came to life again. The man ran away but the giant ran after him. The giant is still hunting men.

5. CROW-HEAD.
Crow-head was living with his grandmother. While he was away looking at his nets, some girls came to visit her. They laughed at his blanket, made of crow skin with the bills of the crows joined together all about its border, which was hanging in the house. When Crow-head came back from his nets, he said to his grandmother, "Who has been laughing at my blanket?" "No one laughed at your blanket," she said. "I see the marks of their laughing on it," he replied. "There was no one here in your absence," his grandmother said. "People were not here. But their laughing shows. Because they laughed at my blanket, may the Cree get them all!" "What shall I do then?" said his grandmother. "I will take you back north," he said. At night, he heard the people fighting with the Cree. All those who had laughed at his blanket were killed. He himself crawled under a birchbark dish. The Cree threw all the clothes into the fire. Then they threw in the birchbark dish, but it jumped out again. Again, they threw it in, and again it jumped out. Then they held it in the fire with a, stick and a squirrel ran out of the fire from it. The Cree fought with the squirrel until they thought they had killed it. Then he turned himself to a hair and went through the hearts of all the Cree and killed them. After that, he went to his grandmother whom the Cree had killed, put his head down by her, and began to cry. He was there a long time without going to sleep. Soon his grandmother was alive again and sat there hunting for the lice in his head.
Once, when he was living with the people, there was a young man of whom he was very jealous. After a while, the people all went out to their canoes, after swans. As they were paddling about, he met this young man. Crow-head himself, had no swans; only the young man had succeeded in killing them. He overturned the young man's canoe and caused him to drown. Taking the swans, he paddled back with them. When they were boiled, and were placed before Crow-head he said, " I will not eat the swans because I love only my young friend." After a long time, the others looked for the young man and found him drowned. "We will kill him," they said,

1912.1

and went back after Crow-head. When they tried to spear him, he hit the points of their spears so that they could not kill him. They fought with him a long time and tried hard to kill him but were unable to do so. Crow-head used to fight with the people and kept killing them.

6. EBEDAHOLTIHE.
Once the Chipewyan and the Cree both came to the same place to fish. It was snowing and blowing, so they could not see anything. Soon one man came where another was sitting by his line. " You are the only one who has caught any fish," he said. When the man looked back at him, he saw it was a Cree to whom he had spoken. Then he killed him with a spear and told his friends. Immediately, the Cree and the Chipweyan came together. There were many of them and they continued fighting each other until onlv two men were alive; one Chipewyan and one Cree. When these two had tried in vain to kill each other, they walked together to the lake. The Cree proposed that they should sit there and fish. "I have no hook," said the Chipewyan. The Cree took the larger muscle from his arm and the Chipewyan the small muscle. They fished with these for hook and line. After a while, the Cree went to look at the hook. " I did not kill anything," he told the Chipewyan when he returned. "You must have gone to it too soon. If I had gone, there would have been something." "Well, you go and look at it," said the Cree. When he came to the hook, he caught two trout.
After a short time, many Cree came to the lake. The Cree man then told the Chipewyan that there was one dangerous Cree named, EbedaxoLtihe. When they came up to them, one said to the Cree, " Many young men came here with you, I suppose that one sitting with you is one of your relatives." "He is a dangerous man whom I have tried in vain to kill," replied the Cree. "Do not bother him; he will make trouble for you." EbedaxoLtihe, said, "Fire is not disturbed by songs. Pile up a lot of wood for him." Then they built a big fire and began to push the Chipewyan toward it. As he began to burn, he said to himself, "I wish otters would come here." Soon otters came. When those who were trying to burn him saw the otters running toward him, they ran away. The Chipewyan foblowed by the otters ran after them. As he came near a man, he would catch up an otter and throw it at him. The otters bit them and they died. He threw two of them at his friend who caught them. When he threw one at EbedaxoLtihe, it nearly killed him. When he pushed his head up through the bloody snow, he struck him on the crown of his head. He gave one of

56

the otters to his friend. "Now, you see, I told you he was a dangerous man," said the young Cree.
After that, the Chipewyan went to live with the Cree. When a tipi had been put up, the Cree called to him, "Come here." When the Chipewyan was near he called to him to come in, and made a place for him on the oppo-site side of the fire. The Cree had two wives one sitting on either side of him. He picked up the one sitting near the door and threw her across the fire to the Chipewyan who caught her and threw her back. Then he took the wife sitting beyond the fire and threw her to him but he threw her back. He threw again the one sitting next to the door. She caught the Chipewyan about the neck and he married her. After that, he lived with the Cree.
He lived with the Cree a long time after that. He had children which were growing up. One time when he was away hunting he saw tracks of some people and followed them until he came where they were living. He found two of his sisters gathering firewood. He went with them to the village. One of his moccasins was torn and one of his sisters sewed it up for him. Taking a sack of red paint, he started home. When he came back to his tipi, his wife noticed that the moccasin had been mended. Her husband asked what she was thinking about. The wife, without replying, hung up his moccasins.
He went over there again and told the people what had happened. 'They talked it over and said they would come and kill them. The Chipewyan who was living with the Cree told them not-to come near his tipi which they would recognize since it would be of untanned skins. When he came home he told his wife that his head was aching and asked her to make a tipi for him of untanned skin and pitch it to one side in which he might lie. - She made a tipi for him and he went into it with all his family. He told his wife not to let the child go out of doors. In the night, he heard the Chipewyan coming. He went out immediately and came to his friend. "I will fight you again," he said. "This time I will not think about living. Do what you intend to, spear me here." "Put your spear down near by," he said. Several of the Chipewyan's relatives were killed but they killed all the Cree who were living there. The son of the Chipewyan had gone out and also been killed; but his wife and the remainder of his family were alive. The Chipewyan was about to kill some of his own people because of it but they gave him a young man of the same age in the place of his son who had been killed. Then he was satisfied and went with the Chipewyan and afterward
lived with them.

Once when the Chipewyan were returning from an unsuccessful war party against the Cree, they were approaching the top of a hill. His-legtrembles was far behind them. "I wonder what those two things are, sitting there ahead of us," one of them said. When they started up the hill their blankets -were blown back. His-leg-trembles came up to the party and started to climb the hill. " I want to see what they are," he said. "Do not go up there, there are some white bears living under the top of the hill," the others said to him. "I like to see something frightful," he said, "I am going to look at them." "No, do not," the others urged him. "I am going to look," he said. The string which held the blanket around his neck broke when it was blown back by the wind. He ran around the two white bears who were sitting there waiting for him, making the ashes fly until nothing could be seen. When the ashes settled, they saw the two bears lying with their heads away from each other and His-leg-trembles standing a little way from them leaning upon his little old spear. That man could run so fast that nothing could catch him. Without running very hard, he could keep along beside a young caribou.
At another time the Cree had put some willow sticks on a lake making them look like the horns of caribou. The Chipewyan -thought they were caribou and hung pieces of clothing about the lake to prevent the caribou from running out and began to hunt them. While they were going to their several positions, they came where His-leg-trembles was sitting. On a point of land nearly opposite the side, they thought they heard a noise. It sounded like shouting but they were not certain. Then a big woman came
near. "Niece, what has happened," they asked. "'The Cree have put up
sticks,' Thananye told me. Then I started from there in a straight line, running sidewise that I might go faster. Over in the middle of the lake, I saw the Cree fighting. When I was about to run into them, I stopped. I slipped and fell under the Cree. 'I will spear that mean little child,' one of them thought to himself. They were holding their spears ready for me, but the spear points all came together behind me. Then I saw him standing there, it was so quickly done." He had killed all the Cree.

8. THE JACKFISH THAT BECAME A MAN.'
A large eagle caught a jackfish and was carrying it to a tree. It fell into the middle of the lake and lived there until it grew to be a big fish. Finally, it was caught in a net. A girl, while eating it, suddenly stopped. She had a child on which there were fish scales. Her father started to throw it away but relented and gave the girl permission to raise it. When the child became a man, he used to tell his story in songs.
"When I was a small jackfish I stuck my nose in the grass by the shore. An eagle took me up suddenly and started with me toward his nest. I fell back into the middle of the lake~and became a large jackfish. Once, when swimming through the narrows, I thought I smelled something. As I swam around I thought I saw a small fish and bit him. I broke the fish line but could not eat because the hook was in my throat. Soon after, while swimming through the narrows, I thought I saw some algae but it was a net and I was caught. 'It is only a poor jackfish, just skin and bones,' he said of me and threw me by the shore. As I lay there I thought to myself, 'I wish a young girl who is pregnant would roast my tail.' Soon a nearly grown girl came there. 'I am going to roast that jackfish's tail,' I heard her say. She began to eat me, but as she was swallowing the last bit, I caused her belly to shake. She caught her breath and stopped chewing. I became a person."
This is what he told by means of songs in the sweat lodges. They found out from him what kind of a person he was.
Long ago, a man used to know something like this.

9. CEREMONY FOR OTTER.
A man in a dream heard some otters say. "They will kill us all, ahead there in the narrow. I am the only one who will be able to run away." He heard the otters singing this as they walked. When they came there to the narrows, he killed all of the otters except the one who had said this. He escaped. "That is why otters now come to me," he said. Sometimes when one sings that song the otters do not come to him because he only laughs.
1 This was given as a "story." The interpreter, Ennou, insisted that it was only a
story, but the relator immediately explained that it was ceremonial as the context plainly shows it to be.
The objects used were small pieces of the fat from'the tail of an otter, piece of moose tongue, tissue from the Inside of bear's tongue, "stone" from the head of a fish, tooth of a weasel, silk thread and beaver scent. These are tied to the hook as a charm.

10. MOOSE AND RABBIT.
One time Moose and Rabbit were having a contest. They were then of the same size and were without names. They were fighting to see who would be moose.
"The one who is the stronger will be moose," one of them proposed. They began to wrestle near the fire. Rabbit was pushed near the fire and stepped into it with both his hind feet which were burned. Then moose fell back and singed his rump in the fire. Since then the rumps of moose look as if they had been burned. Rabbit's feet were so drawn up that he could not be moose.

11. BEAR AND SQUIRREL.'
Bear once said, "There will only be night. In the summer, when the -nights are not long, I cannot find anything good to eat. For that reason there shall only be night." Then Squirrel, who was his younger brother, -replied, " If there is only night how would you manage to live without being able to see?" "I could find food by smelling it," Bear replied. "But," asked Squirrel, "what would you do if something should stick in your nostrils?" "Oh, I could feel for food with my paw," Bear suggested.
" Well, but if you should stick something in your paw, what then? " Squirrei asked. "Why, then I would, roll around until I found something," Bear said. "But if something should stick through your body, you would kill yourself," Squirrel warned him. "Well, then, let there be daylight," conceded Bear.
"Come let us have some contests," said Bear. "The one who jumps the farthest will be Bear." Bear won. "Let us see who can jump the highest over a tree," Bear again proposed. Bear won again. " Let us see who can run around this small lake first," Bear said. Because Bear was the larger (being the elder brother) and Squirrel the smaller, Bear was first to run around the lake. Bear had beaten him each time, but not fairly.
Squirrel, still saying, "I will be Bear," began to cry. His eyes became red and the tears made stripes below his eyes. Finally he said, "I shall not be good for anything. .I shall just amuse the children." Then he climbed a spruce and became small.
: This controversy between the squirrel and the bear concerning the prevalence of light -or darkness is mentioned In a myth concerning the end of the world recorded by Petitot (p. 373) at Great Slave Lake in 1862. In this myth of Petitot the bears have all the elements suspended in bags from an enormous tree and the other animals succeed in securing the one which contains heat and unintentionally let it loose upon the earth resulting in a flood.

Bear again spoke, " When there is no other meat, I will be a supply for them." He ran along the side of the world and went inland where he became large.
12. BEAVER AND MUSKRAT.

Beaver and Muskrat were brothers living together by a lake. The oldest could swim very fast. Beaver said to Muskrat, the older brother, "Lend me your tail; I want to try it." "No, I will not lend it to you, for any length of time," Muskrat replied. "Well then, we will exchange tails for a short time," Beaver said.
Muskrat gave Beaver his tail with which he was able to swim fast. After Beaver had swam around for a while Muskrat suggested that they exchange hands. "First put my.tail on me again," Beaver said. He put it back in the proper position but Beaver put Muskrat's tail on edgewise. Since then he has not been able to swim fast. He became angry toward his young brother. He has been mean tempered ever, since, and that -is why he is called bedjede dzene "mean muskrat."

13. THE BoY WHO BECAME STRONG.'
In the beginning a woman was walking along with her boy. They came where a bi-colored ribbon lay on a tree. "I am going to take it," the boy said to his mother. "No, you must not," she told him, "it belongs to someone." When they had walked on a little way the boy asked his mother toe go on ahead as he wished privacy for a moment. When she was out of sight he hurried back, took the ribbon, cut off a piece two yards long and tied it around his waist. Because of that ribbon he became very strong so that he was able to tear up even large trees by the roots. His mother who did not-know the source of his strength wondered how he could do this.
They went along in this manner until they came where two maneating giants lived. There was much human flesh hanging in the house. When they went in the boy was not afraid of the giants but looked around: at everything in the house. "Feed us," said one of the giants to the boy. He took up a knife as if he were about to kill him, but the boy was not frightened. He began to handle all the implements and then the giants
l Prof. G. L. Kittredge has identified this tale as one of the " Blue Band " group common in Northern Germany and Scandinavia. It will be found in Mtlllenhoff, Karl, " Sagen Miirchen und Lieder der Herzogthtimer Schleswig Holstein u. Lauenburg," pp. 416-420, Kiel, 1845. A translation Is in Thorpe, Benjamin, " Yule-Tide Stories," pp. 431435, London, 1853.

began to be afraid and let him alone. The mother married- one of the giants but the boy lived by himself near by. He stayed there a long time making all sorts of things and the giants were afraid of him because he was so strong.
After a time his mother became sick. When she had been ill some time
and it seemed she could not live the boy came to her and said, "Mother what can I do so that you may live?" The mother replied, "Way over there are many good berries. If I could eat them I might live." "Then I will get them for you," the boy replied. He started out, and when he had gone many miles found some good berries which he thought must be the ones his mother meant. He found -one hundred large panthers guarding them. The panthers were all asleep and he stepped along among the sloughs until he came within a mile when one of the panthers woke. "A boy is stealing our berries," he called- to the others. Then the boy seized one of the panthers and with it as a club killed all the others. Taking the berries, he went back to his mother who recovered after having eaten them. The boy lived outside as he had done before.
After a long time his mother fell sick again. She lost flesh so that it seemed she could not live. The boy came to his mother again and asked her what had happened. "Son, I shall not live," she replied. "Mother, what can I do that you may live?" he asked her. "Way over there is some water which smells a little. If you could bring me some of that I might live," she told him. He started after it and found" water that smelled a little hanging in the top of a tree near a house which was standing there. The boy began to climb after it, but when he was half way up a mean man came out of the house. "Boy, you will die. You are stealing my water," he said. He was carrying a huge- iron cane. The boy came down the tree, took the cane from him and struck him on the crown of his head with it, killing him. He then went in the house and looked all around. When he went upstairs he saw a young woman sitting there. "Why do you sit here?" he asked. "A mean man' stole me, and I had a child for him long ago," she replied. "Well, go to your home wherever it is. I have killed the man who held you a prisoner. Do not be afraid," he told her. He took some of the water and carried it back to his mother. He gave her some of it and she recovered. The boy lived outside as before.
Again after a long time the boy's mother was dangerously sick. The boy said, "Mother, what is the one 'thing I can do so that you may live?" "My son, it is something difficult," she said. "I must know what is the source of your strength, on that condition only may I live." "Then you are planning my death," replied the boy. "I took that ribbon which we passed long ago and tied it around me. I am strong by means of that." He gave the ribbon to his mother saying, " Now do whatever you intend."

When the woman had tied the ribbon around her waist she became strong. "My son, let us walk over there," she proposed to her son. She began to pull up trees, even large ones. They came to a very large spruce. " Climb this one," she said to the boy. The boy began climbing it with his mother behind him. She pricked his eyes out and left him.
The boy, blind and helpless, started off alone. He soon heard a sledge coming, drawn by dogs. He could hear the bells and knew someone was approaching. When they came up to him, one of the men said, "This is the sort we are looking for. We are taking the unfortunate with us." They brought him to the settlement and gave him into the care of an old man. This old man, who was cook for the big chief, loved the boy. He lived with him a long time.
This big chief, for whom the old man was cook, sent out invitations to bring about the marriage of his daughters. The men were to gather and the daughters were to make their own selections. On the day the selections were to be made, the old man who was the cook said to the blind young man, "My grandchild, let us go over there where the chief's daughters are to be married and see the people." "Grandfather," the young man replied, "it is no use for me to go. I cannot see anything and the people will just make fun of me." "Oh, that does not matter," said the old man, "we will go anyway." The young man finally consented and the old man led him to the house and gave him a seat on the floor just inside the door.
They found the house already full. There were many minor chiefs there. The big chief had three daughters two of whom had already chosen rich men for their husbands. The remaining daughter chose the blind young man. She was the girl he had rescued many years before when his mother had sent him for the water. When he killed the mean man and sent her home, she had made a vow that if she ever saw him again she would marry him. As soon as he came into the house she recognized him. Her father was very angry and said, " My daughter, because you have chosen to marry a blind man I will not keep you. Go away from me to-day somewhere where I will never see you again." Then he gave her much money and provided her with a large boat and servants.
They went away in the boat. The young man was not happy although he was married, for he thought she had taken him because he was unfortunate and she pitied him, but his wife loved him to the limit of her ability and kissed him. When it was noon and they were stopping to eat she proposed to her blind husband that while the servants were making tea they should go to a neighboring hill. "No," the young man said, "you are only planning to take me there to desert me. I will not walk with you." "Oh, no," his wife replied, " I have loved you for a long time because you saved

-my life. It is only on that account I wish to lead you there." "Well," consented the blind man, "Lead me there." They started up the hill and soon came to a large lake. A large moose was approaching feeling its way along as if searching for something. "A blind moose is coming this way," said the wife to her husband. "It acts as if it were searching for something." "Let us watch it," said the man. When the moose came to the water it waded in, put its head under water and held it there some time. When it raised its head, it looked about. It put its head down again and held it under the water. When it raised its head its eyes were all right again. Then the woman said, "The moose put its head in the water and its eyes became good again. You do that." "I will not do it," replied the man. "It is because you wish me to drown you say that." "No," said the woman, "the moose's eyes are certainly good. You do that too, and the same thing will happen to you." "Well, I will do it," he said. The woman lead him to the lake. When he had held his head in the water some time he raised it again, "Well, your eyes seem a little improved," his wife said. "You look like a small woman," he told her. "Well, do it again," she advised him. He put his head in the water again. When he raised his head he said, " I can certainly see."
Then they went back to their servants. The young man said, "I will go where my mother is." He started toward his mother's house accompanied by the servants but without his wife. When he came near to the place where he used to live he went close and saw that the ribbon was indeed lying there. At night they went into the house. He took the ribbon and tied it on again. The next night when the sun had set he went there again and killed his mother and his two fathers.
Then he went again to his wife and they returned to her father's house. When they came there his father-in-law saw his eyes were good again. He welcomed him gladly, and urged him to live with him and promised he should have all he possessed. The young man did so and became a great chief.'

14. How LOT KILLED THE DUCKS.
There were many ducks flying about. When Lot came there he could not get a shot at them. Near by, was a large hill above the top of which the ducks were flying about. He came there and seeing a tall spruce climbed it. As the ducks flew by, he shot and killed many of them. He is the only man who knows how to kill ducks in this manner.

15. ENNOU's HUNTING TRIP.
After there had been three weeks of cold, snow, and wind, the weather cleared. We started on the trip and camped that night six miles away. The next night we reached the base of Goose Lake where we camped for the night. As we were going along the shore, the next morning, we all saw a moose. I went toward it but did not succeed in killing it. We saw three moose that day. I shot at the nose of one which was all that could be seen of it and missed it. That was why I did not kill any that day.
We went on from there but the snow was four feet deep and I had to tramp back and forth to make a road. Finally, we came to a small lake called Big Log Lake. From there we went to Wolf Lake where we stayed for a short time. Going out from that place, I set traps for lynx. I killed one. We went on from there to the opposite side of Black Fox Lake. We camped there three weeks during which time I killed nine lynx. We walked to White Fish Lake. I killed one lynx on the way. There was a beaver house at the lake. I chiseled through it with the help of a young woman. While we were there some wolves came after us. We had no gun. We killed four beaver at White Fish Lake outlet.
I went back for the traps and other property. It was a two day's journey, but I brought back seven lynx. Starting down the White Fish River one morning, we came where there were beaver living, five of which we killed. From there we went to Big Beaver Lake where I trapped a lynx and we chiseled out three beaver and killed one mink. We then turned back, traveling over the same way we had come. Nine lynx had been caught in the traps set as we first passed over the road, but one had gotten away taking the trap. The next morning I went after this one with the dogs. With the help of the dogs, I killed, that day, one moose and a lynx. We came back from there to Goose Lake at the outlet of which we found some Indians. At the narrows there were more Indians. Finally, we came back to Cold Lake and into the Reserve and stopped at Alfos house. I had twenty-five lynx, six beavers, and one mink. I sold them to Baptiste Jacob for four hundred ninety dollars, two horses, and a spring wagon. I also bought a cow. I could not tell in a whole day all that happened on that trip.

16. THE DEATH OF EDALAKONE.
Edalakone became angry with his wife and daughter. He went away from them in his canoe, saying, "I will not live with you longer." After he had been gone two days, we went to look for him. Then next day, many joined in the search. Although it was summer, we found his tracks which we followed until noon. While we were stopping for lunch one of the two dogs which had left with him returned to our fire. There were eight men and two women in the company. When we had eaten, we again followed the tracks. After we had gone about half a mile, the three of us who were ahead, thought we saw something. An old man named Samuel Egu asked us to wait for him while he went ahead. When he had gone forward about twenty paces, he stopped. There was Edalakone with one of the dogs lying at his back. Samuel started to laugh but did not. Edalakone lay there dead. His going away angry into the brush did not turn out well for him. The others came there where we were.
