Ju st o ne of the reasons ...·h y all of these stories are un5.ltisfying is that they end too soon. The last sce ne h;u got to be more than a $late in which people nJme thiniS and evoke memortu.
Suggestions about Ihe origin of language are frequently embedded in discussions of the eHe nlial or criterial fcatures of language. And in the way that many languageorigin uoriu h;l.\e concentnted o n single clilical evenn, milny inquiries into language es~entials arc concerned with the discovery of some single trait or cluster of !rails thai separates human Iilnluale from everything else. The iluempt to give a Hkey feahlfe- definition of language has had rome of the same kif'ld of history that \I..e see in the definition of man, namely one in which the official definition undergoes cha nge s. no t becau~e of new kno .....ICllge ilboutthe thing being defined , but through thc lIisco\·ery of new bcn about the reu of the world.

I think Ihere is mu,h 10 be gained by separatinl the effon 10 charaClerile language from Ihe effort 10 determine what is uni4uely human in language . The q \Je~ lI on , "Wha l can ft>lh do Ihal beasts can'I~·· need not be regarded as I necesury part of thc inquiry into the nature of human language, There arc certain general dangers in the comparati\'e approach 10 characterizing language.

The pari of linguistic knowledge Ihat can be repftscnted by rules ma kes up t he I ,amma, of the speaker'. language; the part that cannol be so represented ·- that is. the p.an Ihat represcnlS ilem-by-item knowledge- mates up Ihe kJ(;ron.

The parIS of this universal structure that cannot be lI;Counted for by Ippeal to common experiences or

My effort is 10 look for what can be known about Ihe workings o f language through a consideration of the processes of communication. A proposallhat I (avor is tttal in charaCieriling a langulge system we must add 10 the description of grammar and lui,on iI descriplion of the cognitive and interactional M(rames- in terms of which the languasc·user interprels his environment, formulales his own messalles, understands the messages of olhers, and accumulates or creates a n internal model of his ....orld. The evolution fOlI"ardlaniuale must have consisted in part in the gcadu;!1 acquisition of a rtptrtory of barnes and of menial processcs lor operating .,..ilh them, and evenlually the capacity 10 create ne..... frames and to uansmill hem. In considerinlthe evolution uj la nguaie, we may fintJ Ihat degrees of genera l langu"ge comple"ity among Ihe I llened languages an be described partly in lerms of the relative utent of elaboration of the syuem of frames and of the ways in .'wlli,h these
Ire codified in the vocabulary and in the Irammatical categories of the languale. There ale severMI nOlions that mOll:;e up the background to what 1 have in mind,
a nd these are: the concept of contut, the concept of prototype or pamdi8m case, the notion "frame" or Mschema- IS it is used in recent work in psychology and artil1cial intelligenl:«:, and the notion that sometimes ,oes by the name ofMKmanlic memory."
In discussions of meaning, the notion of contut appears in severa l different

We can spt.1k of the (ontut of an utterance (or utterance fragment) and intend by that either Ihe real,wolld situation in which the ulICranc~ is produced or the other ullerancts that surround it in a discourse.
