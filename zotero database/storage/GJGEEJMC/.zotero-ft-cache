Preface
Cognitive science is a new field that brings together what is known about the mind from many academic disciplines: psychology, linguistics, anthropology, philosophy, and computer science. It seeks detailed answers to such questions as: What is reason? How do we make sense of our experi-
ence? What is a conceptual system and how is it organized? Do all people
use the same conceptual iystenT? If so, what is that system? If not, exactly
what is there that is common to the way all human beings think? The questions aren't new, but some recent answers are.
This book is about the traditional answers to these questions and about
recent research that suggests jiew answers._Qn the traditional view, rea-

The traditional account claims that the capacity for meaningful thought and for reason is abstract and not necessarily embodied in any organism.
Thus, meaningful concepts and rationality are transcendental, in the sense that they transcend, or go beyond, the physical limitations of any organism. Meaningful concepts and abstract reason may happen to be embodiedin-human beings, or in machines, or in other organisms—but they. exist abstractly, independent of any particular embodiment. In the new view, meaning is a matter of what is meaningful to thinking, functioning

(ö) independently of the bodily nature of the beings doing the categorizing and (6) literally, with no imaginative mechanisms (metaphor, metonymy, and imagery) entering into the nature of categories. In the new view, our^bßdily experience and the way we use imaginative mechanisms
are central to hosL^e_CQnstruct^ca_tegories to make sense of experience.
Cognitive science is now in transition."The traditional view is hanging on, although the new view is beginning to take hold. Categorization is a central issue. The traditional view is tied to the classical theory that categories are defined in terms of common properties of their members.
But a wealth of new data on categorization appears to contradict the
traditional view of categories. In its place there is a new view of categories, what Eleanor Rosch has termed the theory of prototypes and basiclevel categories. We will be surveying that data and its implications.
.T^e^a^i^BaLYlSW-^~a-Ellll2s-9£}lical-Qn&- It has come out of two
thousand" years of philosophizing about the nature of reason. It is still
widely believed despite overwhelming empirical evidence against it.
There are two reasons. The first is simply that it is traditional. The accumu-
lated weight of two thousand years of philosophy does not go away over-
night. We have all been educated to think in those terms. The second
reason is that there has been, until recently, nothing approaching a well-
worked-out alternative that preserves what was correct in the traditional
view while modifying it to account for newly discovered data. This book will also be concerned with describing such an alternative.
We wül be calling the traditional view^/ecrivum for the following reason: Modemattempts to maFe it work assume that rational thought consists of the manipulation of abstract symbols and that these symbols
get their meaning via a correspondence with the world, objectively con-
strued, that is, independent of the understanding of an^ organism. A collection of symbols priced m correspondence with an objectively structured world is viewed as a representation of reality. On the objectivist view, all rational thought involves the manipulation of abstract symbols
which are given meaning only via conventional correspondences with things in the external world.
Among the more specific objectivist views are the following:
- Thought is the mechanical manipulation of abstract symbols. - The Qimdjs an abstract machine, manipulating symbols essentially in
the way a camputer does, that is, bY_al^onthmic computatiQ.n.
- Syjnbols (e.g., words and mental representations) get tEeir meaning
via correspondences to things in the external world. All meaning is of
this character.

- Symbols that correspond to the external world are internal representa-

tions of external reality.

- Abstract symbols may stand in correspondence to things in the world

independent of the peculiar properties of any organisms.

nal reality, the mind is a mirror of nature, and correct reason mirrors

Though such views are by no means shared by all cognitive scientists, they are nevertheless widespread, and in fact so common that many of them
are often assumed to be true without question or comment. Many, perhaps even most, contemporary discussions of the mind as a computing machine take such views for granted.
The idea of a category is central to such views. The reason is that most
symbols (i.e., words and mental representations) do not designate particular things or individuals in the world (e.g., Rickey Henderson or the Golden Gate Bridge). Mostj5f^uLWpjds^and^CQncepts designate categories. Some of these are ^tegQries of things or Ueilig^in, the physicdr world—chairs and zebras, for example. Others are categories of activities,
and^^bstracühmgs—singing and songs, voting and governments, etc. To avery large extent, the ob j ecu vist view of language and thought rests on

i L

xiv Preface
the nature of categories. On the objectivist view, things are in the same
category if and only if they have certain properties in common. Those properties are necessary and sufficient conditions for defining the cate-
gory.
On the objectivist view of meaning, the symbols used in thought get their meaning via their correspondence with things—particular things or
categories of things—in the world. Since categories, rather than individuals, matter most in thought and reason, a category must be the sort of thing that can fit the objectivist view of mind in general. All conceptual categories must be symbols (or symbolic structures) that can designate categories in the real world, or in some possible world. And the world
must come divided up into categories of the right kind so that symbols and symbolic structures can refer to them. "Categories of the right kind" are classical categories, categories defined by the properties common to all
^their^members.
^j j ^^j Inrecent years, conceptual categories have been studied intensively \^' and in great detail in a number of the cognitive sciences—especially an-
thropology, linguistics, and psychology. The evidence that has accumulated is in conflict with the objectivist view of mind. Conceptual categories are, on the whole, very different from what the objectivist view requires of them. That evidence suggests a very different view, not only of categories, but of human reason in general:
- Thought is embodied, that is, thestrugtures used to put together our conceptual systems grow_out_of^bodil^experience and make sense in terms of it; moreover, the core of our conceptual systems is directly grounded in perception, body movement, and experience of a physi-
cal and social character.
- Thought is imaginative, in that those concepts which are,

^l^ggLThe imaginative capacity is also embodied^indirSctly—since
the metaphors, metonymies, and images are based on experience, of ten bodily experience. Thought is also imaginative in a less obvious way: every time we categorize something in a way that does not mirror nature, we are using general human imaginative capacities. - Thought has ges talt properties and is thus not atomistic; concepts have an overall structure that goes beyond merely putting together concep-
tual "building blocks" by general rules.
- Thought has an ecological structure. The efficiency of cognitiyejyu-

cessmg, as in learning and memory^ depends on the overall structure oftheconceptuSTsysfenranaon what the concepts mean. Thought is thus more than just the mechanical manipulation of abstract symbols. - Conceptual structure can be described using cognitive models that
have the above properties.
- The theory of cognitive models incorporates what was right about the traditional view of categorization, meaning, and reason, while accounting for the empirical data on categorization and fitting the new
view overall.

I will refer to the new view as^ex^ecientiah-ealism or alternatively asex-^

_ßenentialisni_rl'he term experiential realism emphasizes what experien-

tialism shares with objectivism: (a) a commitment to the existence of the

real world, (&) a recognition that reality places constraints on concepts,

(c) a conception of truth that goes beyond mere internal coherence, and

(rf) a commitment to the existence of stable knowledge of the world.

Both names reflect the idea that thought fundamentally grows out of

embodiment. "Exßerisnce" here is taken in a broad ratherthan a narrow

sense. It includes everything that goes to make up actual or potentiaT

experiences of either individual organisms or communities of organisms

ö —not merely perception, motor movement, etc., but^s^ecially the

internal genetically acquired makeup of the^qrganism and the nature of its

interactions in both its pTiysfcal and its _social environments.

Experientialism is thus defined in contrast with objectivism, which

holds that the characteristics of the organism have nothing essential to do

with concepts or with the nature of reason. On the objectivist view, hu-

man reason is just a limited form of transcendental reason. The only roles

accorded to the body are (a) to provide access to abstract concepts, (&) to

provide "wetware," that is, a biological means of mimicking patterns of i •v,,,..^»,

transcendental reason, and (c) to place limitations on possible concepts

and forms of reason. On the experientialist view, reason is made possible

The issue is this:

Do meaningful thought and reason concern merely the manipulation of
abstract symbols and their correspondence to an objective reality,
independent of any embodiment (except, perhaps, for limitations imposed by the organism)?

xvi Preface
Or do meaningful thought and reason essentially concern the nature of the orgaiyg.rg.jlfimgjbe^tlyiilgng—including the nature of its body, its
interactions in its environment, its social character, and so on?
Though these are highly abstract questions, there does exist a body of evidence that suggests that the answer to the first question is no and the answer to the second is yes. That is a significant part of what this book is
about.
Why does all this matter? It^matters for our understanding of who we ^ire as human beings and for all that follows from that understanding. The capacity to reason is usually taken as defining what human beings are and as distinguishing us from other things that are alive. If we understand reason as being disembodied, then our bodies are only incidental to what we are. If we understand reason as mechanical—the sort of thing a computer can do—then we will devalue human intelligence as computers get more efficient. If we understand rationality as the capacity to mirror the world external to human beings, then we will devalue those aspects of the mind that can do infinitely more than that. If we understand reason as merely
literal, we will devalue art.

embodied, then we will want to understand the relationship between the ^mnd_aüd_the body^and to find out how to cultivate the embodied aspects of reason. If we fully appreciate the role of the imaginative aspects of reason, we will give them full value, investigate them more thoroughly, and provide better education in using them. Our ideas about what people can learn and should be learning, as well as what they should be doing with what they learn, depend on our concept of learning itself. It is important that we have discovered that learning for the most part is neither rote learning nor the learning of mechanical procedures. It is important that we have discovered that rational thought goes well beyond the literal and the mechanical. It is important because our ideas about how human minds should be employed depend on our ideas of what a human mind is.
It also matters in a narrower but no less important way. Our understanding of what reason is guides ojj^^yrren^research^on the nature of reason. At present, that research is expanding faster th~an at any time in history. The research choices made now by the community of cognitive scientists will shape our view of mind for a long time to come. We are at present at an important .tunung^omt in the history of the study of the
mind. It is vital that the mistaken views about the mind that have been
with us for two thousand years be corrected.

Preface xvii
This book attempts to bring together some of the evidence for the view that reason is embodied and imaginative—in particular, the evidence that comes from the study of the way people categorize. Conceptual systems are organized in terms of categories, and most if not all of our thought involves those categories. The objectivist view rests on a theory of categories that goes back to the ancient Greeks and that even today is taken for granted as being not merely true, but obviously and unquestionably true. Yet contemporary studies of the way human beings actually categorize things suggest that categorization is a rather different and more complex
matter.
What is most interesting to me about these studies is that they seem to
provide evidence for the experientialist view of human reason and against the objectivist view. Taken one by one, such studies are things only
scholars could care about, but taken as a whole, they have something
f magnificent about them: evj^encejhat the mind is more than a mere mir-
rorof nature or a processor ofsymbols, that it is not incidental to the mind ^ffft ^J
that we have bodies, and that the capacity for understanding and mean0 ingful thought goes beyond what any machine can do.

These structures are directly meaningful, first, because they are directly
and repeatedly experienced because of the nature of the body and its mode of functioning in our environment. (For a detailed discussion, see

CHAPTER

2. There are two ways in which abstract conceptual structure arises
from basic-level and image-schematic structure:
A. By metaphorical projection from the domain of the physical to
abstract domains.
B. By the projection from basic-level categories to superordinate
and subordinate categories.

Cognitive Semantics

stood because of their systematic relationship to directly meaningful

Given such an approach to meaningfulness, we will go on to characterize understanding in terms of meaningfulness, truth in terms of under-

goal in this chapter is to provide a general outline of what such a semantic

issues:

;f

This solution has the following basic characteristics:

truth, reason, knowledge, and objectivity.

- It is not subject to Putnam's critique because the concepts that are directly meaningful (the basic-level and image-schematic concepts) are directly tied to structural aspects of experience. This makes the
account of meaningfulness internal to human beings.
- Since bodily experience is constant experience of the real world that mostly involves successful functioning, stringent real-world constraints are placed on conceptual structure. This avoids subjectivism.
- Since image Schemas are common to all human beings, as are the principles that determine basic-level concepts, total relativism is ruled out, though limited relativism is permitted.
Experiential realism thus meets the criteria for being a form of internal realism. It is at present the only form of realism that makes sense of the phenomena discussed in this book.

In chapter 18, we will take up the issue of relativism and alternative con-
ceptual systems.
Dual Foundations
Empirical studies by such prototype theorists as Berlin, Rosch, Hunn, Mervis, B. Tversky, and others have isolated a significant level of human interaction with the external environment (the basic level), characterized by gestalt perception, mental imagery, and motor movements. At this level, people function most efficiently and successfully in dealing with discontinuities in the natural environment. It is at this level of physical experience that we accurately distinguish tigers from elephants, chairs from tables, roses from daffodils, asparagus from broccoli, copper from lead, etc. One level down, things are much more difficult. It is much harder to distinguish one species of giraffe from another than to distinguish a giraffe from an elephant. Our capacity for basic-level gestalt perception is not tuned to make easy, clear-cut distinctions at such lower
levels.

The studies of basic-level categorization suggest that our experience is preconceptually structured at that level. We have general capacities for

Kinesthetic Image Schemas

"basic" does not mean "primitive"; that is, basic-level concepts are not atomic building blocks without internal structure. The basic level is an intermediate level; it is neither the highest nor the lowest level of conceptual organization. Because of their gestalt nature and their intermediate status, basic-level concepts cannot be considered elementary atomic building blocks within a building-block approach to conceptual structure.

One of Mark Johnson's basic insights is that experience is structured in a
significant way prior to, and independent of, any concepts. Existing concepts may impose further structuring on what we experience, but basic experiential structures are present regardless of any such imposition of concepts. This may sound mysterious, but it is actually very simple and
obvious, so much so that it is not usually considered worthy of notice.

At the basic level of physical experience, many of the principles of objectivism appear to work well. Our intuitions that objectivism is "just common sense" seem to come from the preconceptual structure of our physical experience at the basic level. It is no accident that most of the
examples used to justify objectivism come from this level of physical

The Body in the Mind: The Bodily Basis of Meaning, Imagination, and Reason (Johnson, 1987) makes an overwhelming case for the embodiment of certain kinesthetic image schemas. Take, for example, a CONTAINER schema—a schema consisting of a boundary distinguishing
an interior from an exterior. The CONTAINER schema defines the most

experience.
Those real discontinuities in nature that are easy for people to perceive—say the differences between elephants and giraffes—correspond to the natural kinds that objectivists cite in justifying their views. The common philosophical examples of natural kinds—tigers, cows, water, gold, etc.—are all basic-level categories in the physical domain. Similarly, the kinds of examples that philosophers of language like to cite as
justifying objectivist semantics, sentences like

Lindner (1981) describes in detail what is involved in this for 600 verbs
containing the particle out, not just physical uses like stretch out and spread out, but in metaphorical uses like figure out, work out, etc. As Lindner observes, there are a great many metaphors based on the CONTAINER schema and they extend our body-based understanding of things in terms of CONTAINER Schemas to a large range of abstract concepts. For exampie, emerging out of a stupor is a metaphorical, not a literal emergence
from a container.
Let us consider some of th,e properties of this schema.

Such meaning postulates would be strings of meaningless symbols, but
would be "given meaning" by the set-theoretical models they could
be satisfied in.
On our account, the CONTAINER schema is inherently meaningful to peo-
pie by virtue of their bodily experience. The schema has a meaningful
configuration, from which the basic logic follows. In fact, on our account, the very concept of a set, as used in set-theoretical models, is understood in terms of CONTAINER Schemas (see case study 2 for details). Thus, schemas are not understood in terms of meaning postulates and their interpreta-

If container A is in container B and X is in A, then ^ is in B — which is the basis for modus ponens: If all A's are B's and X is an A, then J^is a 5. Aswe shall see in case study 2, the CONTAINER schema is the
basis of the Boolean logic of classes.

The PART-WHOLE Schema
Bodily experience: We are whole beings with parts that we can manipulate. Our entire lives are spent with an awareness of both our wholeness and our parts. We experience our bodies as WHOLES with PARTS. In order to get around in the world , we have to be aware of the PART-WHOLE structure of

Structural elements: A WHOLE, PARTS, and a CONFIGURATION.

The "basic logic" of image Schemas is due to their configurations as

parts. Their basic logic is a consequence of their configurations. This way

of understanding image Schemas is irreducibly cognitive. It is rather dif-

ferent from the way of understanding logical structure that those of us

raised with formal logic have grown to know and love. In formal logic

there are no such gestalt configurations. What I have called the "basic

logic" of a schema would be represented in formal logic by meaning

Basic logic: The schema is asymmetric: If A is a part of B, then B is not a
part of A. It is irreflexive: A is not a part of A. Moreover, it cannot be the
case that the WHOLE exists, while no PARTS of it exist. However, all the PARTS
can exist, but still not constitute a WHOLE . If the PARTS exist in the CONFIGURATION then and only then does the WHOLE exist. It follows that, if the PARTS are
destroyed, then the WHOLE is destroyed. If the WHOLE is located at a place P,

whole) with castes as parts—the highest caste being the head and the lowest caste being the feet. The caste structure is understood as being structured metaphorically according to the configuration of the body. Thus, it is believed (by those who believe the metaphor) that the maintenance'of the caste structure (the configuration) is necessary to the preservation of
society (the whole) The general concept of structure itself'is a metaphori-
cal projection of the CONFIGURATION aspect of PART-WHOLE structure. When we understand two things as being isomorphic, we mean that their parts stand in the same configuration to the whole.
The LINK Schema
Bodily experience: Our first link is the umbilical cord. Throughout infancy and early childhood, we hold onto our parents and other things, either to secure our location or theirs. To secure the location of two things
relative to one another, we use such things as string, rope, or other means
of connection.
Structural elements: Two entities, A and B, and LINK connecting them. Basic logic: If A is linked to B then A is constrained by, and dependent
upon, B. Symmetry: If A is linked to B, then B is linked to A.'
Metaphors: Social and interpersonal relationships are often understood in terms of links. Thus, we make connections and break social ties. Slavery is understood as bondage, and freedom as the absence of anv-
thing tying us down.
The CENTER-PERIPHERY Schema
Bodily experience: We experience our bodies as having centers (the trunk and internal organs) and peripheries (fingers, toes, hair). Similarly, trees
and other plants have a central trunk and peripheral branches and'leaves.
The centers are viewed as more important than the peripheries in two
ways: Injuries to the central parts are more serious (i.e., "not mendable
and often life threatening) than injuries to the peripheral parts. Similarly, the center defines the identity of the individual in'a way that the peripheral parts do not. A tree that loses its leaves is the same tree. A'person
whose hair is cut off or who loses a finger is the same person. Thus, the periphery is viewed as depending on the center, but not conversely: bad circulation may affect the health of your hair, but losing your hair doesn't
affect your circulatory system. Structural elements: An ENTITY, a CENTER, and a PERIPHERY.

Kinesthetic Image Schemas 275
Basic logic: The periphery depends on the center, but not vice versa.
Sample metaphors: Theories have central and peripheral principles. What is important is understood as being central.
The SOURCE-PATH-GOAL Schema
Bodily experience: Every time we move anywhere there is a place we start from, a place we wind up at, a sequence of contiguous locations connecting the starting and ending points, and a direction. We will use the term "destination" as opposed to "goal" when we are referring to a specifically spatial ending point.
Structural elements: A SOURCE (starting point), a DESTINATION (end point), a
PATH (a sequence of contiguous locations connecting the source and the destination), and a DIRECTION (toward the destination).
Basic logic: If you go from a source to a destination along a path, then you must pass through each intermediate point on the path; moreover, the
further along the path you are, the more time has passed since starting.
Metaphors: Purposes are understood in terms of destinations, and achieving a purpose is understood as passing along a path from a starting point to an endpoint. Thus, one may go a long way toward achieving one s purposes, or one may get sidetracked, or find something getting in one's way. Complex events in general are also understood in terms of a sourcepath-goal schema; complex events have initial states (source), a sequence of intermediate stages (path), and a final state (destination).
Other image Schemas include an UP-DOWN schema, a FRONT-BACK schema, a LINEAR ORDER schema, etc. At present, the range of existing Schemas and their properties is still being studied. Image Schemas provide particularly important evidence for the claim that abstract reason is a matter of two things: (a) reason based on bodily experience, and (b) metaphorical projections from concrete to abstract domains. Detailed evidence is provided by Johnson (1987). Johnson's argument has four parts:
- Image Schemas structure our experience preconceptually. - Corresponding image-schematic concepts exist. - There are metaphors mapping image Schemas into abstract domains,
preserving their basic logic.
- The metaphors are not arbitrary but are themselves motivated by
structures inhering in everyday bodily experience.
We have briefly discussed the first three parts of the argument, and will
discuss them further in case study 2. Let us turn to the fourth part.

Experiential Bases of Metaphors 111

Experiential Bases of Metaphors

This correlation provides an answer to questions 2 and 3:

liil
Each metaphor has a source domain, a target domain, and a source-to-
target mapping. To show that the metaphor is natural in that it is moti-
vated by the structure of our experience, we need to answer three ques-
tions:

2. VERTICALITY serves as an appropriate source domain for understanding QUANTITY because of the regular correlation in our experi-
ence between VERTiCALiry and QUANTITY.
3. The details of the mapping are motivated by the details of structural correlation cited above. Every detail of the metaphor is motivated

other domain, such as CONTAINMENT, FRONT-BACK, VERTICALITY, or
any other?
3. Why is DESIRED STATE mapped onto the DESTINATION, rather than
onto the SOURCE, or some other point?

The source domain is VERTICALITY; the target domain is QUANTITY. The ques-
tions to be answered are:

1. What makes VERTICALITY appropriate as a source domain?

2. Why is VERTICALITY rather than some other domain (such as contain-

ment, front-back, or any other) used to understand QUANTITY?

I" I

3. Why is MORE mapped onto UP, rather than onto DOWN?

In short why does this particular mapping occur, when so many others
are possible? Is it just an arbitrary fact, or is there a reason? The answer to question 1 is straightforward:

1. To function as a source domain for a metaphor, a domain must be
understood independent of the metaphor. VERTICALITY is directly understood, since the UP-DOWN schema structures all of our functioning
relative to gravity.

Again, the answer is that this metaphor is motivated by a structural correlation in everyday experience. Consider the common purpose of getting
to a particular location. From the time we can first crawl we regularly
have'as an intention getting to some particular place, whether for its own sake, or—even more commonly—as a subpurpose which must be fulfilled before some main purpose can be achieved. In such cases, we have apur-
pose—being in that location — that is satisfied by moving our bodies from a starting point A, through an intermediate sequence of locations, to the
end point B — and that satisfies the purpose. In this particular case, there is an identity between the domain of pur-
pose and the physical domain. In the domain of purpose, there is an initial state, where the purpose is not satisfied, a sequence of actions necessary to achieve the final state, and a final state where the purpose is satisfied.
Thus, there is a correlation in our experience, between a structure in the
purpose domain and a structure in the domain of movement:

The answers to questions 2 and 3 come from the existence of a structural

correlation in our daily experience that motivates every detail in this par-

ticular metaphorical mapping. Whenever we add more of a substance—

say, water to a glass—the level goes up. When we add more objects to a

^

and the level goes down. The correlation is overwhelming:

MORE correlates with UP. LESS correlates with DOWN.

Initial State = Location A (starting point) Final (Desired) State = Location B (end point)
Action Sequence = Movement from A to 5 (motion along path)
This pairing in our experience is not metaphorical; it is a special case of
achieving a purpose, where that involves movement. It is, of course, an extremely important special case, since it is used over and over, every
day, and is absolutely vital to our everyday functioning in the physical
environment.

\

If we compare this structural correlation in a common experience with the details of the PURPOSES ARE DESTINATIONS metaphor, we find that there is an isomorphism between the structural correlation and the metaphori-
cal mapping. In the metaphor,

A. The state where the desire is unfulfilled and no action toward fulfill-
ing it has been taken is the starting point. B. The desired state is the end point.
C. The sequence of actions that allow one to achieve the purpose is the
movement.

Thus, our three questions get answered in the following way:

l. The SOURCE-PATH-GOAL schema is one of the most common structures

that emerges from our constant bodily functioning. This schema has

all the qualifications a schema should have to serve as the source

domain of a metaphor. It is (a) pervasive in experience, (b) well-

understood because it is pervasive, (c) well-structured, (d) simply

structured, and (e) emergent and well-demarcated for these rea-

I

sons. In fact, characteristics a-d provide some criteria for what it

means for a structure to "emerge" naturally as a consequence of our

experience.

2. There is an experiential correlation between the source domain

(movement along a path to a physical location) and the target

domain (achievement of a purpose). This correlation makes the

mapping from the source to the target domain natural.

3. The cross-domain correlations in the experiential pairing (for exam-

pie, desired state with final location) determine the details of the

metaphorical mapping (for example, desired state maps onto final

.1

location).

There are many structural correlations in our experience. Not all of

them motivate metaphors, but many do. When there is such a motivation,

the metaphor seems natural. The reason it seems natural is that the pair-

ing of the source and target domains is motivated by experience, as are

the details of the mapping.
The point is this: Schemas that structure our bodily experience precon-

I

ceptually have a basic logic. Preconceptual structural correlations in expe-

rience motivate metaphors that map that logic onto abstract domains.

Thus, what has been called abstract reason has a bodily basis in our every-

day physical functioning. It is this that allows us to base a theory ofmean-

ing and rationality on aspects of bodily functioning.

The Issue of Primitives 279
The Issue of Primitives
We have argued that our conceptual system has dual foundations—that both basic-level and image-schematic concepts are directly meaningful. This gives us a system that is grounded at two points. It also provides us with a situation that is odd from the point of view of objectivist semantic systems: strictly speaking, this system has foundations, but no primitives.
In objectivist semantic systems, the following principles of conceptual
structure hold by definition:
A. Every concept is either primitive or built up out of primitives by fully productive principles of semantic composition.
B. All internal conceptual structure is the result of the application of fully productive principles of semantic composition.
C. The concepts with no internal structure are directly meaningful,
and only those are.
But in the human conceptual system, as opposed to artificially constructed semantic systems, none of these principles holds.
- Basic-level and image-schematic concepts are the only directly mean-
ingful concepts, but both have internal structure. This violates C.
- The internal structure of both basic-level and image-schematic con-
cepts is not the result of the application of fully productive principles
of composition. This violates A and B.
In objectivist semantic systems, the following criteria converge to characterize what a conceptual primitive is. When we say that a conceptual
system has primitives, we usually mean that all of the following conditions
hold:
1. There are fully productive principles of semantic composition, building up more complex concepts from less complex ones. Those concepts not put together by fully productive principles of semantic composition are primitive.
2. Every concept either has internal structure or it does not. The ones with internal structure are complex. The concepts with no internal
structure are primitive.
3. Some concepts get their meaning directly. Those are the primitive concepts. Other concepts—the complex concepts—get their meaning indirectly via the principles of composition that relate them to
primitive concepts.
By criterion 3, the directly meaningful concepts are primitive. This means that basic-level and image-schematic concepts would have to be primi-

contains other primitives.

tion semantics in that they are partial; they do not require that everything
in the world be represented.
The major difference is that mental spaces are conceptual in nature. They have no ontological status outside of the mind, and hence have no role in an objectivist semantics. A mental space, unlike a situation or a possible world, is not the kind of thing that the real world, or some aspect

The Scenario 285

The Structure of ICMs
Each cognitive model (or ICM) is a structure consisting of symbols. There are two kinds of complex symbolic structures: building-block structures
and gestalt structures.
- A complex symbolic structure has a building-block structure if its structural elements all exist independently, and if the meaning of the whole is a function of the meanings of the parts.
- Otherwise, it has a gestalt structure, that is, a structure (a) whose elements do not all exist independent of the whole or (b) whose overall meaning is not predictable from the meanings of its parts and the way those parts are put together.
Directly-meaningful symbols all have gestalt structures. For example, the CONTAINER schema has an INTERIOR, EXTERIOR, and BOUNDARY; those parts do not all exist independent of the schema. The concept INTERIOR, for example, does not make sense independently of the CONTAINER gestalt. Similarly, all the other image-schemas are gestalts with structures of the sort described above. Basic-level concepts also have a gestalt structure, defined by in part by images and motor movements.
It should be noted that the term "symbol" is not used in the same way as in most other symbolic systems. In most symbolic systems, symbols are either entities (with no significant internal structure) or complexes with a building-block structure. The symbolic system we are describing differs in
that it has gestalt structures as well.
ICMs are typically quite complex structures, defined by image Schemas of all the sorts just discussed. Some symbols in an ICM may be directly meaningful: the basic-level and image-schematic concepts. Other symbols are understood indirectly via their relationship to directly understood concepts. Such relationships are defined by the image Schemas that
structure the ICMs.
We previously described ICMs as falling into five basic types: (a) image-schematic; (ft) propositional; (c) metaphoric; (d) metonymic; (e) symbolic. .We have already described image Schemas. Let us now turn to the propositional ICM. I will describe several common types: (a) the proposition; (b) the scenario (sometimes called a "script"); (c) the featare bundle; (d) the taxonomy; (e) the radial category. The examples are
intended to be suggestive, rather than authoritative or exhaustive. That
is, I will be illustrating the idea of a cognitive model, rather making any serious claims about what our cognitive models are like in detail.

Propositional ICMs
By a prepositional ICM, I mean one that does not use imaginative devices, i.e., metaphor, metonymy, or mental imagery. Each ICM has an ontology and a structure. The ontology is the set of elements used in the ICM. The structure consists of the properties of the elements and the relations obtaining among the elements. The elements in the ontology may be either basic-level concepts—entities, actions, states, properties, etc.—or they may be concepts characterized by cognitive models of other
types.
Propositional models have an objectivist flavor to them, since they contain entities, with their properties and the relations holding among them. It must be recalled, however, that they are cognitive models, not slices of reality. The "entities" are mental entities, not real things. I believe that the common tendency to view the world in objectivist terms comes from the fact that many of our cognitive models are objectivist in this limited respect. It seems to me that when we understand our experience by projecting propositional models onto it, we are imposing an ob-
jectivist structure on the world.
The Simple Proposition
The simple proposition itself is an example of what we are calling "propositional ICMs." A simple proposition consists of an ontology of elements (the "arguments") and a basic predicate that holds of those arguments. The overall structure of the proposition is thus characterized by a partwhole schema, where the proposition = the whole, the predicate = apart, and the arguments = the other parts. In addition, certain semantic relations may hold among the arguments: there may be an agent, a patient, an experiencer, an instrument, a location, etc. Semantic relations are represented structurally by link Schemas, and the kinds of Schemas are
represented by assignments of links to categories of relations (e.g., the
agent category). Complex propositions may be formed from simple ones by such well-
known devices as modification, quantification, complementation, conjunction, negation, etc.
The Scenario
A scenario consists fundamentally of the following ontology: an initial state, a sequence of events, and a final state. In other words, the scenario is structured by a SOURCE-PATH-GOAL schema in the time domain, where

i

286 Chapter 17

[ Graded Categories 287

- the initial state = the source
- the final state = the destination
- the events = locations on the path
and the path stretches through time. The scenario is a WHOLE and each of
these elements is a PART.
The scenario ontology also consists typically of people, things, properties, relations, and propositions. In addition, there are typically relations of certain kinds holding among the elements of the ontology: causal relations, identity relations, etc. These are represented structurally by link Schemas, each of which is categorized as to the kind of relation it represents. Scenarios also have a purpose structure, which specifies the purposes of people in the scenario. Such structures are represented meta-
phorically via SOURCE-PATH-GOAL Schemas, as discussed above.

The Relation between Concepts and Categories

In general, concepts are elements of cognitive models. Many concepts,

for example, are characterized in terms of scenario ICMs. The concept

WAITER is characterized relative to a restaurant scenario. The concept BUYER

is characterized relative to a commercial exchange scenario. The concept

Ill

SECOND BASEMAN is characterized relative to a baseball game scenario.

For every such concept, there can be a corresponding category: those

entities in a given domain of discourse that the concept (as characterized

by the cognitive model) ßts. If the concept is characterized in the model

purely by necessary and sufficient conditions, the category will be classi-

cally defined. It can give rise to simple prototype effects if it is possible for

entities in the domain of discourse to meet some background conditions

I)

of the model. It will give rise to metonymic prototype effects if the ICM

contains a metonymic mapping from part of the category to the whole

category. And if the concept is defined not by necessary and sufficient

conditions but by a graded scale, then the resulting category will be a

graded category.

Classical Taxonomic Structures
Classical categories and classical taxonomies are not built into nature or part of some transcendental rationality that goes beyond thinking beings. They are inventions of the human mind. Each classical taxonomy is an idealized cognitive model—a hierarchical structure of classical categories. The elements in the ontology of the taxonomic model are all categories. Each category is represented structurally by a CONTAINER schema. The hierarchy is represented structurally by PART-WHOLE and UP-DOWN Schemas. Each higher-order category is a whole, with the immediately lower categories being its parts. Each higher-level category contains all of its lowerlevel categories. At each level, the categories are nonoverlapping.
Classical taxonomies have fundamental semantic constraints. Each
category is classical—defined by feature bundles. Each member of each category has each of the properties contained in the feature bundles for that category. The feature bundles defining lower-level categories include all the features of the bundles defining higher-level categories.
A classical taxonomy is intended to be exhaustive—to categorize all
the entities in some domain in terms of their properties. The highest category in the taxonomy encompasses the entire domain.
Taxonomic ICMs are one of the most important structuring devices we have for making sense of what we experience. But it is important to recall that the taxonomic models are imposed by us, for our purposes. If we are fortunate, they will serve those purposes.
Radial Category Structure
Like other categories, a radial category is represented structurally as a container, and its subcategories are containers inside it. What distin-
guishes it is that it is structured by the CENTER-PERIPHERY schema. One subcategory is the center; the other subcategories are linked to the center by various types of links. Noncentral categories may be "subcenters," that is, they may have further center-periphery structures imposed on them.

Feature-Bundle Structures
A feature bundle is a collection of properties. The elements in the ontology are properties. Structurally, the bundle is characterized by a CONTAINER schema, where the properties are inside the container. Classical categories can be represented by feature bundles.

Graded Categories
Simple classical categories are represented as containers, with an interior (containing the members), an exterior (containing the nonmembers), and a boundary. In classical categories, the boundary is sharp and does not have any interior structure. But in graded categories, the boundary is fuzzy; it is given a "width," defined by a linear scale of values between 0

288 Chapter 17
and 1, with 1 at the interior and 0 at the exterior. Elements are not merely in the interior or exterior, but may be located in the fuzzy boundary area,
at some point along the scale between 0 ,and 1. That point defines the
degree of membership of the given element.
It is, of course, possible for two graded categories to be adjacent to one another (e.g., blue and green, chair and stool) and for their fuzzy boundaries to overlap in such a way that a given element may be in the fuzzy
boundaries of both at once, and therefore to be a member of each to some
degree between 0 and 1.
Graded Propositions ICMs characterizing propositions may, of course, contain linear scales. These may define the degree to which a given property holds of an indi-
vidual (e.g., the degree to which someone is tall or rich). That property can be taken as defining a graded category, where the degree of membership equals the degree to which each member has the given property. This
is a common way in which graded categories arise.
Metaphoric and Metonymie Models A metaphoric mapping involves a source domain and a target domain. The source domain is assumed to be structured by a propositional or
image-schematic model. The mapping is typically partial; it maps the structure of the ICM in the source domain onto a corresponding structure in the target domain. As we mentioned above, the source and target domains are represented structurally by CONTAINER Schemas, and the map-
ping is represented by a SOURCE-PATH-GOAL schema.
A metonymic mapping occurs within a single conceptual domain, which is structured by an ICM. Given two elements, A and 5, in the ICM,
A may "stand for" B. The "stands-for" relation is represented structurally by a SOURCE-PATH-GOAL schema. If 5 is a category and A is a member, or subcategory, of B, the result is a metonymic category structure, in which
A is a metonymic prototype.
Prototypes
Given the various possible category structures, prototype effects can
arise in a number of ways:
- Metonymy: Given category B, where A is either a member or subcategory of B, suppose that A metonymically "stands for" B. That is,

Symbolic Models and Cognitive Grammar 289
it is either a social stereotype, or a typical case, or an ideal, or a submodel, etc. Then, A will be a best example of B. - Radial Category: Given category B with a radial structure and A at its center, then A is the best example of B. - Generative Category: Suppose 5 is a category generated by rule from a subcategory or member, A. Then A is a best example of B. - Graded Category: Given a graded category B with A being a member of degree 1, then A is a best example of B. - Classical Category: Consider a cognitive model containing a feature bundle that characterizes a classical category B. If A has all the properties in the feature bundle, it is a best example of B. An element C, having some of the properties in the feature bundle, may be judged a less-good example of B. Strictly speaking, C will be outside B; but people, in such cases, may consider B a graded category, such that elements bearing a degree of similarity to members of B will be viewed as being members of 5 to a degree.
These, of course, are "pure" cases. Mixed cases also exist. Categories of numbers, for example, may have both generators and submodels. In such cases, there is no theory of which kinds of best examples take precedence.
No serious study of such phenomena exists at present.
Symbolic Models and Cognitive Grammar
Thus far, we have not discussed language at all. All the ICMs we have discussed so far have been purely conceptual; they have contained no elements of particular languages in them. The distinction is important. Purely conceptual ICMs can be characterized independently of the words and morphemes of particular languages. When linguistic elements are associated with conceptual elements in ICMs, the result is what we shall call a symbolic ICM. Let us now turn to the question of how natural languages can be described within this framework. We will begin with lexical items, grammatical categories, and grammatical constructions.
As Fillmore has established in his papers on frame semantics (Fillmore 1975, 1976, 1978, 1982ß, 1982&, and 1985), the meanings of lexical items—words and morphemes—are characterized in terms of cognitive models. The meaning of each lexical item is represented as an element in
an ICM. The ICM as a whole is taken as the background against which the
word is defined.
The traditional definition of the grammatical category noun as the name of a person, place, or thing is not that far off. The best examples of nouns are words for basic-level physical objects. Noun is a radial cate-

gory. Its central subcategory consists of names for physical entities—

people, places, things. Those are the prototypical nouns. There are, of

course, noncentral nouns: abstract nouns (like strength), and strange

nouns that occur only in idioms (like umbrage in take umbrage at). Verb is

also a radial category, with basic-level physical actions as central mem-

bers (e.g., run, hit, give, etc.). Thus, although grammatical categories as

a whole cannot be given strict classical definitions in semantic terms, their

central subcategories can be defined in just that way. The remaining

Ill

members of the each grammatical category can then be motivated by their

relationships to the central members.

Prototype theory thus permits us to state the general principles that

provide the semantic basis of syntactic categories. In a classical theory of

categories, one would be forced to say that there is no semantic basis at

all. The reason is that classical categories have a homogeneous

structure—there are no prototypes—and everything that is not com-

pletely predictable must be arbitrary. Since syntactic categorization is not

completely predictable from semantic categorization, a classical theory of

categories would be forced to claim, incorrectly, that it is completely

arbitrary. Take the case of adjectives, for example. As Dixon has shown

in his classic Where Have All The Adjectives Gone? (Dixon 1982), lan-

guages may have no adjectives at all, or they may have a very small num-

ber: Igbo has eight, Hausa twelve, etc. These are not arbitrary. When a

language has a very small number of adjectives, one can pretty well pre-

diet what they will be : central adj ectival meanings like BIG-SMALL, GOOD-BAD

WHITE-BLACK, OLD-YOUNG, HARD-SOFT, etc. Thus, it is clear that general

principles relating semantic to syntactic categories do exist.

The theory of ICMs is especially useful in characterizing grammatical

constructions. Let us begin with the matter of linguistic structure in gen-

eral. As we observed above, image Schemas characterize conceptual

structure. They also characterize syntactic structure.

- Hierarchical syntactic structure (i.e., constituent structure) is characterized by PART-WHOLE Schemas: The mother node is the whole and the daughters are the parts.
- Head-and-modifier structures are characterized by CENTER-PERIPHERY
Schemas.
- Grammatical relations and coreference relations are represented
structurally by LINK Schemas.
- Syntactic "distance" is characterized by LINEAR SCALE Schemas. - Syntactic categories, like other categories, are characterized struc-
turally by CONTAINER Schemas.

Symbolic Models and Cognitive Grammar 291
Empirical evidence for this way of conceiving of syntactic structure is provided in chapter 20 of Lakoff and Johnson 1980.
Given such a view of the nature of syntactic structure, we can represent
grammatical constructions as ICMs. We can also characterize the meanings of grammatical constructions by directly pairing the syntactic aspect of the construction with the ICM representing the meaning of the construction. Once this is done, it is possible to state many generalizations governing the relationship between syntax and semantics. As we shall see in case study 3, many, if not most, of the details of syntactic constructions are consequences of the meanings of the constructions. (See Langacker 1986.) This allows for a great simplification of the description of gram-
matical constructions.
The concept of a radial category also permits us to show regularities in the structure of the grammar and the lexicon. Most words and morphemes have multiple meanings—meanings that are related to one another. These meanings can be seen as forming a radial category, in which there is a central meaning and a structure of related meanings which are motivated by the central meaning. (See Brugman 1983.) This view of the lexicon allows us to state general principles relating meanings of words. An extremely detailed example is worked out in case
study 2.
The idea of a radial category also allows us to state otherwise unstate-
able syntactic generalizations governing the relation of grammatical constructions to one another. (See Van Oosten 1984.) This is done by making
use of the concept of ecological location, the location of a construction
within a grammatical system. Constructions form radial categories, with a central construction and a number of peripheral constructions linked to
the center. Certain generalizations about the details of grammatical constructions can be stated only in terms of where a construction is located in
such a radial structure. For details, see case study 3.
In summary, linguistic expressions get their meanings via (a) being associated directly with ICMs and (&) having the elements of the ICMs either be directly understood in terms of preconceptual structures in experience, or indirectly understood in terms of directly understood concepts plus structural relations.
Language is thus based on cognition. The structure of language uses the same devices used to structure cognitive models—image Schemas, which are understood in terms of bodily functioning. Language is made meaningful because it is directly tied to meaningful thought and depends upon the nature of thought. Thought is made meaningful via two direct connections to preconceptual bodily functioning, which is in turn highly

[;'
constrained, but by no means totally constrained, by the nature of the

B: l

world that we function within.

In experiential realism, there is no unbridgeable gulf between language and thought on one hand and the world on the other. Language and thought are meaningful because they are motivated by our functioning as
part of reality.

Philosophical Issues

We are now in a position to characterize a general approach to a variety of

lii!!

philosophical issues: meaning, understanding, truth, knowledge, and

objectivity. Basic-level and image-schematic concepts are the founda-

tions of the approach. They are directly meaningful, since they put us in

touch with preconceptual structures in our bodily experience of function-

ing in the world. It is because the body is in the mind, as Johnson puts it,

that our basic-level and image-schematic concepts are meaningful.

Meaning

Meaning is not a thing; it involves what is meaningful to us. Nothing is

Ijl^

meaningful in itself. Meaningfulness derives from the experience of func-
tioning as a being of a certain sort in an environment of a certain sort.

Basic-level concepts are meaningful to us because they are characterized

by the way we perceive the overall shape of things in terms of part-whole

structure and by the way we interact with things with our bodies. Image

Schemas are meaningful to us because they too structure our perceptions

and bodily movements, though in a much less detailed way. Natural

metaphorical concepts are meaningful because they are based on (a)

directly meaningful concepts and (b) correlations in our experience. And

superordinate and subordinate concepts are meaningful because they are

grounded in basic-level concepts and extended on the basis of such things

as function and purpose.

Understanding
Let us begin with direct understanding. This requires characterizations of directly understood sentences and directly understood situations:
- A sentence is directly understood if the concepts associated with it are
directly meaningful.
- Aspects of a particular situation are directly experienced if they play a causal role in the experience. For example, I am not directly experi-

Understanding 293
encing everything in the room I am sitting in. My chair, for example, is held together by glue. I directly experience the chair, but not the glue. The chair is playing a causal role in my experience. The glue's
causal role involves the chair, but not my experience of the chair.
- An aspect of a directly experienced situation is directly understood if it is preconceptually structured.
Thus we have characterizations of directly understood sentences and directly understood situations. Truth relative to direct understanding can then be characterized as a correspondence between the understanding of the sentence and the understanding of the situation.
Let us take the usual example. Start with a directly understood sentence. It is possible to have a direct understanding of the proverbial The cat is on the mat, since CAT and MAT are basic-level concepts (presumably . with associated mental images) and ON is composed of three kinesthic image schemas: ABOVE, CONTACT, and SUPPORT. CAT, MAT, and ON are all directly understood concepts.
Now let us consider a directly understood situation. Say, you are look-
ing at (and thereby directly experiencing) a cat on a mat. Since both cat
and mat are basic-level concepts, you will have a perception of the overall
shape of both, as well as a perception of the relationship between them. Your perceptions of overall shape for the cat and the mat are preconceptually structured experiences of the cat and the mat. Your perception of
the relationship between the cat and the mat is a preconceptually structured experience of the kinesthic relations ABOVE, CONTACT, and SUPPORT. This makes the situation one that is directly understood.
The fit of the direct understanding of the sentence to the direct understanding of the situation works like this:
- The mental image associated with your basic-level concept of CAT can accord with your perception of the overall shape of a cat.
- The mental image associated with your basic-level concept of MAT can accord with your perception of a mat.
- The image Schemas that constitute your understanding of ON can accord with your perception of the relationship between the cat and
the mat.
If the direct understanding of the sentence is in overall accord with the direct understanding of the situation, then we can characterize truth relative to a direct understanding. This is, of course, not unproblematical, since one must also take the understanding of the background of the situation into account, as Searle (1979, chap. 5) has observed. And, most important, we need a precise account of "accord with?.?"

Il

294 Chapter 17

Sentences and situations are by no means all understood directly. The bulk of our understanding may well be indirect. An account of indirect understanding of both sentences and situations will therefore be needed. Sentences are not a problem: a sentence is indirectly understood if the concepts associated with it by the grammar are indirectly meaningful. But providing for the indirect understanding of situations is more difficult. Lakoff and Johnson (1980, chap. 24) provide an account of indirect metaphorical understanding. But at present there is no fully general account of how we understand situations indirectly.
Part of such an account of situational understanding will be a criterion of relative accuracy and good sense. Such a criterion would maximize directness of understanding. It would prefer understandings that are more direct to those that are less so. This would be analogous to Lewis's naturalness condition. Thus, although one might (metaphorically) try to understand a cherry in terms of the concept CAT, that understanding would be very indirect and therefore not nearly as accurate or as sensible as
using the concept CHERRY.
Experientialism is committed to a general account of understanding along these lines. This is necessary for an account of truth. Such an account of truth would make the following claim: If a sentence is true, it is true by virtue of what it means and how it is understood. Truth depends
on meaningfulness.

Truth

We understand a statement as being true in a given situation if our under-

standing of the statement fits our understanding of the situation closely

r

enough for our purposes. That is the basis of an experientialist account of truth. It is not abso-

lute. God's eye view truth. But it is what we ordinarily take truth to be.

One might well object, in response, that we ordinarily understand truth

as being absolute truth, objective truth, and not truth relative to any

understanding. Fair enough. But the discrepancy is readily explainable.

Truth is relative to understanding. But we commonly take understand-

ing to be an absolute. That is, we have a folk theory to the effect that:

- There is one and only one correct way to understand reality.

If truth is relative to understanding, and if understanding, according to
our folk theory, is fixed, then (in that folk theory) there is one and only one truth—absolute truth. This is our normal folk theory of truth. As with most folk theories, we can abandon it when forced to. When people
are placed in a situation where they can see that there are two or more

Created Realities 295
equally plausible understandings of a situation, then it is generally possible for them to see that truth can be relative to those understandings.
To conclude: The folk view that truth is absolute is a result of two
things—a characterization of truth as relative to an understanding plus a folk theory that there is one and only one correct way to understand reality. When there is only one conceivable understanding of a situation, then truth appears to be absolute. But when it is clear that more than one understanding is possible, then it becomes clear that truth is relative to understanding. (For empirical evidence supporting this, see Sweetser, in press.) Such an account of truth also explains how metaphors can be true, since metaphors provide understandings of experiences. (For details, see
Lakoff and Johnson 1980, chap. 23.)
Objectivist philosophers happen to take as paradigm cases situations that can be understood in only one plausible way. That is why they like to talk about cases like The cat is on the mat. On the assumption that it is clear what a cat is and what a mat is (they are, after all, basic level objects)
and that we have a normal situation—that we're not in outer space or something weird like that—then The cat is on the mat is either true or not, absolutely, objectively true or not. But take a trickier case like the story about "time theft" discussed above in chapter 13. The researcher, Robert Half, and the editors of the Oakland Tribune take it as true that em-
ployees steal time from their employers. But in order to have such a belief, they must understand time metaphorically as the sort of entity that can be stolen. Relative to such an understanding, the sentence Employees steal time from their employers can be true. The question is whether that way of understanding time should be accepted. Ways of understanding situations change in the course of history. The metaphorical understanding of time as something that can be "wasted" is only a recent innovation in the history of man, and it is certainly not a universally shared way of understanding time. But because it is accepted in present-day Western culture, there is no problem evaluating the truth of sentences like I wasted an hour this morning. They have achieved cat-on-the-mat status, because our understanding of time as something that can be wasted has become
conventional.
Created Realities
One of the major inadequacies of objectivist metaphysics is that it has no room for such humanly created realities as "wasted time." If we view time as a resource that can be wasted, and act upon that view, and even set up institutions that take such a view for granted, then, by our actions, we can create "wasted time." If I live in a society that is constructed on the TIME is

296 Chapter 17
A RESOURCE metaphor, and if I accept and function in terms of that metaphor, then it can be true that someone wasted an hour of my time this morning. This makes sense on an experientialist account of truth; it makes very little sense on an objectivist account of truth. Many of our most important truths are not physical truths, but truths that come about as a result of human beings acting in accord with a conceptual system that cannot in any sense be said to fit a reality completely outside of human experience. Human experience is, after all, real too—every bit as real as rocks and trees and cats and mats. Since we act in accord with our conceptual systems and since our actions are real, our conceptual systems have a major role in creating reality. Where human action is concerned, metaphysics, that is, our view of what exists and is real, is not independent of epistemology in the broad sense of human understanding and knowledge.
Truth as a Radial Concept
We saw above that categories of mind are often radially structured, with a central subcategory and extensions. I would like to suggest that the category of truths is similarly structured. Because, as we have seen, truth cannot be characterized simply as correspondence'to a physical reality, we must recognize truth as a human concept, subject to the laws of human thought. It should come as no surprise that it is structured the way other human concepts are structured.
Put briefly, the suggestion is this: there are central and noncentral truths. The central truths are characterized in terms of directly understood concepts, concepts that fit the preconceptual structure of experience. Such concepts are (0) basic-level concepts in the physical domain
and (&) general Schemas emerging from experience (what I have called
"kinesthetic image-schematic concepts"). Here are some examples of
such central truths:
I am writing this. There are three pens and a telephone on my desk. I am sitting ori a green chair. There is a table to my left. There is a lamp to my right and it is on. Through my window, I can see houses, trees, the bay, some mountains, and a bridge.
There is nothing exciting or controversial here, just simple truths. Note the basic-level physical objects: pens, a telephone, a chair, a table, a desk, a lamp, a window, houses, trees, the bay, a bridge. These sentences (like many of the example sentences in the philosophical literature) have a decidedly Dick-and-Jane quality about them. They are very different from the other sentences in this book, most of which I hope you will find true, but few of which are simple central truths, concerning only basic-

Knowledge 297
level physical objects. Central truths are true by virtue of the directness of the fit between the preconceptual structure of experience and the concep-
tual structure in terms of which the sentence is understood. But most of
the sentences we speak and hear and read and write are not capable of expressing central truths; they are sentences that contain concepts that are very general or very specific or abstract or metaphorical or metonymic or display other kinds of "indirectness" relative to the direct structuring of experience. Not that they need be any less true, but they aren't central examples.
Truth is very much a bootstrapping operation, grounded in direct links to preconceptually and distinctly structured experience and the concepts that accord with such experience. But most cases of truth involve indirectness. That is, they make use of indirect understanding: higher-level categories, metaphoric and metonymic understanding, abstractions, etc. To me, this is the most interesting kind of truth—noncentral truth. Such truths are the ones least compatible with objectivist views of truth.
Knowledge
What does it mean to know something and how is knowledge possible? When an objectivist asks this question, certain parts of the answer are taken to be obvious: If you know something, then what you know is true—objectively true. Knowledge is possible at least partly because the categories of mind can fit the categories of the world—the objectively given external world, which comes complete with objective categories. We have scientific knowledge when our scientific theories fit the objective
facts of the world.
When objectivism is abandoned, our understanding of what knowledge is must change. What takes its place? If truth, as we suggested, is a radial concept, then so is knowledge. The best examples of knowledge are things that we know about basic-level objects, actions, and relations in the physical domain—what might be called our cat-on-the-mat knowledge, our knowledge about chairs and tables and trees and rocks and our own bodies and other basic-level objects in our immediate environment. The best examples of truths are best examples of objects of knowledge.
We get our basic knowledge of our immediate physical environments from our basic-level interactions with the environment, through perceiving, touching, and manipulating. We may get our other knowledge either directly (as in the case of emotional and social knowledge) or indirectly (as in the cast of knowledge acquired by others and transmitted, say, by newspapers, textbooks, etc.). But the things we feel we know best are those that can be most closely related to basic-level experience.

298 Chapter 17

Much of our technology is aimed in the direction of expanding basic-

level experience. Telescopes, microscopes, photography, and television

all extend basic-level perception in the visual domain. How do we know

that Saturn has rings? We can see them through a telescope—or at least

see pictures taken through somebody else's telescope. How do we know

that there are bacteria? We can see them through a microscope—or at

least see photographs of them. It doesn't really matter if one doesn't

know why a microscope works or that one has to learn to see through mi-

croscopes. (See Hacking 1983, chap. 11 for a discussion.) Microscopes

turn things that previously couldn't be seen into basic-level percepts, and

they do so in a consistent manner—which is good enough for most prac-

ticing scientists. Knowledge that we are confident of can grow because we

see science as having the potential to extend our basic-level perception

and manipulation very much further, perhaps indefinitely further. For an

extension of basic-level perception and manipulation to be acceptable,

standards of consistency, reliability, and (to a lesser extent) rational expla-

nation must be met. The microscope is consistent and reliable, so the fact

that we may not really know why it works is not so important—as long as

we think there is someone who knows or that someone will someday

know. But rationality helps in getting such extensions of basic-level per-

ception and manipulation accepted by the scientific community; under-

standing why something works is preferable.

It is the technological extension of basic-level perception and manipula-

tion that makes us confident that science provides us with real knowledge.

And if photographs aren't possible, graphs and diagrams are the next best

thing. And photographs that show patterns and shapes that are good

gestalts for us are more convincing than photographs that show patterns

and that don't fit our gestalt perception.

Take, for example, an NMR spectrometer (NMR = nuclear magnetic

?

resonance). A chemist can insert a substance and get an NMR spectro-

gram, which is in the form of a curve (a continuous function in

2-dimensional space). The shape of this curve is taken by chemists to be a

property of the substance—as much a property as its crystal configuration

and an even more fundamental and revealing property than its color. The

NMR spectrometer is thus taken as providing a basic-level understanding

of some aspect of electrochemical structure. It does this very indirectly, in

a way that is dependent on theoretical considerations of many sorts: the

theory of nuclear magnetic resonance, Fourier analysis, methods for

computing Fourier transforms, methods for displaying Fourier trans-

forms, etc. The result of all this is a curve that makes sense in terms of

basic-level perception. Because the curve is comprehensible, it can be

used to understand something about substances. And chemists intuitively

Knowledge 299
understand such curves as being properties of the substances—so much so that they refer to the spectrograms as "NMR spectra," as if the graph were the thing itself. The intervening theoretical assumptions on which NMR spectroscopy is based are taken as givens relative to the everyday functioning of the practicing chemist. NMR curves are used to understand substances and are taken as primary data for the purpose of theorizing. A substance's NMR structure is taken as something that is known about the substance, just as its color is. Within the knowledge structure of science, extended basic-level perceptions (such as curves on NMR spectrograms) are taken as primary data. And this is legitimized by their consistency and their regular relationship to other data within general physi-
cal and chemical theories.
The experientialist account of knowledge that we have given depends on our account of truth, which in turn depends on, among other things, the structure of our basic-level experience. Scientific "knowledge," and scientific understanding, to a large degree, depend on the technological extension of basic-level perception. Chemists take the NMR spectra of substances as known and understood via the curves on the NMR spectro-
grams.
This view of what we understand knowledge to be is very much in accord with the view of truth given above. Knowledge, like truth, depends on understanding, most centrally on our basic-level understanding of experience. For the most part, we take our basic-level perception to be unshakable (unless there is very good reason to believe otherwise). What
we perceive at the basic level is taken as real and known, pending very good reasons to the contrary. The same is true for scientific theories. They must be coherent with our basic-level perceptions and accepted by the relevant scientific communities in order to be generally accepted as true. Once they are, they become part of our knowledge—again pending good reasons to believe otherwise—because they provide the only so-
daily acceptable understanding available. In this respect, scientific
knowledge is like ordinary "knowledge."
Can knowledge ever be secure? Of course it can. Take our knowledge of the existence of cells. As we technologically extend our basic-level abilities to perceive and to manipulate, our understanding of organisms as being made up of cells remains unchallenged. It is stable and remains so because of the large number of observations of cell structure made through microscopes and the large number of manipulations of cell structure brought about through various technological extensions of our basic-level capacities. Our knowledge of the existence of cells seems secure, as secure as any knowledge is likely to be. Nonetheless, it is human knowledge based on human understanding, not on any neutral, or

Within the objectivist tradition, objectivity meant eliminating any aspects of the subjective so as to better see things from an objective, God's eye

Objectivism is often justified by the claim that it accounts for common

next to me. I pick up the apple and take a bite out of it. Common sense

tells us that there really was an apple there and I really did take a bite out

of it. This is what experientialism says, too. The apple and the table are

basic-level objects. By our best understanding of basic-level experience,

Being objective therefore requires:

basic-level spatial relation in our conceptual system, which is a gestalt consisting of a cluster of three kinesthetic image Schemas—one for above on a vertical axis, one for contact, and one for support. Given our best (and only) understanding of the situation, it is true that the apple is on the table. And it is not merely true, it is a central truth — a truth for which we are not likely to find a better understanding.
This story sounds a little like an objectivist story, and there is a good reason for it: our common sense folk theories are very largely objectivist folk theories. Our basic-level gestalt perception tells us that there are objects in the world. By looking more closely, we can distinguish aspects of the objects, which we understand as properties. Our kinesthetic image Schemas characterize relations between objects. And we naturally understand groups of objects in terms of our container-schemas: trees are in
forests. Thus, our common sense folk theory of categories is that they are

- knowing that one has a point of view, not merely a set of beliefs but a specific conceptual system in which beliefs are framed
- knowing what one's point of view is, including what one's conceptual system is like
- knowing other relevant points of view and being able to use the conceptual systems in which they are framed
- being able to assess a situation from other points of view, using other conceptual systems
- being able to distinguish concepts that are relatively stable and welldefined, given the general nature of the human organism and our environment (e.g., basic-level and image-schematic concepts), from those concepts that vary with human purposes and modes of indirect understanding

priate sort. The range of possibilities for relativism are discussed in the
following chapter.
The existence of directly meaningful concepts—basic-level concepts and image Schemas—provides certain fixed points in the objective evaluation of situations. The image-schematic structuring of bodily experience is, we hypothesize, the same for all human beings. Moreover, the principies determining basic-level structure are also universally valid, though
the particular concepts arrived at may differ somewhat. Thus, certain things will remain constant in assessing situations. Hunger and pain are basic-level, directly meaningful concepts. Water, wood, stone, and dirt are basic-level concepts, as are people, horses, cats, chairs, tables, and houses. And technology has provided ways of extending basic-level categorization, by extending the means for gestalt perception and for the
manipulation of objects.
Thus, it is not the case that anything goes in assessing a situation objectively. Basic-level and image-schematic understanding m the physical domain must be preserved. Directly meaningful concepts must be preserved if we are to assess any situation objectively. If our capacity for categorization and reason is based on our basic bodily functioning and on our purposes, then it follows that the preservation of our bodily functioning and the maximal freedom to pursue our purposes are basic human values. Relativism, as we shall see, does not mean giving up on either basic concepts or basic values. Instead, it means considering additional alternative possibilities for assessing situations using concepts that are not directly meaningful, for example, concepts that are understood via metaphor or concepts that are more abstract than basic-level concepts.
Above all, objectivity requires a proper understanding of human categorization, since one always assesses situations in terms of human categories. And human categorization, as we have seen, is based, in part, on the
nature of human bodies.

Summary

It is embodiment of the sort discussed above that makes the theory of

cognitive models more than a mere mentalistic theory. Meaningfulness

involves not merely mental structures, but the structuring of experience

itself. Some kinds of experiences are structured preconceptually because

of the way the world is and the way we are. We have suggested that at

least two forms of preconceptual structure exist: basic-level structure and

image-schematic structure. What is known about basic-level categoriza-

tion suggests the existence of basic-level preconceptual structure, which

'Il

arises as a result of our capacities for gestalt perception, mental imagery,

and motor movement. The consideration of certain gross patterns in our experience—our vertical orientation, the nature of our bodies as containers and as wholes with parts, our ability to sense hot and cold, our experience of being empty (hungry) as opposed to filled (satiated), etc.— suggests that our experience is structured kinesthetically in at least a gross way in a variety of experiential domains.
Cognitive models derive their fundamental meaningfulness directly from their ability to match up with preconceptual structure. Such direct matchings provide a basis for an account of truth and knowledge. Because such matching is "internal" to a person, the irreconcilable problems pointed out by Putnam in the case of objectivist theories do not arise in experientialist theories.
In domains where there is no clearly discernible preconceptual structure to our experience, we import such structure via metaphor. Metaphor provides us with a means for comprehending domains of experience that do not have a preconceptual structure of their own. A great many of our domains of experience are like this. Comprehending experience via metaphor is one of the great imaginative triumphs of the human mind. Much of rational thought involves the use of metaphoric models. Any adequate account of rationality must account for the use of imagination and much of imagination consists of metaphorical reasoning. Such an account is outside the realm of objectivist theories. (See Lakoff and Johnson 1980,

enterprise. Such a capacity would take preconceptual structures of experience as input and use them to motivate concepts that accord with those preconceptual structures. Such a capacity would explain (a) how we acquire our concepts, (ft) how concepts are linked to preconceptual structures, (c) why concepts have the peculiar properties they have, and (ri) how we can understand our present concepts and how we can come to understand even very different conceptual systems.

phor. Another example would be the word up, which can mean happy, in
"I'm feeling up today," or can have a spatial sense, in "The rocket went

These and other observations about prototypical uses of lexical items can be united with other data on natural categorization by viewing lexical items as constituting natural categories of senses. Thus some senses of a

In other cases, a single idealized cognitive model can be the basis on which a collection of senses forms a single natural category expressed by a single lexical item. Window is a good example. In our cognitive model of a window there is both an opening in the wall and a glass-filled frame fitting into it. This correspondence provides motivation for using the same word to refer to both. In isolation, an opening in the wall doesn't have much if anything in common with a glass-filled frame. Independent of any knowledge about the way windows happen to work, there would be no objective reason to place these two very different kinds of things in the same category. The fact that the opening in the wall and the glass-filled frame have been brought together to fit one another physically and to correspond to one another in the same cognitive model seems to make them members of the same cognitive category—so much so that in sentences like the following the word window doesn't seem to distinguish between

- This room is too dark; we're going to have to cut a new window in that
wall.
- They've just delivered our new windows.
Window can also refer to the frame alone or the glass alone:
-This window has rotted; we're going to have to replace it. -The kids were playing ball and broke a window.
In the case of window the correspondences are physical: the glass fitting the frame, the frame fitting the opening in the wall. These correspondences within our model of what a window is motivate our use of the
word window in these three senses, and in addition allow us to view these
three senses (opening, frame, and glass) not as unrelated, but as forming a natural category of senses. The idea that lexical items are natural categories of senses has been studied extensively in the domain of English prepositions, and we will turn to those results next.
Chaining within Categories: The Case of Over
Most of the research on categorization within cognitive psychology has been in the domain of physical objects and physical perception. But perhaps the strongest evidence against traditional views of categorization and in favor of a prototype approach comes from the study of verbparticles and prepositions. The most detailed studies of prepositions by far are those done by Lindner (1981) and Brugman (1981). Lindner's study looked at more than 1800 verb-particle constructions using the two words up and out and surveyed the contributions to meaning made by the particles. Brugman's study is an extended survey of the highly complex network of senses of the English word over. It covers nearly one hundred kinds of uses. The two studies reach substantially the same conclusions, though Brugman's has a more thorough discussion of the consequences for the theory of categorization, and she is the first to explicitly propose the idea that lexical items are natural categories of senses. This case study presents part of that analysis and extends it in two ways: first, in showing the precise relations among the spatial senses and second, in describing metaphorical extensions of the spatial senses.
The Problem
To get some sense of the problem, let us consider a handful of the senses
of over:
- The painting is over the mantle. - The plane is flying over the hill.

Chaining within Categories: The Case of Over 419
- Sam is walking over the hill.
- Sam lives over the hill. - The wall fell over.
- Sam turned the page over.
- Sam turned over.
- She spread the tablecloth over the table. - The guards were posted all over the hill. - The play is over. - Do it over, but don't overdo it.
- Look over my corrections, and don't overlook any of them.
- You made over a hundred errors.
Even this small number of examples shows enormous complexity. Not all the complexity is semantic; the word over in these examples is in several grammatical categories, e.g., preposition, particle, adverb, prefix, etc.
The problem Brugman undertook was how to describe all these senses
and the relations among them. The analysis we will be presenting is a minor refinement of the semantic aspect of Brugman's analysis. Let us begin
with what Brugman found to be the central sense.
The Above-Across Sense The central sense of over combines elements of both above and across. In
figure 1, the plane is understood as a trajector (TR) oriented relative to a
landmark (LM). TR and LM are generalizations of the concepts figure

and ground (Langacker 1986). In this case the landmark is unspecified. The arrow in the figure represents the PATH that the TR is moving along.
The LM is what the plane is flying over. The PATH is above the LM. The dotted lines indicate the extreme boundaries of the landmark. The PATH goes all the way across the landmark from the boundary on one side to the boundary on the other. Although the drawing in figure 1 indicates noncontact between the TR and LM, this sense is actually neutral on the issue of contact. As we will see shortly, there are instances with contact and in-

t

420 Case Study 2

stances without contact. In this respect the schema cannot be drawn cor-

rectly. Any drawing would have to indicate contact or the lack of it. The

image schema is neutral and that is part of what makes it schematic. What

we have here is an abstract schema that cannot itself be imaged con-

cretely, but which structures images. We will return below to the question

of what it means for an image schema to structure an image.

Let us now turn to some special cases of the schema in figure 1. These

are instances of the schema that are arrived at by adding information, in

particular, by further specifying the nature of the landmark and by speci-

fying whether or not there is contact. We will consider four kinds of land-

mark specifications: (1) LM is a point, that is, the landmark is an entity

whose internal structure is irrelevant as far as the schema is concerned.

(2) LM is extended, that is, the landmark extends over a distance or area.

s

(3) LM is vertical, in that it extends upward (for example, a fence or a

hill). (4) LM is both extended and vertical. For each such case, we will

consider two further specifications: contact between TR and LM and non-

contact. Each schema will be named using the following abbreviations:

X, extended; V, vertical; C, contact; NC, no contact. Thus, the schema

name l.VX.C stands for the special case of schema 1 in which the land-

mark is both vertical and extended (VX) and there is contact (C) between

the LM and the TR. The Schemas in figures 2-7 can be related by a dia-

gram of the sort shown in figure 8, where the links among Schemas indi-

cate similarity. Thus, all the contact Schemas are linked, as are all the

Schemas that share noncontact. Moreover, each pair of Schemas that

share everything except contact are linked. In addition, they are all

linked to schema 1, since they are all instances of that schema.

The Schemas in figures 2-7 can be viewed in two ways. Take, for exam-

pie, a sentence like Sam walked over the hill in figure 6. We can think of

^1

over in this sentence as being represented by the minimally specified

schema 1 of figure 1, and we can think of the additional information as being

t.

added by the object and the verb. Thus, a hill is vertical and extended

(VX) and walking requires contact (C) with the ground. Let us refer to

this as the minimal specification interpretation. Equivalently, we can view

the minimally specified over of figure 1 as generating all the fully specified

Schemas of figures 2-7. On this full specification interpretation, we can

think of the over in 5am walked over the hill as having the full specification

of schema l.VX.C in figure 6. The verb walk would then match the con-

tact (C) specification, and the direct object hill would match the vertical

extended (VX) specification. The difference is whether the verb and di-

rect object add the VX and C information or whether they match it.

These two interpretations make slightly different claims about the lexi-

cal representation of over in these sentences. On the minimal specifica-

Consider the following case, where there is a focus on the end point of the path. We will use the abbreviation E in naming Schemas where there is end-point focus. In figure 10, there is an understood path that goes over the hill, and Sam lives at the end of that path. The end-point focus is not added by anything in the sentence, neither hill, nor lives, nor Sam. Here over has an additional sense which is one step away from schema l.VX.C,
a sense in which end-point focus (E) is added to yield schema l.VX.C.E.
As we shall see below, such end-point focus senses are the result of a general process that applies in many, but not all, English prepositions.
End-point focus cannot be freely added to just any of the Schemas in figures 2-7. It can only be added to those with an extended landmark, as in

tion interpretation, only schema 1 exists in the lexicon; the other Schemas all result from information added by the verb and direct object. On the full specification interpretation, there is a lexical representation for all
these Schemas; the more specific Schemas are generated by schema 1 plus
the general parameters we have discussed: C-NC and X-VX-V.
On the basis of what we have said so far, these two interpretations are
completely equivalent; there is no empirical difference between them and
no a priori reason to choose between them. There is, however, additional
evidence that favors the full specification interpretation, and we will be citing it throughout the remainder of this case study. We will be arguing
that the senses of over form a chain with schema 1 at the center. On the
full specification interpretation, the Schemas in figures 2-7 are part of that
chain. Some of those Schemas form links to other senses. The existence of
such links suggests that the full specification interpretation is correct.

figure 11. In these cases, over has the sense of "on the other side of" as a
result of end-point focus. However, over does not in general mean "on the other side of." For example, sentences like Sam lives over the wall and Sam. is standing over the door, if they occur at all, cannot mean that he lives or is standing on the other side of the wall and the door. And a sentence like Sam is sitting over the spot, can only mean that he is sitting on it,
not that he is sitting on the other side of it. Thus, there is no end-point focus schema corresponding to schema l.V.C. of figure 7. Assuming the full specification interpretation, we can extend the chain in figure 8 to include
the Schemas in figures 10 and 11.

So far, we have considered two types of links among Schemas: instance links and similarity links. Here are two examples, where -> indicates an instance link and <^ indicates a similarity link:
Instance link: I.V. C. ^ 1
Similarity links: l.VX.NC ^ l.VX.C
Thus, the link between schema 1 and schema l.V.C is an instance link,
with 1. V. C being an instance of 1. And the link between schema l.VX.NC and schema l.VX.C is a similarity link, where l.VX is shared.

Schema 2
So far, we have looked only at instances of the above-across sense. And we have only looked at the least interesting links between Schemas. Let us now turn to other senses and more interesting kinds of links.
The Above Sense
Over has a stative sense, with no PATH. It is roughly equivalent in meaning to above. Schema 2 has no particular constraints on either the TR or LM. It is linked to schema 1 in that it has the TR above the LM. However, it differs from schema 1 in two respects: First, it has no PATH and no boundaries; in other words, the across sense is missing. Second, it does not permit contact between the TR and LM. The no-contact requirement can be seen in examples like The helicopter is hovering over the hill. If the helicopter lands, it is no longer over the hill, it is on the hill.
From time to time, linguists have suggested that schema 2 is the core meaning of the preposition over, that is, that schema 2 is present in all the uses of over as a preposition. It should be clear from what we have seen so far that this is false. Since schema 2 requires no contact, it cannot be present in those cases where contact occurs, for example, in schema l.X.C exemplified by 5am drove over the bridge. Schema 2 also does not occur in the cases of end-point focus, such as schema l.VX.C.E, which is exemplified by Sam. lives over the hill. In this case, the TR is not above the LM.
One of the instances of schema 2 is the case where the TR is one-
dimensional (which we will abbreviate as 1DTR). This schema is a minimal variant of schema 1 .X.NC, exemplified by The bird flew over the yard, as shown in figure 2. The extended path in figure 2 corresponds to the one-dimensional solid trajector in figure 14. We will call this kind of link between Schemas a transformational link. This particular link between an
extended path (X.P) and a one-dimensional trajector (1DTR) will be rep-
resented as:
X.P ^ 1DTR

This relationship is not directly reflected in the naming system for Schemas that we have adopted. However, we can state the relationship more sys-

tematically if we do a little renaming of a sort that reflects image-schema

decompositions. Let us use AB V for the above subschema. And let us use

PATH (P) for the across subschema. Schema 1 would be renamed ABV.P,

and Schema l.X.NC of figure 2 would be renamed ABV.NC.X.P. This

name would reflect the fact that in this schema the TR is moving above

between schema 2 and schema 3. In schema 2 the dimensionality of the trajector is unspecified, while in schema 3 it must be at least two-dimensional. But whereas schema 2 requires noncontact, schema 3 is neutral with respect to contact, allowing either contact or lack of it.
There is a minimal variant of schema 3 in which the TR moves into the
configuration of schema 3. This schema is composed of schema 3 plus a path (P) indicating motion to the final position. Schema 3. P. E is linked to
schema 1. It shares motion of the TR above and across the LM. It also
shares a lack of specification for contact. Schema 3. P. E differs from schema 1 in two ways. It is specified for the dimension of the trajector and

It is important to bear in mind the difference between similarity links

and transformational links. In the case of similarity links, the link is

defined by shared subschemas. In the relationship described above, there are, indeed, shared subschemas: both Schemas contain ABV.NC. But the

There is a group of Schemas for over that have to do with covering. This group is linked to the grid of figure 15 in two ways. The basic covering schema is a variant of schema 2, where the TR is at least two-dimensional
and extends across the boundaries of the LM. There are two differences

There are two covering Schemas in which over is paired with a mass quantifier that quantifies regions of the landmark, e.g., all, most, a lot of,

the points representing the multiplex entity of 3.MX are joined to form a path (P) which "covers" the landmark. Examples are:

entire, etc. The quantifier all may combine with over in this sense to form the unit all over. The first of these two Schemas has a multiplex (MX) trajector, that is, a trajector made up of many individuals.

- I walked all over the hill. - We've hiked over most of the Sierras.
- I've hitchhiked over the entire country.

- He has freckles over most of his body.

- There are specks of paint all over the rug.

I.

- There is sagebrush over the entire valley floor.

We can represent this schema in figure 19. This schema is linked to schema 3. MX by an image transformation that forms a path through a collection of points. We will represent this transformational linkage as:

In these cases, the individuals—the individual hairs, specks of paint, and bushes—don't completely cover the part of the landmark quantified by over. Rather, the landmark has small regions which jointly cover its surface (or most of it), and there is at least one trajector in each region. The

tween a continuous region (or mass) and a multiplex entity. Such rela-

tionship between multiplex entities and masses is a natural visual rela-

tionship. Imagine a large herd of cows up close—close enough to pick out

the individual cows. Now imagine yourself moving back until you can no

longer pick out the individual cows. What you perceive is a mass. There is

a point at which you cease making out the individuals and start perceiving

a mass. It is this perceptual experience upon which the relationship be-

tween multiplex entities and masses rests. The image transformation that

relates multiplex entities and masses characterizes the link between

schema 3 and schema 3.MX. We can characterize that transformational

link as follows:

MX ^ MS

There is a second covering schema for over in which over is associated with a mass quantifier. It is a minimal variant on schema 3. MX in which

The covering Schemas all have variants in which the TR need not be above (that is, higher than) the LM. In all cases, however, there must be
an understood viewpoint from which the TR is blocking accessibility of vision to at least some part of the landmark.
- There was a veil over her face.
- As the rain came down, it froze and ice spread all over the windshield. - There were flies all over the ceiling. - The spider had crawled all over the ceiling.
We will refer to these as rotated (RO) Schemas, though with no suggestion that there is actual mental rotation degree-by-degree involved. One might suggest that instead of rotation from the vertical, there is simply a lack of specification of orientation. If there were, we would expect that the contact restrictions would be the same in all orientations, but they are not. The rotated versions of the MX Schemas (3. MX and 3. MX. P) re-

f

quire contact, while the unrotated versions do not. Here are some typical examples that illustrate the distinction:

- Superman flew all over downtown Metropolis. (TR above LM, noncontact)
- * Superman flew all over the canyon walls. (TR not above LM, noncontact)
- Harry climbed all over the canyon walls. (TR not above LM, contact)

1/

Thus, Superman's flying alongside the canyon walls does not constitute

flying over them.

We will add RO to the names of the unrotated covering Schemas to

yield names for the corresponding covering Schemas. The rotated cover-

ing Schemas have the following names: 3.RO, 3.P.RO, 3.MX.RO, and

3.MX.P.RO. Figure 20 is a diagram indicating the links among the cover-

ing Schemas and the links to the other over Schemas. And figure 21 indi-

cates the overall linkage among the Schemas discussed so far.

The Reflexive Schemas
Perhaps the most remarkable of the discoveries made by Lindner (1981, 1982) was the discovery of reflexive trajectors. The concept can be illustrated most simply using the example of out. The simplest use of out occurs in cases like Harry ran out of the room. In figure 22 the container (the room) is the landmark, and the trajector (Harry) moves from the interior to the exterior of the room. But this schema won't do for cases of out like:
- The syrup spread out. - The posse spread out.

- They stretched out the taffy. - We rolled out the carpet.

Here the relevant trajectors are the syrup, the posse, the taffy, and the carpet. But they are not moving out with respect to any other landmark. Take the case of the syrup. Pour some syrup on a table. It will have a certain outer boundary at first. But the boundary moves. Some of the syrup that was inside the initial boundary is now outside that initial boundary. The syrup, or at least part of it, is moving "out" relative to its own prior boundary. We can schematize this as in figure 23. In short, the syrup is its
own landmark. TR = LM. Such a relation between a landmark and a tra-
jector is called reflexive. Since there is only one entity under consider-
ation, it is referred to as a reflexive trajector.

The equal sign in "TR = LM" is not strict identity; it is "identity" of part
of a bounded mass relative to itself as it used to be bounded. As we will see below, there are several ways in which "TR = LM" can be realized. An
important one is when parts of a single entity act as TR and other parts of the same entity act as LM. This kind of reflexive trajector occurs in the case of over. Consider examples like:
- Roll the log over.
Here a major part (roughly half) of the log is moving above and across the rest. That is, half the log is acting as landmark and the rest as trajector.
The same is true in a case like
- Turn the paper over.
Both of these are variations on schema 1; they differ only in that LM = TR
in the sense just described.
We can represent the schema for these cases in figure 24. Schema 4 can be viewed as a transform of schema 1, with schema 4 adding the condition TR = LM. We will represent such a transformational link äs
NRF ^ RF
where NRF means nonreflexive and RF means reflexive. If we had chosen
to name schema 4 according to its status as a variant of schema 1, we
would have called it l.RF.
The path of over in schema 4 traces a semicircle above and across other
parts of the thing being moved. We will refer to this as a reflexive path.

There is a variant on schema 4 in which no part of the thing moving moves above or across any other part; instead, the entity as a whole traces the reflexive path:
- The fence fell over. - Sam knocked over the lamp.
These are cases where the TR is initially vertical and moves so as to follow the last half of a reflexive path (RFP). The relationship between Schemas 4 and 4.RFP (fig. 25) can be stated as follows: In schema 4, half of the TR follows the whole reflexive path; in schema 4.RPF, all of the TR follows the last half of the reflexive path.
This schema is not only a variant of schema 4. It is also a minimal vari-
ant of one of the most common instances of schema 1, the instance that
characterizes over in The dog jumped over the fence. In this case, there is a vertical landmark and the path of the trajector both begins and ends on
the ground (G). This results in a semicircular path, as in figure 26. If we
take the reflexive transform of this schema, letting TR = LM, we get the schema of figure 25, schema 4.RFP. Thus, schema 4.RFP has close links
to two other Schemas.
The Excess Schema
When over is used as a prefix, it can indicate excess, as in:
- The bathtub overflowed.
-1 overate.
- Don't overextend yourself.

Overflow provides a link between the excess schema in general and the schema of figure 26. For overflowing to take place, there must be a fluid in a container, which has vertical sides. The path of the overflowing fluid is upward and over the side of the container. This makes the over of overflow an instance of figure 26, where the LM = the side of the container, the
PATH = the path of the flow, and the TR = the level of the fluid.
But overflowing is more than just flowing over the edge of a container. Semantically, it involves excess. Syntactically, the over becomes a prefix. Let us look at the semantics first. The concept of overflowing presupposes that there is a container with vertical sides and that the height of the sides characterizes the maximal normal amount of fluid, relative to some assumed norm. For example,
- The river overflowed.
Here the banks of the river are the vertical sides and define the maximal
normal height of the river. Thus, we have in addition: the height of the LM defines the maximal normal amount of fluid. Thus, flowing over the
LM constitutes exceeding the norm.
We regularly fill containers with fluids for some purpose, drinking,
washing, etc. The container used defines a maximal normal amount of the
fluid. Overflowing is a very common occurrence. When it occurs, the fluid put into the container is wasted and creates a mess. This regular correlation in experience is the basis of the metaphor on which the excess schema is based. The metaphor involved is not specialized to the excess schema; it is more general. In the metaphor, AN ACTIVITY is A CONTAINER for the effort (or energy) put into it. The sides of the container define the maximal normal effort required to achieve the goal of the activity. Overdoing something involves putting more than the maximal normal amount of effort into an activity that is required to achieve the goal. This results in wasted effort, and sometimes in awkwardness (a social mess).
The excess schema is thus not merely an image schema, but an image schema (l.V.NC.G as in fig. 25) plus a metaphor. We will refer to it as

Chaining within Categories: The Case of Over 435
The Repetition Schema
One of the most common uses of over is to indicate repetition, as in
- Do it over.
Here over is used as an adverb. As in the case of the over of excess, the
over of repetition makes use of a complex schema built on an instance of schema 1, namely, schema l.X.C. This schema has an extended landmark and indicates motion above and across it (cf. fig. 5). The repetition schema uses schema l.X.C and adds two metaphors to it. Again, the path is metaphorically understood as the course of the activity. This is via the very general ACTIVITY is A JOURNEY metaphor. There is, however, an important idiosyncrasy in this sense: the landmark is understood metaphorically as an earlier completed performance of the activity. This is a special-purpose constraint on the general metaphor, which is, to my knowledge, used only in this complex schema. This is the part of the repe-
tition schema for over that is not motivated by an occurrence elsewhere in
the conceptual system. For this reason, the repetition sense of over is less naturally tied into the category of senses than the other senses.
At this point, we are in a position to give a link diagram that shows a good deal of the complexity of over. In that diagram, we will refer to the repetition schema as schema 6. Figure 27 displays all the links we have discussed so far. A number of additional metaphorical links will be dis-
cussed below.
Figure 27 shows what is meant by a radial structure. Schema 1 occupies a central position; it and its instances are of primary importance in the system of links. The links correspond to what Wittgenstein called "family
resemblances." The links are sometimes defined by shared properties, but
frequently they are defined not by shared properties, but by transforms or
by metaphors.
Some Metaphorical Senses
It is extremely common for metaphors to take image Schemas as their in-
put. A great many metaphorical models use a spatial domain as their source domain. Among the most common source domains for metaphorical models are containers, orientations, journeys (with paths and goals), vertical impediments, etc. In this section, we will give a number of cases where over has a metaphorical sense based on an image schema discussed
above.
- She has a strange power over me.
This is an instance of a very common metaphor: CONTROL is UP; LACK OF

one: CHOOSING is TOUCHING. This occurs in such sentences as He was

Fig. 27. Relations among the Schemas

tence is an extension of schema 2 (fig. 14), where the trajector is simply
above the landmark.

The over in overlook is based on schema 2.1DTR (fig. 14). There are two metaphors involved. The first is a metaphor for understanding vision: SEEING is TOUCHING. This occurs in examples like / couldn't take my eyes off of her, Her eyes picked out every detail of the pattern, He undressed her with his eyes, and He fixed his gaze on the entrance. According to this metaphor, one's gaze goes from one's eyes to what one sees. You see whatever your gaze touches. Under the metaphorical mapping, the path in schema 2.1DTR is the gaze. Since there is no contact in schema 2.1DTR, the metaphorical gaze doesn't touch the landmark; thus the subject of overlook is not looking at, and therefore does not see, the landmark. The second metaphor is the general MIND-AS-BODY metaphor (cf. Sweetser 1984). The relevant aspect of that metaphor is the part in which LOOKING AT SOMETHING IS TAKING IT INTO CONSIDERATION. Accordingly, I'll take a look at it normally entails I'll consider it. Therefore, to overlook someone's accomplishments is not to take them into consideration.
The over in oversee is based on schema 2 (fig. 13), in which the TR is above the LM. There are a metaphor and a metonymy that are relevant to this example. The metaphor is CONTROL is UP. Thus, the one who does the overseeing has control over the persons overseen. The metonymy is SEE-
ING SOMETHING DONE STANDS FOR MAKING SURE THAT IT IS DONE. This
metonymy is based on an idealized model in which making sure of something typically involves seeing it. Because of this metonymic relation, See that he gets his money means Make sure that he gets his money. Thus, to oversee means to be in control and make sure that something is done.
We can now compare overlook to look over.
- Look over my corrections, but don't overlook any of them.

- Sam was passed over for promotion.
Here we have an instance of schema 1 (fig. 1). Two metaphorical mappings apply to it. The first is CONTROL is UP; LACK OF CONTROL is DOWN. This entails that the person who passed over Sam was in control of Sam's status. The second metaphor that applies to this schema is another common

The over in too/r over is based on schema 3.MX.P (fig. 19), and the SEEING is TOUCHING metaphor. The resulting complex schema is one in which the subject's gaze traces a path that "covers" the direct object, corrections. In the resulting schema, the gaze does make contact with the landmark. The MIND-AS-BODY metaphor again yields a sense of look in which looking at something involves taking it into consideration. Thus, when one looks

438 Case Study 2
over X, one directs one's attention to a representative sampling that"covers" X, and one takes into consideration each subpart that one directs at-
tention to.

Motivation

Before we go on, it is worth commenting on what is and what is not being

explained in these analyses. We are not explaining why oversee, overlook,

and look over mean what they mean. Their meanings cannot be predicted
from the meanings of over, look, and see. But their meanings are not

l:!i

completely arbitrary. Given the range of spatial meanings of over and

given the metaphors present in the conceptual system that English is

based on, it makes sense for these words to have these meanings. We are

explaining just why it makes sense and what kind of sense it makes.

1.1

In each of these cases, the metaphorical and metonymic models exist in

the conceptual system independently of the given expression. For exam-

pie, we understand seeing metaphorically in terms of a gaze that goes out

of one's eyes and touches the object seen. This metaphorical understand-

ing is present regardless of whether any of the expressions just discussed

have those meanings. Similarly, the Schemas for over exist for expressions

in the spatial domain independent of the existence of oversee, overlook,

and look over. What one learns when one learns these words is which of

the independently existing components of their meaning are actually utilized. Each of these expressions is a specialized "assembly" of independently existing parts. The only arbitrariness involved is the knowledge

I

that such an assembly exists.

The psychological claim being made here is that it is easier to learn, re-

member, and use such assemblies which use existing patterns than it is to

learn, remember, and use words whose meaning is not consistent with ex-

isting patterns. What is being explained is not why those expressions

mean what they mean, but why those are natural meanings for them to have. Thus, if one is going to have a word that means "to fail to take into

consideration," it is more natural to use overlook than to use an existing unrelated word like sew, or a complex word whose components are in conflict with the meaning, such as underplan, or taste at, or rekick. It is

common sense that such expressions would not be used with such a mean-

ing, and we are characterizing the nature of that "common sense."

As we have mentioned before, such an explanation requires going be-
yond the predictable-arbitrary dichotomy. It requires introducing the

concept of motivation. Thus, the meaning of overlook, though not predictable, is motivated—motivated by one of the spatial Schemas for over

and by two metaphors in the conceptual system. Similarly, all of the

Chaining within Categories: The Case of Over 439
noncentral Schemas for over in the chain given in figure 27 are
motivated—motivated by other senses and by principles of linking.
More Metaphorical Senses
There are some additional common metaphorical senses of over that are worth discussing. Take get over, for example.
- Harry still hasn't gotten over his divorce.
This use of over is based on schema l.VX.C (fig. 6) and two metaphors. In
the first metaphor, obstacles are understood in terms of vertical landmarks—which may be extended or not. This metaphorical model is the basis for expressions such as There is nothing standing in your way. The second metaphorical model is one that understands LIFE as a JOURNEY. This occurs in sentences like It's time to get on with your life. In the above use, the divorce is an obstacle (metaphorically, a vertical extended landmark) on the path defined by life's journey.
- Pete Rose is over the hill.
Over the hill makes use of schema l.VX.C.E (fig. 10) and a metaphor for understanding a career in terms of a journey over a vertical extended landmark like a hill. In this metaphorical model of a career, one starts at the bottom, may go all the way to the top, and then goes downhill. Thus, over the hill means that one has already reached and passed the peak, or "high point," of one's career and will never have that high a stature again.
- The rebels overthrew the government.
This is an instance of schema 4.RFP (fig. 25) which is the schema m fall over, and the CONTROL is UP metaphor. Before the event takes place, the government is in control (metaphorically upright), and afterwards it is not in control (metaphorically, it has fallen over).
- He turned the question over in his mind.
This is an instance of schema 4 (fig. 24), plus an instance of the MIND-ASBODY metaphor in which THINKING ABOUT SOMETHING is EXAMINING IT. This metaphorical model occurs in such sentences as Let us now examine the question of factory chickens. In examining a physical object, one turns it over in order to get a look at all sides of it. Questions are metaphorically understood as having sides, and when one turns a question over in one's
mind, one is examining all sides of it.
- The play is over.
Here we have an instance of schema l.X.C.E (fig. 11). In general, activi-

440 Case Study 2
ties with a prescribed structure are understood as extended landmarks, and performing such an activity is understood metaphorically as traveling along a prescribed path over that landmark. When one gets to the end, the activity is over. Thus, games, plays, and political campaigns can be
characterized at their end as being over.
Image Schemas as Links between Perception and Reason
Two of our major sources of information are vision and language. We can gain information through either perceiving something directly or being told it. And we can reason about that information, no matter what its source. We can even reason using information from both sources simultaneously, which suggests that it is possible for us to encode information from both sources in a single format. I would like to suggest that image Schemas provide such a format.
It is my guess that image Schemas play a central role in both perception
and reason. I believe that they structure our perceptions and that their structure is made use of in reason. The analysis of over that we have just given is rich enough for us to discuss such questions in some detail. Let us
begin with the following question. Are the image-schema transforma-
tions we have discussed natural, and if so, what is the source of their
"naturalness"?
The Nature of Image-Schema Transformations
There are certain very natural relationships among image-schemas, and these motivate polysemy, not just in one or two cases, but in case after case throughout the lexicon. Natural image-schema transformations play a central role in forming radial categories of senses. Take, for example, the end-point focus transformation. It is common for words that have an image schema with a path to also have the corresponding image-schema with a focus on the end point of the path, as Bennett (1975) observed. We
saw this in over in cases like
-Sam walked over the hill. (path)
- Sam lives over the hill. (end of path)
Pairs such as this are common.
- Harry walked through that doorway, (path) - The passport office is through that doorway, (end of path)
- Sam walked around the corner, (path) - Sam lives around the corner, (end of path)
- Harriet walked across the street, (path) - Harriet lives across the street, (end of path)

Chaining within Categories: The Case of Over 441
- Mary walked down the road. (path) - Mary lives down the road. (end of path) - Sam walked past the post office, (path) - Sam lives past the post office, (end of path)
It should be noted that although such pairs are common, they are not fully
productive.
- Sam walked by the post office, (path) - Sam lives by the post office. (= near; + end of path)
Here, by has a path schema, but no corresponding end-point schema.
- Sam ran from the house, (path) - Sam stood three feet from the house, (end of path) - Sam ran to the house, (path) - *Sam stood (three feet) to the house, (not end of path)
From allows both path and end-of-path Schemas, but to allows only a path
schema.
Path Schemas are so naturally related to end-point Schemas that people
sometimes have to think twice to notice the difference. The same is true
of the schema transformation that links multiplex and mass Schemas. It is natural for words that have a mass schema to have a multiplex schema as
well.
- All men are mortal. (MX) - All gold is yellow. (MS) - She bought a lot o/earrings. (MX) - She bought a lot o/jewelry. (MS)
This schema transformation, of course, doesn't hold for all quantifiers:
- She bought two earrings. (MX) - * She bought two jewelry. (MS)
There are also verbs that have both Schemas:
- He poured the juice through the sieve. (MS) - The fans poured through the gates (MX)
This will also work for other verbs of liquid movement, such as spill, flow,
etc.
- The wine spilled out over the table. (MS) - The fans spilled out over the field. (MX)
There is a special case of the multiplex-mass transformation in which the

442 Case Study 2
multiplex entity is a sequence of points and the mass is a one-dimensional trajector. A variety of prepositions permit both Schemas.
- There are guards posted along the road. (MX) - There is a fence along the road. (1DTR)
- He coughed throughout the concert. (MX) - He slept throughout the concert. (1DTR) - There were stains down his tie. (MX) - There were stripes down his tie. (1DTR)
There is a natural relationship not only between a one-dimensional trajector and a sequence of points, but also between a one-dimensional trajector and a zero-dimensional moving trajector that traces a path.
- Sam went to the top of the mountain. (ODMTR) - The road went to the top of the mountain. (1DTR) - Sam ran through the forest. (ODMTR) - There is a road through the forest. (1DTR) - Sam walked across the street. (ODMTR) - There was a rope stretched across the street. (1DTR)
Finally, there is a natural relationship between nonreflexive and reflexive trajectors. Here are some examples:
- He stood apart from the crowd. (NRF) - The book fell apart. (RF) - She walked up to me. (NRF) - Let's cuddle up. (RF) - She poured the syrup out of the jar. (NRF) - The syrup spread out over the pancakes. (RF)
Let us consider for a moment what is natural about these image-schema
transformations.
Path focus <^ end-point focus: It is a common experience to follow the path of a moving object until it comes to rest, and then to focus on where it is. This corresponds to the path focus and end-point focus transforma-
tion.
Multiplex <-> mass: As one moves further away, a group of individuals at a certain point begins to be seen as a mass. Similarly, a sequence of points is
seen as a continuous line when viewed from a distance.
ODMTR <-> 1DTR: When we perceive a continuously moving object, we can mentally trace the path it is following. This capacity is reflected in the

Chaining within Categories: The Case of Over 443
transformation linking zero-dimensional moving trajectors and a onedimensional trajector.
NRF <-> RF: Given a perceived relationship between a TR and a LM which are two separate entities, it is possible to perceive the same relationship between (a) different parts of the same entity or (o) earlier and later locations of the same entity, where one part or location is considered LM and the other TR.
In short, these schema transformations are anything but arbitrary. They are direct reflections of our experiences, which may be visual, or kines-
thetic.
The fact that image Schemas are a reflection of our sensory and general spatial experience is hardly surprising, yet it plays a very important role in the theory of image Schemas. Perhaps we can see that significance most easily by contrasting the image-schema transformations we have described with the names we have given to them. Take the transformation name "MX ^ MS." The names "MX" and "MS" are arbitrary relative to the character of what they name: a group of individual entities and a mass. The transformation is a natural relationship, but the name of the transformation is just a bunch of arbitrary symbols.
The distinction is important because of certain versions of the computational theory of mind. On one theory of image representation—the "propositional theory"—visual scenes are represented by arbitrary symbols which are linked together in network structures. Arbitrary symbols such as X and Y are taken as standing for some aspect of a scene, such as a point or an edge or a surface or an entire object. Other symbols are used to express relations among these symbols, for example, "ABV(X,Y)" and "C(X,Y)" might represent relations which are supposed to correspond to "X is above Y" and "X is in contact with Y," but which, so far as the computer is concerned, are just symbols. Such a symbolization describes how various parts—points, edges, surfaces, etc.—are related to one another. Objects in a scene are described using such symbolizations.
According to the computational view of mind as applied to visual information and mental imagery (Pylyshyn 1981), only such propositional representations are mentally real, while images are not real. This view stems from taking the computational model of the mind very seriously. Since digital computers work by the manipulation of such arbitrary symbols, the strong version of the computational theory of mind requires not only that visual perception and mental imagery be characterizable in such a "propositional" form, but also that such symbolic representations, and only those, are mentally real.

444 Case Study 2
The names that we have given to image Schemas, and to image-schema transformations, are very much in keeping with the kind of symbolization that might be used in studies of computer vision. But the names are not the things named. This is shown by the naturalness of image-schema transformations relative to visual experience, as opposed to the arbitrariness of the names for those transformations. It seems to me that imageschema transformations are cognitively real; the pervasiveness of the kinds of relationships between senses of lexical items that those transformations characterize is a strong indicator of their cognitive reality. And the naturalness of these transformations relative to our visual experience suggests that image-schema transformations and the Schemas they relate
are not propositional in character (in the sense of the term used in computer vision studies). Rather, they are truly imagisfic in character.
Perceptions, Rich Images, and Schemas
The term image is not intended here to be limited to visual images. We also have auditory images, olfactory images, and images of how forces act upon us. But the only kind of nonvisual images that linguists have said anything of interest about are sound images (Rhodes and Lawler 1981, McCune 1983) and force images (Talmy 1985&). Sweetser (1982, 1984) has demonstrated that our image-schematic understanding of forces lies behind our understanding of modality, that is, the concepts represented
by words such as must, may, can, etc. But, on the whole, research on image Schemas has concentrated on visual images, and we will limit our dis-
cussion to those.
It is important at the outset to distinguish mental images from perceptions. A perception of a scene is rich in detail; every part of the visual field
is filled. And one can focus on details that are very small and intricate. Moreover, since our eyes are constantly scanning different parts of the visual field, the details focused on are continually changing. We perceive in color, and we can perceive an incredible range of shades of color. Those of us with color vision cannot simply turn off the color. Moreover, we ordinarily perceive without noticeable effort, although paying attention and noticing is an effortful activity.
Mental images have a different character. They are not nearly as detailed as perceptions, and they do not allow anything like the full range of perceived colors. People who see in color can have mental images in black and white. Not all of the field of mental vision is filled. And although in daydreaming we form mental images without noticeable effort, constructing an image and keeping it in mind is an effortful activity. More-
over, we can form images of things we can't see. Imagine a basketball.

Chaining within Categories: The Case of Over 445
Imagine a trunk. Imagine the basketball inside the trunk. Our real eyes cannot see through the trunk to the basketball, but our mind's eye can.
Conscious Effortful Imagery
The study of mental images has recently come into its own in cognitive
psychology, due primarily to the efforts of Roger Shepard, Stephen Kosslyn, and their co-workers (cf. Shepard and Cooper 1982, Kosslyn 1980, 1983). Shepard and his colleagues have studied rigid transformations of images, e.g., rotations, which unlike the schema transformations mentioned above, are structure-preserving. Kosslyn and his co-workers have studied such matters as what is involved in scanning images, putting parts of images together, and even how wide the field of "mental vi-
sion" is.
The kind of mental images studied by Shepard, Kosslyn, and others are what we will call context-bound specific conscious effortful rich images. Subjects are presented with pictures and are asked to form images of them. This makes the images context-bound. They are then asked to do such things as rotate them in their minds or scan them or make judgments about them. The images are specific in that the pictures presented are of specific objects or figures. They are conscious in that subjects form the images consciously and do conscious manipulations on them. The fact that it requires some mental effort for subjects to construct and manipulate the images makes them effortful. And the images are relatively rich in detail compared to the Schemas that we have been discussing. They are the sort of images you would get if I showed you a detailed treasure map, asked you to memorize it as well as you could, and then took the map away and asked you to form an image of the map and scan various parts of it. This is a special kind of task that some people can do better than others, and the people who can do it well can do it very well. But people do vary greatly in their ability to function with such context-bound, specific, conscious,
effortful, and rich imagery.
The Kinesthetic Nature of Mental Imagery
Mental imagery, as we pointed out above, is not merely visual. And im-
age Schemas are kinesthetic in nature, that is, they have to do with the
sense of spatial locations, movement, shape, etc., independent of any particular sensory modality. Evidence for this comes from mental imagery experiments conducted with congenitally blind people. Experiments of the sort done by Shepard, Kosslyn, and their co-workers have been replicated with the congenitally blind. The principal experiments have been reported on in Marmor and Zaback (1976), Carpenter and

446 Case Study 2
Eisenberg (1978), Zimler and Keenan (1983), and Kerr (1983). The basic result is this: When mental imagery experiments are run with the congenitally blind using touch instead of vision, the results are virtually the same as for sighted persons, except that people who can see perform the tasks
faster.
Among the tasks used in these experiments were mental rotation and scanning tasks, both of which involve not just static images but continuous motion. It seems to me that the appropriate conclusion to draw from these experiments is that much of mental imagery is kinesthetic—that is, it is independent of sensory modality and concerns awareness of many aspects of functioning in space: orientation, motion, balance, shape judgments, etc. This includes image Schemas, which are sufficiently general in character to be prime candidates for having a kinesthetic nature. If richer, more detailed images have been shown to be kinesthetic, then it would seem that schematic images could be kinesthetic as well.
Conventional Images
Imagery of this sort is real, and the studies done by Shepard, Kosslyn,
and others have contributed a great deal to our understanding of images of this type. But they are by no means the only kind of mental images that people have. As a cognitive linguist, I am mainly interested in that aspect of cognition that is unconscious, automatic, and apparently effort-free and independent of skill. Language has this character, as does everyday commonsense reasoning. There also appear to be mental images that have these properties—what I will refer to as conventional rich images.
Being a member of a culture requires one to have a large stock of such conventional rich images. Americans, for example, tend to have images of Marilyn Monroe and Richard Nixon and Cadillac limousines and the Statue of Liberty. They also have images of horses and cats and roses and bicycles and engagement rings and baseball bats. As Rosch discovered, people often have images of prototypical members of categories—of typical cases, social stereotypes, paragons, and the like. And they tend to use such images in making goodness-of-example judgments. These images are conventional. They appear to be pretty much the same from person to person in the same culture. My image of a cup may be somewhat different from yours, but not all that different—unless you come from some part of the world where the things you eat and drink with are very different from those in America. Conventional images are not context-bound. You can form an image of a cup right now—without anyone presenting you with a particular cup or a picture of one. The image you form may or may not be of a specific cup. Most people are capable of forming nonspecific images.

Chaining within Categories: The Case of Over 447
ticular elephant. And it doesn't take any noticeable effort to imagine a cup or a car or an elephant, though it will probably take noticeable effort to imagine an elephant and turn your image 135 degrees. Moreover, conventional images seem to be unconscious. We seem capable of storing images of horses and sailboats and pizzas for very long periods without any effort and without even being aware that they are there. We also have conventional images of typical actions performed with these things. For example, we have conventional images of people eating pizza—most likely a wedge-shaped slice of a round pizza, with the point going in the mouth first, and probably not with a clean bite but rather with the cheese pulling away in its usual stringy fashion. Our conventional images may not all be exactly the same, but the degree of uniformity is remarkable.
Conventional images play an extremely important role in natural language. They are central to the formation of new idioms and to making
sense of old ones. There is an extensive class of idioms that I will refer to
as imageable idioms. These are idioms that have associated conventional images. Consider the idiom to keep someone at arm's length. I have asked hundreds of people if they have an image associated with this idiom. Almost everyone does, and it is almost always the same image.
Keeping Someone at Arm's Length
- The arm is oriented forward with respect to the body, perhaps a little to the side. It is never oriented backward, or upward, or downward,
though these are all logical possibilities. - The arm is chest high.
- The hand is usually open (though some have it making a fist). - The open palm is facing away from the subject; it is never facing
toward the subject.
- The angle of the hand relative to the forearm is roughly 90 to 135
degrees.
- The arm muscles are tense, not lax.
- The person being kept at arm's length is facing toward the subject.
The actual expression, to keep someone at arm's length, does not specify any of these details. In fact, it doesn't refer to a position of the arm at all, but only to a distance. The details just described are in the conventional image, not in the meanings of words. Interestingly, there are many things that are not specified in the image, things that are either simply absent or that vary indiscriminately from person to person. For example, is the arm clothed? Long sleeve or short sleeve? Answers to such questions are not
consistent, or the image isn't clear. Thus, some parts of the image are rel-

448 Case Study 2
In addition, speakers have knowledge about such images:

- The purpose of having one's arm in that position is defense. - If the arm were let down, the other person could get close enough to
inflict harm.

According to the classical theory of idioms, there is no reason at all why a

conventional image with specific knowledge should be associated with an idiom. According to the classical theory, idioms have arbitrary meanings:

I

any series of words could have any meaning at all. The idiom to keep

someone at arm's length has a meaning which is not physical. It means to

keep someone from becoming intimate, so as to avoid social or psychologi-

cal harm. In the classical theory, all that there is to idioms is such a pairing

of words with a meaning, and there is no reason whatever why speakers

should have a conventional image accompanying the idiom. What is the

image doing there? And how did people learn that association?

I would like to suggest that, in a very large number of cases, the mean-

ings of idioms are not arbitrary. The reason that they have been thought

to be arbitrary is that the meaning of the idiom is not predictable just

from the meanings of the individual words that make it up. In traditional

linguistic theory, anything that is not predictable is arbitrary. Hence, the

meanings of idioms, given traditional theories, must be arbitrary. But,

given the theory of cognitive models, there is a third alternative: motiva-

tion.

The relationship between A and B is motivated just in case there is an
independently existing link, L, such that A-L-B "fit together." L makes
sense of the relationship between A and B.

The meaning of the idiom to keep someone at arm's length is motivated— in large part by the conventional image described above. That image, plus two metaphors that exist independently in our conceptual system, provide the link between the idiom and its meaning. The two metaphors are:

- INTIMACY IS PHYSICAL CLOSENESS.
- SOCIAL (or PSYCHOLOGICAL) HARM IS PHYSICAL HARM.

Given the image, and the knowledge that the image is associated with defense, we get a link to the meaning of the idiom. Keeping someone at arm's length physically is keeping him from getting physically close, and thereby protecting oneself from physical harm. The metaphors map this knowledge into the meaning of the idiom, which is to keep someone from becoming intimate, so as to protect oneself from social or psychological
harm.

In detail, the explanation goes like this:
- The literal meaning of the idiom fits the conventional image (though it
underdetermines it).
- The image has accompanying knowledge. - The two metaphors map the literal meaning, the image, and its associ-
ated knowledge into the meaning of the idiom. - Letting A be the idiom and B be its meaning, L is the conventional im-
age plus its associated knowledge plus the two metaphors. L thus links
A to B.
What it means for an idiom to "be natural" or to "make sense" is that
there are independently existing elements of the conceptual system that
link the idiom to its meaning.
Let us take another example, the idiom spill the beans. Whether or not a given speaker has a conscious vivid image associated with this idiom, most speakers that I have asked informally seem to be able to answer questions like the following about the associated image: Where are the beans before they are spilled? How big is the container? Are they cooked or uncooked? Is the spilling on purpose or accidental? Where are they afterwards? Are they in a nice, neat pile? Where are they supposed to be? After they are spilled, can they be easily retrieved? Was the spill messy or relatively neat? Even speakers who claim not to have a conscious image can answer such questions. This suggests that they have an unconscious
image.
The images appear to have certain small variations. Speakers vary as to where the beans are before they are spilled: a pot, a crock, a bag, a jar. Most speakers have uncooked beans in their images; a small percentage have cooked beans. What is remarkable is that, despite such variations, the images are the same in the following respects: The container for the beans is almost always about the size of the human head; it is not barrel size, or silo size, or the size, say, of a small mustard jar. The beans were supposed to be kept in that container. The spilling is, or appears to be,accidental. The beans are never spilled into a neat pile; instead, they go all over the place. They are never easy to retrieve. The spill is always messy.
The uniformity of such answers is remarkable. On the usual theory that the meanings of idioms are arbitrary, there is no reason for any speaker to have any image at all, much less for most speakers to have images that are so much alike. But on the hypothesis that idioms are motivated, and that motivation may consist of a link of the form image + knowledge + metaphors, we can explain not only why there are such images, but also what forms they may and may not take. In this case, the rel-

450 Case Study 2

evant metaphor is the CONDUIT METAPHOR (cf. Ready 1979, Lakoff and Johnson 1980). According to the conduit metaphor, THE MIND is A CON-

TAINER IDEAS ARE ENTITIES, and communication involves taking ideas
out of the mind, putting them into words, and sending them to other
people.

The CONDUIT METAPHOR applies to this image in the following way. The

beans correspond to information. The container corresponds to the head. Therefore, the information is supposed to be kept in the head; that is, it is supposed to be kept secret. Spilling corresponds to letting the informa-

I

tion out, either accidentally or apparently by accident. The information

"goes all over the place," and the secret is out (the beans cannot all be

retrieved). The result is messy. Thus, the image plus the knowledge about
the image plus the CONDUIT METAPHOR provide a link between the idiom

and its meaning, a link which makes the idiom motivated, not arbitrary. Incidentally, it may be the case that the image is not stored, but gener-
ated when an investigator like myself asks someone. But this does not

change the point. We can see this by asking how it would be possible for

someone to generate such an image and why the images generated are rel-
atively uniform rather than random. Under the traditional theory of idioms, the words are simply associated directly with their meanings, with

no images or metaphors. There is no reason why speakers should'be able

to generate associated images or have knowledge about them. And if they generated them at all, one would, on the traditional theory, expect them
to be random, not structured in this way.

If the images are newly generated, not stored, then the theory we have given makes a prediction: the generated images will be among the conventional images of the culture, they will make use of cultural knowledge, and there will be one or more metaphors already in the conceptual system that link the image and the knowledge to the meaning of the idiom. In
short, the principles we have proposed to characterize the nature ofmoti-

vation for imageable idioms constrain what such images can be like. If the

images are newly generated, they are generated in accordance with these
principles.

I

We should also make dear what is not being claimed. We are not claim-

ing that either the meaning of idioms, or their form, is predictable. We are

only claiming that the relation between them is not arbitrary. Instead, it is

motivated, and the motivation makes the idiom "make sense." Thus, we

cannot predict why there are beans in spill the beans. However, beans and

spilling make sense since beans, when spilled, are hard to retrieve and

make a mess, and spilling either is, or can be made to appear, accidental. Given the existence of the CONDUIT METAPHOR, there is a sensible link be-

j<

tween our knowledge about spilling beans and the meaning of the idiom
spill the beans.
Incidentally, there is an extremely important consequence of this kind of analysis: parts of idioms may have metaphorical referents. Thus, the beans in spill the beans refers to the information that is supposed to be kept secret. Spill refers to making that information public. This is important if we are ever to understand the grammar of idioms. For example,
spill the beans can be passivized, as in The beans have been spilled. In this
case, the beans is a noun phrase that has a referent both in the source domain (the beans in the image) and in the target domain of the CONDUIT METAPHOR (the information to be kept secret). It may be that being a noun phrase and having referents in both source and target domains will
permit the idiom to be passivized.
It is important to bear in mind that we are, of course, not claiming that all speakers make complete sense of all idioms. Quite the contrary. There may be occasional idioms that are completely arbitrary for all speakers. There are certainly idioms that some speakers can't make any sense out of. Still most native speakers seem to make at least partial sense of most idioms, with much of the meaning being motivated and perhaps some being arbitrary. As one would expect, not all speakers make the same sense of all idioms. The best known case is A rolling stone gathers no moss, which not only varies in meaning from speaker to speaker, but has two primary meanings which are nearly opposites. On one reading, moss is taken to be a good thing, a symbol of the money and status to be accrued by staying in one place. The moral is that it's bad to move around a lot. On the other reading, the moral is the opposite. If you move around a lot, you don't get tied down. Moss is viewed as a bad thing, an encumberment that you get from staying in one place too long. It restricts your freedom.
Just as there are considerable speaker-to-speaker differences in the details of rules of grammar, and very great differences in vocabulary, so there are differences in the images associated with idioms. For most of the imageable idioms I have studied, there seem to be between one and three prevalent associated images, though in some cases there may be between a half-dozen and a dozen. This is by no means an unseemly amount of lexical variation. In fact, since associated images are hardly ever consciously taught or consciously learned, it is remarkable that there is any uni-
formity at all.
Motivating links for idioms—that is, cases where there is some link (L)
of the form conventional image + knowledge + metaphors relating the idiom to its meaning—have traditionally been cauedfolk etymologies. The
term arose in historical linguistics, where the goal was to come as'close as

possible to the "real" etymology, the real history, of each word and id-

iom. Folk etymologies are, to historical linguists, things to avoid, things

students are warned against. But since the real history of an idiom is

hardly ever known, folk etymologies are just about all there is for a his-

torical linguist to go on. Moreover, since hardly any ordinary person ever

really knows for sure the real origin of an expression, the folk etymolo-

gies that people automatically—and unconsciously—come up with are

real for them, not historically, but psychologically.

The fact that ordinary nonlinguists spontaneously and unconsciously make up folk etymologies is a truly remarkable psychological fact. Why

should this happen? On the view that the meanings of idioms are always

Similarly, if John hit a baseball with a bat in the usual way by swinging the bat at the ball, we could straightforwardly report that John hit a ball. But if he hit a beachball with a pizza platter, or if he hit a ball by throwing a rock at it, it would be misleading to describe such an event to someone who didn't see it as John hit a ball, even though such a description, strictly speaking, would be true. Hit a ball has an associated conventional image
that characterizes the normal case, and with no further modification we assume that the normal case holds. Thus, conventional images are used to
understand even the simplest, most straightforward sentences with no id-
ioms in them.

completely arbitrary, there is no reason at all. But if we recognize the

need to find motivating links that make sense of idioms, that people func-

Image Schemas

tion more efficiently with additional information that makes sense of oth-

erwise random information, then it is clear why people would try to make

sense of idioms by finding as many motivating links as possible.

The motivating links that people typically find to make sense of the re-

lationship between an idiom and its meaning usually consist of conventional images and metaphors. In the case study of anger, we encountered a great number of idioms that worked this way: simmer down, blow off

I

steam, flip one's lid, keep one's anger bottled up, wrestle with one's anger,

and so on. There appear to be thousands of idioms that are at least partly

motivated by associated conventional images. Such associated images

have an important cognitive function. They make sense of the idioms,

and therefore make them easier to understand, learn, remember, and

use. This is important to bear in mind in considering the nature of lexical

knowledge. Human lexicons are not just massive random lists of expres-

sions and associated meanings. Motivating links are included that make

sense of those associations. Any adequate psychological account of the

learning of, and memory for, the human lexicon will have to take account

of the phenomenon of folk etymology—that is, it will have to include an

account of why expressions with motivating links are easier to learn and

remember than random pairings.

Conventional images do not merely play a role in idiomatic expres-

sions. They are also central to our use and understanding of even the sim-

plest sentences. Rosch has observed that simple basic-level expressions

are used to refer to a prototypical instance of a basic-level category, but

that it is misleading to use such an expression to refer to a nonprototypical

instance. For example, if a sparrow lands on the front porch, it is not mis-

leading to report this by There's a bird on the porch. But it would be quite

misleading to use such a sentence to report that an eagle had landed on

the porch or that a penguin had waddled up the front steps.

Image Schemas of the sort we have been discussing are more like conventional images than like the kind of images discussed by Shepard and Kosslyn. Like conventional images, they are neither context-bound, nor specific, nor conscious, nor effortful. They are unlike conventional images in two important respects: they are not rich (that is, fully detailed), and they do not have specific knowledge associated with them. They are relatively abstract Schemas that organize what can be perceived and visualized, but they themselves cannot be directly visualized in the way a rich image can be. The drawings we gave above are not the Schemas themselves, but only drawings that characterize some of the properties of the Schemas and enable us to get some idea of what they are like. But any drawings will necessarily differ in many ways from the Schemas themselves. Take, for example, a schema that involves motion and the tracing of a path that exists in time. We have drawn such Schemas as static with a dotted line tracing the path. Drawings of Schemas with vertical extended landmarks (such as fig. 6) must necessarily sketch the landmark in a particular shape, while the Schemas are neutral with respect to the particular details of the shape of the landmark, as long as it is vertical and extended. Image Schemas can be visualized or drawn only by making them overly specific. In this respect, they are much like Kant's "schema" for a triangle, which Kant conceived of as fitting equilateral, isosceles, acute, and obtuse triangles without being rich enough in detail to be visualizable as
any particular one.
Let us turn now to the relationship between image Schemas on the one hand and perceptions and rich mental images on the other. It is my hypothesis that image Schemas structure both our perceptions and our rich images. This hypothesis appears to be necessary if we are to account for one of the most common of everyday phenomena, namely, the fact that sentences are judged as accurately describing visual scenes and mental

454 Case Study 2

images. Suppose you are either watching or imagining a plane flying and there is a hill on the terrain below. Take a simple sentence like

- The plane is flying over the hill.

You can now judge whether that sentence fits the scene you are watching

or imagining. Part of that judgment will involve whether schema

l. VX.NC (fig. 3) fits what you are perceiving or imagining. If the plane, in

your perception or imagination, is flying low to the ground around the

base of the hill, you would presumably judge the sentence as not fitting

the scene or image. A sentence like A plane is flying around the hill would

no doubt be judged more appropriate in those circumstances. The only

difference in these sentences is the choice of preposition: over versus

around. Over is the appropriate choice just in case there is an over schema

that fits the scene or image.

It is important to note that there are clear cases when a given schema

fits a perception or image, clear cases when it does not fit, and intermedi-

ate cases when it fits to a degree. Suppose first that the path of the plane

goes directly above (and not all that far above) the peak of the hill. Then

schema 1. VX.NC fits and the use of over is sanctioned. Suppose now that

the path of flight is not directly above the top of the hill but rather to one

side. If the path of flight is reasonably near the top, the over is still ap-

propriate. But the further the path of flight gets from being above the top,

the less appropriate it is to use over. And when the path of flight is above

Il

the valley next to the hill and not even near the top of tl?e hill, over is not

appropriate at all. How well the schema fits the scene or image will also

depend on the height of the flight path. Suppose that instead of being not

far above the top of the hill, the flight path is 50,000 feet up. Then the path

can be considered over the hill even though it is farther away from being

directly above the top. Thus, over schema 1. VX.NC characterizes a fuzzy

category of scenes and images. The central members of the category are

those scenes and images that are clear cases of the schema. The less clear

cases are less central members and those scenes and images that clearly

do not fit are not members. The schema can thus be viewed as a genera-

tive prototype, with the schema as the generator and closeness of fit as the

general principle defining degree of membership.

On Brugman's analysis, there are two levels of prototype structure for

over: (1) the radial structure of the category of Schemas, where each

schema is a member of the category, and (2) the generative structure of

the category of scenes and images, which is defined by each individual

schema. The perceptions and images are correlated with words via a two-

stage model; e.g., the perception of the plane flying over the hill is a mem-

ber of the category of perceptions and rich images that fit schema

Chaining within Categories: The Case of Over 455
l.VX.NC. That schema is, in turn, a member of the over category, which consists of a group of radially structured Schemas.
Let us now turn to the question of how it is possible for an image schema to fit a perception or an image. The hypothesis I am putting forth is that our perceptions and our mental images are structured by image Schemas and that the Schemas associated with lexical items are capable of fitting the Schemas that structure our perceptions and images. On this hypothesis, we do not have pure unstructured perceptions and images. Perceptions and images are not merely pictorial. In perceiving and in forming images, we impose a great deal of image-schematic structure. It is this image-schematic structure that allows us to categorize what we perceive. And it is this image-schematic structure that allows us to fit lan-
guage to our perceptions and rich images.
This hypothesis is anything but uncontroversial. For example, it appears to conflict with Kosslyn's cathode-ray-tube model of mental im-
agery.
We can think of the computer's central processing unit (CPU) and memory locations as the means utilized by the program to get its job done. Similarly, the brain can be interpreted as the vehicle for performing the work of the
mind.
The analogy between brain and computer also allows us to see how visual imagery can be picturelike without being actual pictures. The cathode ray tube (CRT) that displays information stored in the computer works by translating data encoded as bits into a physical, visible screen. The computer is able to interpret certain stored information as spatial images (whether or not it actually projects an image onto a CRT) because its CPU treats these data as if they were organized in a matrix; that is, these data function as if they
were stored in a matrix with some entries next to others, some diagonal from others, and so on. Thus, though the machine itself contains no actual screen, it can store and use material that is pictorial at the functional level. Our
model suggests that the brain works this way too. (Kosslyn 1983, p. 205)
Thus, according to Kosslyn, images are stored in the mind in dot-matrix fashion, just as they would be in a computer. The computer-mind knows
which cells of the matrix have black dots and which have white dots.
Thus, it could compute, for example, whether the black dots happened to form a diagonal line against a field of white dots, without actually project-
ing any picture on a screen.
Kosslyn's theory is inconsistent with our hypothesis that perceptions and images are structured by image Schemas. One of the reasons is that image Schemas may not actually appear in the images. Take image sche-
mas that indicate motion. The motion would not be represented in any in-
dividual dot-matrix image; it is a property of a sequence of such images,

456 Case Study 2
but doesn't occur in any of them. Moreover, in Schemas with an end-point focus but no actual movement, such as l.VX.C.E (fig. 10) "Sam lives over the hill," there is an understood path that goes over the hill. Such an understanding may be part of what is perceived or imagined, but it is not in a dot-matrix representation of the sort Kosslyn has in mind. Dot-matrix representations are simply too impoverished structurally to do the job— the job defined by the question: how can we represent the meanings of words to show how language can fit perceptions and rich images, while also showing how the senses of polysemous words are related to one an-
other?
These, of course, are not questions that Kosslyn and his co-workers have taken seriously, in the way that linguists like Talmy, Langacker, Lindner, Janda, and Brugman have. Taking such questions seriously can yield answers very different from the ones Kosslyn and his associates came up with. The most important such question is the question raised by Rudolf Arnheim in Visual Thinking (Arnheim 1974): Do we reason imagistically? On the dot-matrix view of images, the answer would have to be no. There is not enough structure there to characterize reasoning, and what structure there is is not of the right kind. But on the image-schema view, the answer could be yes.
Are Image Schemas Used in Reasoning?
Image Schemas appear to have the kind of structure that can be used in reasoning. Let us consider a very simple example. Edward Keenan and
Aryeh Faltz (Keenan and Faltz, 1987) have argued that there are
parts of English where the Boolean logic of classes is used in reasoning. This does not contradict the claim that real human categories go well be-
yond Boolean classes in the ways we have described. What the Keenan-
Faltz claim says in our terms is that there exist cognitive models embody-
ing the Boolean logic of classes; other kinds of models are not ruled out. This is in accord with the view expressed by Rosch (1981).
Keenan has observed (personal communication) that such Boolean reasoning can be understood as being based on the metaphorical understanding of classes as containers. In our terms, whatever Boolean classes
we use are really metaphorical projections of a particular kind of image schema, the container schema, which is used as part of one of the outSchemas (fig. 28). It is a simple schema with an interior, a boundary, and an exterior. To flesh out Keenan's suggestion, we also need the part-whole schema, which relates parts to the whole (there is no drawing that captures this intuitively). Using container Schemas, part-whole Schemas, and a metaphorical mapping, we can construct complex Schemas that match
i

Fig. 28. The container schema
the structures needed to characterize the Boolean logic of classes. These structures will intuitively match Venn diagrams.
Here is an outline of how it can be done. Consider the following mapping from image Schemas to classes:
- Container schemas are mapped into classes.
- Part-whole Schemas, where both parts and wholes are container sche-
mas, are mapped into subclass relations.
- Entities inside a container schema are mapped into members of the
class corresponding to that schema. - The exterior of the container schema is mapped into the complement
of the corresponding class.
Thus, if A is a container schema, A' (the result of the mapping) is a class. And if A and B are container Schemas, and 5 is a part of A, then 5' is a
proper subclass ofA'. If £ is the exterior of container schema A, then E' is the complement of A'. And if ^ is inside of container schema A, then
X' is a member of class A'. Union and intersection are defined as fol-
lows:

A

D

B

Fig. 29. Two overlapping container Schemas

458 Case Study 2

- Let container Schemas B and C be the only parts of container schema
A; A' is the union of B' and C'.
- Let container schema D be the largest container schema that is both a
part of B and a part of C. D' is the intersection of B' and C'.

Given these definitions, the usual theorems of the Boolean logic of classes
will be true.

Incidentally, this characterization of the logic of classes avoids the Russell paradox. The reason is that classes are defined metaphorically by a mapping from container schemas to classes. Given the nature of containers, no container schema can be inside of itself. Therefore, under the

metaphorical mapping defined above, no class could possibly be a mem-
ber of itself.

From the point of view of the theory of cognitive models, classes are understood metaphorically in terms of image Schemas in just this way. Reasoning done with such structures can be viewed as image-schematic reasoning. For a further example of image-schematic reasoning, consider path Schemas. If a trajector is at a given point on a path, it follows that it has been on all previous points on the path. Another example of imageschematic reasoning is scalar reasoning. Consider an extended landmark of the sort represented in figure 11. An extended landmark is a sequence of points. Each point can be understood metaphorically as a value of a scalar property P, and the landmark as a whole as the scale defining P. If X is at a given point on that scale, then ^f is more P than Y, if Y is lower on the scale, and less P than Y, if Vis higher on the scale. Langacker (1982) has even suggested how binding of variables and quantification might be done using complex image Schemas. Variable binding can be viewed as a metonymic mapping in which a typical instance of a category stands for the category as a whole. The differences among all, most, some, and no can be represented by points on a scale, with no as the lowest point and all as the highest. Langacker (1986) has also described in detail how image Schemas can be used to characterize the semantics of tense and aspect. Sweetser (1984) has suggested how reasoning with modalities can be done

using metaphorical projections of force images. Given Fauconnier's (1985) treatment of such classical problems of semantics as referential opacity and presuppositions using mental spaces, it appears that a great deal of reasoning can be characterized using cognitive mechanisms that
are not traditionally propositional in character.

At present, we do not know very much about the use of image Schemas

in reasoning. We have some glimmerings of how to do certain kinds of

reasoning using classes, some quantifiers, tenses, aspects, modalities,

-„4-„-/—*:„1 ^-„—•.

stand these in anything like full detail as yet. We are not even close to knowing what kinds of image Schemas are used in cognition and what
kinds of reasoning can be done with them. And the fact that reasoning
can be done with them does not prove that reasoning is done with them. Still, the very fact that it is possible to characterize modes of reasoning using image Schemas is exciting. It may be the case that the same cognitive models that structure perceptions and images are also used in reason. If this is true, it would provide an account of how knowledge gained from perception and knowledge gained from language can function together in
reasoning.
This is of special interest because it is usually taken for granted that only propositional structures are used in reason and that anything imagistic in character is not used in reasoning. Even so vociferous an advocate of mental imagery as Kosslyn is willing to grant that reason is purely prop-
ositional.
Consider the most elementary logical operations, like negation, quantification, disjunction, and so on. How would one represent such things using only images? . . . what about classes of objects? . . . How do we distinguish quantification from addition and subtraction? Let alone scope of quantification? Disjunction is no easier. . . . What are we going to do about tenses? . . . I suspect that with enough sweat, tears, and worn-out erasers some kind of imagery logic could be concocted. But compared to the standard predicate calculus, an imagery calculus would be unwieldy and awkward in the extreme.
(Kosslyn 1980, pp. 454-55)
Kosslyn, of course, is considering only rich images, not image Schemas. As we saw above, his theory of imagery precludes the very possibility of image Schemas. Kosslyn is also taking it for granted that predicate calculus is up to the task of accounting for all human reason. It simply isn't, and it doesn't even come close. But though Kosslyn is too sanguine about what classical logic can do, his challenges do have to be answered: Research into the logical properties of image schemas has barely begun, and we have no real idea of how much of human reason they can account for.
References and Conclusions
Detailed research on image schemas has mainly been done within linguistics. My own interest was kindled by Benjamin Lee Whorf's (1956) discussion of the role of image schemas in Shawnee stem composition. Over the past decade and a half, the most influential pioneer in this kind of research has been Leonard Talmy (1972, 1975, 1978a, 1981). Ronald Langacker's major foundational study (Langacker 1986) has provided an

age-schema research. The most detailed description of image Schemas in a non-Indo-European language is Eugene Casad's (1982) study of Cora, a short portion of which appears in Casad and Langacker (1985). The image-schematic structure of Cora is strikingly different from that of English, though the many of the elements and principles of image composition are similar. Keith McCune (1983) has demonstrated that Indonesian has a widespread system of language-particular sound symbolism that is

structured around image Schemas and metaphors. And within anthropol-

ogy, Naomi Quinn (1987) has done a detailed study of the role of image

Schemas in reasoning about marriage.

Over is not the only linguistic expression that has been given an image-

schematic analysis in considerable detail. Susan Lindner (1981, 1982) has

provided at least as detailed an analysis of the English verb particles up

and out. Laura Janda (1984) has done a similarly detailed study of the

Russian verbal prefixes za-, pere-, do-, and ot-. And Brygida Rudzka-

Ostyn (1983) has done a comparative study of Polish vy and Dutch uit.

Bruce Hawkins (1984) has provided an overview of English prepositions,

comparing the image-schematic approach to other approaches. And

Claude Vandeloise (1984) has provided a detailed image-schematic analy-

ty.

sis of certain French prepositions. All these scholars have reached essen-

tially the same conclusions as Brugman:

- The expressions studied (up, over, za-, etc.) are all polysemous; they cannot be represented by a single core meaning that accounts for all and only the various senses.
- Image Schemas and metaphorical models are required to represent the meanings of the expressions.
- The senses of each expression form a radially structured category, with a central member and links defined by image-schema transformations and metaphors.
- The noncentral senses cannot be predicted from the central senses, but are nonetheless not arbitrary. Rather, they are motivated by less central cases, image-schema transformations, and metaphorical mod-
els.

Brugman's study of over, like the studies by Lindner and Janda, shows that there is far less arbitrariness in the lexicon than has previously been thought. It may be arbitrary that the phonemic sequence /over/ has schema 1 as one of its meanings. But the fact that the same phonemic sequence denotes dozens of other Schemas does not multiply the arbitrariness, because the other Schemas are motivated. The pairing of /over/ with the central schema, schema 1, is an arbitrary form-meaning correspon-
