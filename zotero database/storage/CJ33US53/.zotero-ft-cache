Preface
In its general outline, Cognitive Grammar (CG) has been in existence for roughly three decades. Over this span of time it has not changed in any fundamental way. It has of course been subject to refinement and elaboration. Still, its continued evolution has mostly been a matter of working out the specifics of its application to varied linguistic phenomena. In a symbolic account of grammar, the key problem is to characterize the semantic structures it incorporates and serves to express. Progress in CG has therefore come about primarily through detailed conceptual analysis in numerous domains, requiring no substantial modification of the basic descriptive framework.
Reports of this progress are scattered in many venues often not readily accessible. The need to make them easily available was accommodated by two previous volumes in this series (Langacker 1990a, 1999a) and has now resulted in a third. The present volume brings together a dozen innovative papers reflecting recent work. Although they were first written independently, and pertain to diverse topics, they have been revised and integrated to form a coherent whole. And while they deal with important grammatical problems in considerable depth and analytical detail, the presentation builds from fundamentals and introduces the background needed for comprehension.
One source of the volume’s coherence is that a number of overlapping topics are examined in multiple chapters viewing them from different perspectives and in relation to one another. Among the topics covered in this fashion are grammatical constructions (their general nature, their metonymic basis, their role in grammaticization), nominal grounding (quantifiers, possessives, impersonal it), clausal grounding (its relation to nominal grounding, an epistemic account of tense, a systemic view of the English auxiliary), the “control cycle” (an abstract cognitive model with many linguistic manifestations), finite clauses (their internal structure and external grammar), and complex sentences (complementation, subordination, coordination). Though necessarily selective, the book thus provides a reasonably comprehensive survey of current research in CG and gives some indication of its future directions.

Chapter 1 Constructions in Cognitive Grammar
1. Architecture
More than one linguistic theorist has voiced the opinion that cognitive linguists, including myself, fail to recognize the existence of grammar. That is simply false. The question is not whether grammar exists – for it does – but rather, what is it like? Cognitive Grammar (CG) diverges from standard assumptions in two fundamental respects: (i) its claim that grammar is symbolic in nature; and (ii) its focus on constructions (rather than “rules”) as the primary objects of description (Langacker 1987a, 1990a, 1991, 1999a).
The first claim denies the autonomy of syntax. Crucially, though, we need to distinguish between two definitions of autonomy that have often been confused. By the first definition, syntax (and more generally, grammar) is autonomous unless it is fully predictable in terms of meaning and other independent factors. Let us call this weak autonomy. It implies that grammar does not just “fall out” or emerge automatically from other phenomena. Rather, it has to be specifically learned by children and explicitly described by linguists. Observe that weak autonomy says nothing about the nature of grammatical structure, bearing only on its non-predictability. The second definition says that grammar is autonomous by virtue of being distinct from both lexicon and semantics, constituting a separate level of representation whose description requires a special set of irreducible grammatical primitives. Let us call this strong autonomy.
All cognitive linguists accept weak autonomy. Grammar exists and has to be described as such. Only its nature and proper characterization are at issue. The basic claims of CG presuppose weak autonomy but constitute a radical alternative to strong autonomy. For one thing, CG holds that lexicon, morphology, and syntax form a continuum, divided only arbitrarily into discrete components. Moreover, it claims that lexicon and grammar are fully describable as assemblies of symbolic structures, where a symbolic structure is simply the pairing between a semantic structure and a phonological structure (its semantic and phonological poles). This has several consequences. First, grammar is not distinct from semantics, but rather incorporates semantics as one of its two poles. Second, grammatical description does not rely on special, irreducible grammatical primitives, but only on symbolic structures, each reducible to a

form-meaning pairing. Third, every construct validly posited in grammatical description has a semantic pole and is therefore meaningful (though the meanings are often quite schematic).
Like Construction Grammar, CG takes constructions, rather than “rules”, to be the primary objects of grammatical description (Fillmore 1988; Fillmore, Kay, and O’Connor 1988; Goldberg 1995; Croft 2001; cf. Langacker 2005c). Grammar comprises regularities of varying degrees of generality – patterns that speakers internalize and that linguists need to discover and describe. What are these patterns like, and how can we best describe them? Three kinds of devices have commonly been employed in linguistic description: rules, filters, and schemas. These imply different kinds of relationships between specific expressions (e.g. sentences) and the patterns they manifest.
By rules, I mean constructive rules analogous to the phrase structure rules and transformations of classic generative syntax. What is important here is the notion that rules and expressions are quite different in nature and related only indirectly. It is only required that, through their cumulative application, some set of rules serve collectively to “construct” a given expression. Rules do not necessarily resemble the expressions they help derive. Filters are negative statements indicating that a particular configuration of elements is not permitted. By definition, filters are distinct from the expressions they help describe. Schemas bear the closest relation to expressions. They are templates for expressions, representing the abstracted commonality of sets of expressions parallel in certain respects. Schemas are thus are directly analogous to the expressions they characterize apart from their level of specificity.
In CG, grammatical patterns are represented by means of schemas. A construction is defined as either an expression (of any size), or else a schema abstracted from expressions to capture their commonality (at any level of specificity). Expressions and the patterns they instantiate are thus the same in their basic nature, differing only in degree of specificity. Both specific expressions and abstracted schemas are capable of being entrenched psychologically and conventionalized in a speech community, in which case they constitute established linguistic units. Specific expressions with the status of units are traditionally recognized as lexical items. More schematic units correspond to what is traditionally regarded as grammar. The difference, though, is a matter of degree, and in CG these form a continuum. Every construction – whether lexical or grammatical – is characterized as an assembly of symbolic structures.
CG is highly restrictive owing to the content requirement. The elements permitted in a linguistic description are limited to: (i) semantic, phonological, and symbolic structures that actually occur as (parts of) expressions; (ii)

Architecture   3 schematizations of permitted structures; and (iii) categorizing relationships between permitted structures. Thus the only elements ascribable to a linguistic system are those which are either part of the primary data (namely, occurring expressions), hence directly apprehended, or else emerge from the primary data by means of the basic psychological phenomena of schematization and categorization. Ruled out by the content requirement are such elements as filters, purely syntactic primitives (with neither semantic nor phonological content), and derivations from underlying structures.
Let us then consider what the content requirement does permit. Permitted first, as shown in Figure 1.1, are semantic structures (abbreviated S) and phonological structures (P). These can be of any size and any degree of internal complexity. A symbolic structure (Σ) consists in the linkage of a semantic and a phonological structure (its two poles). Symbolic structures combine with one another (in ways to be discussed) to form assemblies of symbolic structures, which can also be of any size and any degree of internal complexity. When these assemblies are specific (rather than schematic), they constitute expressions (E), such as words, phrases, clauses, etc.1
Figure 1.1
1 When those expressions are entrenched and conventionalized, they are recognized as lexical items.

4   Constructions in Cognitive Grammar
Permitted next, as shown in Figure 1.2, are schemas (Sch). Each represents the abstracted commonality observable in sets of occurring expressions, or in schemas previously extracted. Schematization can be carried to whatever level of abstraction the data supports.
Figure 1.2
Also permitted are relationships of categorization, of which there are two basic sorts, described in Figure 1.3. One sort is the relation between a schema and more specific structures in which the schema is immanent (i.e. observable without distortion). These more specific structures thus elaborate (or instantiate) the schema. For this I use a solid arrow. A dashed arrow represents extension, implying some conflict between the categorizing structure and the one it categorizes. In this case the categorizing structure can be regarded as a prototype (at least in local terms).
Figure 1.3
A linguistic system thus comprises vast networks of structures linked by categorizing relationships, as sketched in Figure 1.4(a). Included in such networks are specific expressions with the status of conventional units, as well as schemas representing various levels of abstraction (or schematicity). Of course, a particular expression – whether fixed or novel – is categorized simultaneously by many schemas, each corresponding to a particular facet of its structure. Collectively, the set of schemas which categorize it constitutes its structural description (i.e. its interpretation with respect to the linguistic system), as shown

Architecture   5 in Figure 1.4(b). The expression is well-formed (or “grammatical”) to the extent that these categorizations involve elaboration rather than extension.
Figure 1.4
In this framework, grammatical patterns are captured by constructional schemas, i.e. schematic symbolic assemblies (Langacker 1987a: ch. 10, 1988a, 2000). A constructional schema describes, in schematic terms, how simpler expressions combine to form a more complex expression. It can therefore function as a template guiding the formation of new expressions, and also serves to categorize the relevant facets of such expressions, as shown in Figure 1.5.
Figure 1.5
Why does grammar exist? There would be no need for grammatical patterns if a minimal symbolic structure (i.e. a morpheme) were available to symbolize every notion we might have occasion to express. That of course is not feasi-

6   Constructions in Cognitive Grammar
ble because conceptualization is so flexible and open-ended. Grammar allows the formation of symbolically complex expressions capable of evoking novel conceptions of any degree of complexity. It does so by means of constructional schemas. Each such schema is a pattern for combining simpler symbolic structures to form more complex ones. As such, it specifies how their component elements are semantically integrated, and how they are phonologically integrated to symbolize their semantic integration. Consequently, patterns of semantic composition can be identified as the semantic poles of constructional schemas. Semantic composition is not distinct from grammar, but constitutes the semantic pole of grammar (just as lexical meanings are not distinct from lexical items, but constitute their semantic poles). These patterns of semantic composition do not completely determine the meanings of complex expressions (Langacker 2003b). Here, though, I will concentrate on grammatical constructions and the compositional aspects of linguistic meaning captured by constructional schemas.
2. Basic semantic notions
To describe in detail the CG view of grammatical constructions, I must first introduce some basic notions pertaining to semantic structure. In cognitive semantics, meaning is identified with conceptualization, in the broadest sense. Pivotal to linguistic semantics is our ability to construe the same situation in alternate ways (Langacker 1993a). Among the dimensions of construal are the level of specificity at which a situation is characterized, the perspective adopted for “viewing” it, and the degree of prominence conferred on the elements within it.
By specificity (or conversely, schematicity) I mean the level of precision and detail at which a situation is characterized (how coarse-grained or finegrained). This can be exemplified by an expression hierarchy like that in (1). Under appropriate circumstances, the same entity might be designated by any of these expressions.
(1) thing  object  vehicle  truck  pick-up truck  battered old pick-up truck
Perspective is multifaceted. Two of its facets are vantage point, illustrated by the contrast in (2), and direction of mental scanning, exemplified in (3). Sentence (2)a construes the situation as being seen from a vantage point in the attic, (2)b from a vantage point down below. The sentences in (3) describe precisely the same situation. They contrast semantically by inducing us to

Basic semantic notions   7
mentally scan through the scene in opposite directions in building up to its full conception. (2) a. Come on up into the attic!
b. Go on up into the attic! (3) a.	From home plate to the pitcher’s mound, the grass has all been worn
away. b.	From the pitcher’s mound to home plate, the grass has all been worn
away. There are many kinds of prominence that need to be distinguished. Only two concern us directly, namely profiling and trajector/landmark organization. Each is strongly motivated in purely semantic terms, and subsequently proves essential for describing grammar (cf. Langacker 1993b, 1999c). Every expression evokes some conception – simple or complex – as the basis for its meaning. Within its conceptual base, an expression singles out a particular substructure as a kind of focus of attention. This substructure, called the profile, is the one the expression designates (its conceptual referent). For example, as sketched in Figure 1.6(a), the word arc evokes as its base the conception of a circle, within which it profiles any segment.2 The base for roof is the conception of a house, within which it profiles the upper part that covers it. Two expressions can have exactly the same base yet differ in meaning because of the alternate profiles they impose on it. For instance, husband and wife both evoke as their base the conception of a male (M) and a female (F) linked in a relationship of marriage (represented by double lines). The semantic contrast between them is not a matter of conceptual content, but rather one of prominence, the choice of profile.
Figure 1.6
Crucially, an expression can profile either a thing or a relationship. Both notions are defined quite abstractly (Langacker 1987b). Here I can merely note
2 Observe that heavy lines indicate profiling.

8   Constructions in Cognitive Grammar
that things are not limited to objects or physical entities, and a relationship does not necessarily involve multiple participants. The expressions in Figure 1.6 profile things. Some examples of profiled relationships are given in Figure 1.7. As abbreviatory notations, I often employ circles or ellipses to represent things, and various kinds of lines or arrows for relationships. Note further that, because the conception of a relationship presupposes and incorporates the conception of its core participants, those participants are part of the profiled relation and are thus depicted with heavy lines.
Figure 1.7
The adjective smart exemplifies a one-participant relation. The profiled relationship consists of this participant (shown as a circle, since a person is a kind of thing) being situated beyond the norm (n) on a scale of intelligence. Prototypically, the preposition in profiles a two-participant relationship of spatial inclusion (but cf. Vandeloise 1991, ch: 13). The verb approach profiles an event in which one participant moves (single arrow) toward the other without reaching it, but does arrive in its neighborhood (given as an ellipse). In the case of throw, one participant exerts force (double arrow) on the other, causing it to move rapidly along an extended trajectory.
With expressions that profile relationships, a second kind of prominence comes into play. It consists in the degree of prominence conferred on the participants in the profiled relation. There is generally a primary focal participant, called the trajector (tr). This is the participant the expression is concerned with locating or characterizing. Often there is also a secondary focal

Basic semantic notions   9
participant, called a landmark (lm). Metaphorically, we can think in terms of primary and secondary spotlights, which can be directed at different elements within the scene onstage. Trajector and landmark can also be characterized as primary and secondary figures within the profiled relationship (Langacker 1999c, 2001a).
Relational expressions that evoke essentially the same content for their base can nonetheless differ in meaning by virtue of their profiles and/or their trajector/landmark alignment. A well-known example is the contrast between like and please. For both, we can posit a conceptual base involving two participants, with the roles of stimulus and experiencer, which interact as shown in Figure 1.8. The stimulus somehow impinges on the experiencer, who perceives or apprehends it and has a positive (+) affective reaction. The verb like describes the experiencer’s role in this interaction, so the experiencer functions as trajector, whereas please focuses the stimulus. Focusing one or the other participant naturally serves to highlight those aspects of the overall relationship it is responsible for. Consequently, the profile of like saliently includes the experiencer’s apprehension of the stimulus, while that of please centers on the latter’s stimulation of the former.
Figure 1.8
The constructs profile, trajector, and landmark are justified for purposes of semantic description but also prove essential to grammar. An expression’s profile – not its overall conceptual content – is what determines its grammatical category. For instance, a noun profiles a thing, as in Figure 1.6. Such classes as verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and prepositions profile various sorts of relationships. A verb designates a process, defined as a relationship followed in its evolution through time. The other classes mentioned profile relationships that are non-processual (or atemporal) – though time may well be involved, the profiled relationship is viewed holistically (rather than being scanned sequentially through time). They are distinguished by the nature of

10   Constructions in Cognitive Grammar
their focal participants. An adjective (e.g. smart) has a thing as trajector, but no focused landmark. An adverb is comparable except that its trajector is a relationship rather than a thing. By contrast, a preposition (e.g. in) does have a thing as focused landmark, while its trajector can either be a thing or a relationship.
Trajector/landmark organization provides the conceptual basis for the grammatical notions subject and object. A subject can be characterized as a nominal expression that specifies the trajector of a profiled relationship, and an object as one that specifies the landmark of a profiled relationship. Hence the subject of like, for example, designates the experiencer, and that of please the stimulus. Conversely for their objects.
3. Prototypical constructions
A construction is simply an assembly of symbolic structures. The CG characterization is basically the same whether a construction is specific or schematic, whether it is fixed or novel, and whether it is morphological or syntactic.
In a typical construction, two component symbolic structures are integrated to form a composite symbolic structure. They are integrated at both the semantic and the phonological poles, their phonological integration serving to symbolize their semantic integration. At either pole, integration is effected by correspondences (marked by dotted lines) that equate particular elements within the two component structures. To form the composite structure, corresponding elements are superimposed, their specifications being merged (or “unified”). As a consequence, component elements that correspond each correspond to the merged composite element derived by their superimposition.
Consider the phrase smart woman, sketched in Figure 1.9. The two component structures, smart and woman, are shown at the bottom. The composite expression smart woman is shown at the top. At the semantic pole, the adjective smart profiles a relationship that situates its trajector on a scale of intelligence. The noun woman profiles a thing. To simplify the representation, its many semantic specifications are simply abbreviated as W. The semantic integration of smart and woman hinges on a correspondence between the adjective’s trajector and the noun’s profile. By superimposing these elements and merging their specifications, we obtain the composite semantic structure, in which a thing characterized as a woman is located on a scale of intelligence. The composite expression profiles the woman (a kind of thing), so the overall expression is classed as a noun.

Prototypical constructions   11
Figure 1.9
This semantic association of smart and woman is symbolized by the integration of these words at the phonological pole.3 That is, the fact that smart qualifies woman semantically is symbolized by the fact that these words occur together in the speech stream in a particular linear (i.e. temporal) order. The speech stream is represented diagrammatically by the arrow labeled T (for processing time). The horizontal correspondence line equates woman with the word that directly follows smart in the speech stream. Phonologically, then, the composite expression derived by superimposing corresponding elements is smart woman.
The dynamic language employed above – saying that the component structures are “integrated” to form the composite structure by “superimposing” and “merging” corresponding elements – should not be taken too seriously. It is not being claimed that, in terms of actual processing, the component structures exist first, and the composite structure only subsequently. Nor is the composite structure seen as being constructed out of the component structures, which supply all its content. The composite structure is viewed as an entity in its own right, which may have properties not derived from either component.
3 Words are indicated by ellipses subscripted with lower-case ‘w’.

12   Constructions in Cognitive Grammar
More neutrally, then, I say that a construction is an assembly of symbolic structures linked by correspondences and categorizing relationships. Figure 1.9 illustrates how they are linked by horizontal and vertical correspondences. I will now describe how they are also linked by categorizing relationships. Though I will concentrate on the semantic pole, all the constructions discussed must be understood as being bipolar.
It is typical for one component structure to contain a salient schematic element which the other component structure serves to elaborate. This schematic element, corresponding to the profile of the other component, is called an elaboration site (or e-site) and is marked here by shading. In Figure 1.10, the semantic pole of smart woman, the elaboration site is the trajector of smart. The trajector is quite salient, the primary focus within the profiled relationship. Within the adjective itself it is also quite schematic; elaboration by woman serves to make it more specific.
Figure 1.10
The vertical arrows in Figure 1.10 indicate that the two component structures (taken as wholes) categorize the composite structure (taken as a whole). In what sense is their relationship one of categorization? Within a construction, the composite structure has special status: it stands in the foreground as the structure primarily employed for higher-level purposes. The component structures tend not to be invoked for their own sake, but rather as stepping stones allowing one to arrive at the composite structure. I take this asymmetry as being

Prototypical constructions   13
a special case of the asymmetry inherent in the relation between a categorizing structure and the target of categorization. Moreover, the composite structure is an entity in its own right, often with special properties not strictly derivable from the meanings of component elements considered individually. In other words, the composite structure is not literally constructed out of the components – the stepping stones are not building blocks. Rather, the components serve merely to evoke and motivate certain facets of the composite conception. As a general matter, the relation between them is more akin to categorization than strict composition.
In Figure 1.10, the categorizing relationship between the component structure woman and the composite structure smart woman is one of elaboration (solid arrow). This is because the two are fully consistent in their specifications and smart woman offers a finer-grained characterization of the profiled entity. On the other hand, the relation between smart and smart woman is given with a dashed arrow, indicating extension rather than elaboration. Considered as wholes, smart and smart woman are inconsistent in their specifications, particularly in regard to profiling: smart profiles a non-processual relationship, whereas smart woman profiles a thing. Thus, while smart contributes to the composite conception (or motivates a certain aspect of it), it is not precisely schematic with respect to it.
This is quite typical. In a construction, it is normally the case that the profile of one component structure, but not of the other, corresponds to the composite structure profile. The component structure whose profile is thus inherited at the composite structure level is called the profile determinant. Diagrammatically, the profile determinant is enclosed in a heavy-line box. In Figure 1.10, woman functions as profile determinant because smart woman designates the woman, not the relationship of being intelligent.
The phrase smart woman represents a specific symbolic assembly, i.e. an expression. This expression instantiates a constructional schema describing a general syntactic pattern for combining adjectives with nouns. Diagrammed in Figure 1.11 is the semantic pole of this schema, representing the abstracted commonality of countless adjective + noun sequences. The component structure on the left is the schematic representation of an adjective: it profiles a non-processual relationship of unspecified nature, except that its trajector is a thing, with no focused landmark. The component structure on the right is the schematic representation of a noun, which profiles a thing. The adjectival trajector functions as elaboration site and corresponds to the nominal profile. The noun is the profile determinant, so the composite structure profiles a thing which, as an unprofiled part of its conceptual base, participates in the relationship coded by the adjective. At the phonological pole, the schema specifies that the adjective directly precedes the noun in the speech stream.

14   Constructions in Cognitive Grammar
Figure 1.11
Constructional schemas provide the patterns a language makes available for the production of complex expressions. These schemas are themselves symbolic assemblies, hence meaningful, although their meanings are generally quite abstract. Their skeletal meanings are immanent in (i.e. they “lie within”) those of instantiating expressions, which elaborate them (“flesh them out”) in their own individual ways.
A constructional schema’s semantic pole constitutes a constructional meaning, the schema’s contribution to the overall meaning of composite expressions. With more abstract schemas, like Figure 1.11, constructional meaning is limited to specifying the grammatical category of symbolic elements, as well as organizational properties: how these elements relate to one another in terms of correspondences, categorization, and profile determinance. For instance, the specification that smart woman designates the woman (rather than the property of being intelligent) is a function of the entire construction, not of the component lexical items. It is likewise an aspect of constructional meaning that the profiled woman is the trajector of smart (the person whose intelligence is specified), rather than having some other role.
Whether specific or schematic, symbolic assemblies can in principle be of any size. When there are more than two component structures, it is usual for an assembly to exhibit multiple levels of organization, such that a composite structure at one level functions in turn as component structure with respect to another, “higher” level. The result is a kind of constituency. However, the constituency hierarchies posited in CG are not comparable to the syntactic “tree structures” of generative grammar, which are generally conceived as purely formal objects with no intrinsic conceptual or phonological content. On the contrary, CG constituency hierarchies consist solely of symbolic structures, each comprising a semantic and

Prototypical constructions   15 a phonological pole. Grammatical constituency is simply the order in which simpler symbolic structures are progressively integrated to form more complex ones.
Consider the nominal expression smart woman with a PhD, sketched in Figure 1.12 (ignoring the article). It consists of several canonical constructions: smart woman, already examined; a prepositional phrase, where with takes a nominal object; and the higher-level construction where the composite expressions smart woman and with a PhD combine as component structures to form the overall expression.
Figure 1.12
The representation of with is meant to indicate that it profiles a non-processual, essentially possessive relationship such that the trajector anchors an experiential dominion (Langacker 1993c) in which the landmark can be found. The schematic landmark functions as e-site, corresponding to the profile of the nominal component a PhD. Since the composite structure with a PhD profiles the possessive relationship (not the academic degree), with is the profile determinant at this level. At the higher level, the schematic trajector of the prepositional phrase corresponds to the profile of smart woman, which elaborates it and imposes its own profile on the higher-level composite structure. Hence the overall expression, smart woman with a PhD, designates the woman.

16   Constructions in Cognitive Grammar
Some basic grammatical notions are straightforwardly characterized in terms of symbolic assemblies as described thus far. As the term is most commonly understood, for example, a head can be defined as the profile determinant at a given level of organization (cf. Zwicky 1985; Hudson 1987). It is the component structure whose profile is inherited at the composite structure level, thereby determining the grammatical category of the composite expression. Woman is thus the head in the nominal expression smart woman, and with in the prepositional phrase with a PhD. Granted the constituency shown in Figure 1.12, the head at the higher level of organization, for the expression as a whole, is smart woman (and by extension, woman – as the head within the head).
We can go on to characterize the notions complement and modifier in terms of whether a component structure elaborates or is elaborated by the head. More specifically, a complement is a component structure which elaborates a salient substructure of the head. In Figure 1.12, the nominal expression a PhD is thus a complement of with, since it elaborates a salient substructure of with, namely its landmark (a focal participant). Conversely, a modifier is a component structure a salient substructure of which is elaborated by the head. Hence smart modifies woman in Figure 1.12, since the head – woman – elaborates its trajector. In the same way, with a PhD modifies smart woman at the higher level.
I should emphasize that these definitions refer exclusively to conceptual factors – profiling, profile determinance, correspondence, elaboration – observable at the semantic pole of symbolic assemblies. Despite their utility for describing grammar, these constructs are ultimately semantic in nature, not autonomous grammatical primitives.
4. Non-prototypical constructions
The constructions examined so far are reasonably considered canonical, or prototypical. They have a number of typical properties: (i) there are two component structures; (ii) one component profiles a thing, the other a relationship; (iii) the nominal profile corresponds to a focal participant of the relationship (its trajector or landmark); (iv) that participant is schematic, being elaborated by the nominal component; (v) the composite structure inherits its profile from one of the two component structures.
Grammatical constructions are nonetheless highly varied and deviate from the prototype in myriad ways (Langacker 1988b, 1999b, 2005a). Ultimately, it is only required that a construction comprise an assembly of symbolic structures linked by correspondences. Even this must be qualified if we make the terminological decision to regard single morphemes as constructions, so that

Non-prototypical constructions   17 all of lexicon and grammar can be described as residing in constructions. With this approach, a morpheme constitutes a degenerate construction, a symbolic assembly consisting of just one symbolic element. Hence there is no distinction between component and composite structures, nor any correspondences.
Also deviating from the prototype are constructions with more than two component structures. The previous example, smart woman with a PhD, might be analyzed in this fashion. On this account, diagrammed in Figure 1.13, smart and with a PhD modify woman at the same level of constituency, in a tripartite construction.4 It will be observed that, despite the difference in constituency, the overall composite structures in Figures 1.12 and 1.13 are identical, and the necessary semantic and grammatical relationships are expressed in both (e.g. woman is the head, modified by smart and with a PhD).
Figure 1.13
Which constituency is correct, the one in Figure 1.12 or the one in Figure 1.13? Actually, I suspect both of them are. In CG, essential grammatical relationships are conceptual in nature and captured by correspondences, not in terms of constituent structure. The same relationships can be captured with alternate constituencies, with the empirical consequence that constituent structure is often flexible, variable, and even indeterminate (Langacker 1995a, 1997a). In the case at hand, evidence for two alternate constituencies is pro-
4 I omit the internal structure of the prepositional phrase.

18   Constructions in Cognitive Grammar vided by the intonational possibilities in (4), where a slash (‘/’) indicates a slight pause. It is further corroborated by the ability of one to refer anaphorically to either smart woman or just woman, as seen in (5). (4) a. smart woman / with a PhD
b. smart / woman / with a PhD (5) a.	They’re looking for a smart woman with a PhD, not one with just a
masters. b.	A smart woman with a PhD is happier than a brilliant one with just a
masters. More generally, a number of adjectival modifiers can be strung together with no indication of any particular constituency hierarchy, especially when pronounced with pauses between them and with equal degrees of stress: big / ugly / vicious / dog. In this case I see no reason not to posit a multipartite construction, as seen in Figure 1.14. Each adjective ascribes a property to the modified noun, so the trajector of each corresponds to its profile.5
Figure 1.14
Many constructions depart from the prototype because they lack a head, or profile determinant, defined as a single component structure whose profile corresponds to the composite structure profile. Here we can distinguish three subcases. A unique profile determinant may be absent (i) because the compo-
5 Here I simplify by not indicating elaboration or e-sites.

Non-prototypical constructions   19
nent structure profiles correspond to one another, so they all correspond to the composite structure profile; (ii) because the composite structure profile represents a conflation of the component structure profiles and is not equivalent to any one of them individually; or (iii) because the composite structure profile is distinct from that of any component.
The first case is exemplified by appositional constructions, where two nominal expressions each describe the same nominal referent, in different ways. The nominal components range in size from simple nouns to full noun phrases: (6) a. pussy cat; sailor boy
b. my friend Henry Kissinger; the famous French novelist Marcel Proust c. the {fact / claim / idea / notion / myth} that syntax is autonomous Abstractly, such expressions have the organization sketched in Figure 1.15. Each component structure profiles a thing, these things correspond, and both correspond to the composite structure profile.
Figure 1.15
In cases like (6), we could make either of two terminological decisions: to say that both component structures are heads, or that neither is (since neither functions uniquely as profile determinant). I tend to follow the latter practice, essentially arbitrarily. I make the same terminological choice in the situation where the composite structure profile conflates the profiles of its components, none of which is thus equivalent to it taken individually. A favorite example is the “nested locative” construction: (7) The hammer is in the garage, on the workbench, behind the electric saw.
Any number of locatives can be strung together in this manner, with no apparent grouping into constituents. Each successive locative specifies the trajector’s location with greater precision (confines it to a smaller area). For our purposes, the important point is that the composite locative expression – in the garage, on

20   Constructions in Cognitive Grammar
the workbench, behind the electric saw – simultaneously locates the trajector with respect to three different landmarks. No one of these locative relationships stands out as the single location described by the overall expression. Rather, as shown in Figure 1.16, all three specifications are simultaneously valid and equally focused. The profiled relationship is complex, for it evidently conflates the simple relationships expressed by the individual component structures.
Figure 1.16
In the third type of construction lacking a head (traditionally called exocentric) the composite structure profile is distinct from that of both component structures. An example is pickpocket. In the verbal expression pick someone’s pocket, the verb pick has the conceptual value sketched at the lower left in Figure 1.17: the trajector exerts a force (double arrow), thereby inducing some object to move (single arrow). This object moves from its original location, which is focused as the landmark, into the trajector’s dominion (sphere of control). The noun pocket designates a location, shown as a rectangle, which functions as a kind of container. The circle within it represents the contents of the container, while the larger circle represents the article of clothing of which it is a part. In the compound pickpocket, correspondences identify the contents of the pocket with the object that moves, and the pocket itself with the landmark of pick (the location emptied of its contents). However, the composite structure does not inherit the profile of either pick (the action) or pocket (the location). Instead it profiles the actor, corresponding to pick’s trajector. Thus neither element of the compound functions as profile determinant.

Non-prototypical constructions   21
Figure 1.17
Pickpocket is idiosyncratic, in that the second element of an English compound normally functions as profile determinant (cf. Tuggy 2003). This can be contrasted with cases where an aspect of constructional meaning, while not inherited from either component, is nonetheless regular in the sense that it is specified by a productive constructional schema. Consider equative sentences in those languages where referential identity is marked simply by juxtaposing two nominal expressions. In Luiseño (a Native American language), a sentence like (8) predicates identity despite the absence of any verb or morphological element expressing this meaning. (8) Wunaal ya’ash no-kaytu. (that man my-enemy) ‘That man is my enemy.’
This is not an idiosyncratic expression but a regular construction, where equative sentences are productively formed using any appropriate combination of nominal expressions (NML). The constructional schema specifies that both component structures profile things, whereas the composite structure profiles a relationship of identity between them (given as a double line). As shown in Figure 1.18, the relationship profiled by the clause emerges at the level of the overall construction rather than coming from either component, but does so in accordance with a productive pattern. A particular expression like (8) is thus quite regular in formation, despite the absence of a head.

22   Constructions in Cognitive Grammar
Figure 1.18
Equational and appositional constructions are non-prototypical in that both component structures profile things. Grammatical combination does not require a predicate-argument relationship, such that a nominal component specifies a relational participant. Moreover, an elaboration site does not have to be a thing, but may itself be a relationship. This is the case with adverbs, e.g. fast, whose trajector is a process situated on a scale of rapidity. In Figure 1.19, a box represents the schematic process functioning as the adverb’s trajector. It will be seen that a phrase like move fast is analogous to smart woman.
Figure 1.19

Non-prototypical constructions   23
Nor is it required that an elaboration site be a focal participant. An e-site, defined as a substructure corresponding to the profile of the other component, need not even be particularly salient within the elaborated structure. An example is the compound woman smart, which is made-up but perfectly natural and wellformed. I interpret it as meaning ‘smart in regard to women’. We know that people often exhibit intelligence with respect to certain topics but not others. The notation in Figure 1.20 is meant to indicate that the property of being smart holds only in a particular domain of knowledge (represented as an ellipse), namely the one centered on a particular topic (given as a circle). This topic functions as esite, being elaborated by woman. Though pivotal to the expression’s interpretation, this e-site is not a focal participant of smart, nor is it highly salient.
Figure 1.20
Observe that the phrase smart woman and the compound woman smart have the same component structures but very different composite meanings. They differ in their constructional meanings, contributed by the constructional schemas they instantiate. Smart woman instantiates the schema for the adjectival modification of nouns, sketched in Figure 1.11. On the other hand, woman smart instantiates a semantically more flexible schema for compounds, where in general the second element functions as profile determinant. Thus, whereas smart woman profiles the woman, the compound woman smart profiles the relationship.
Of course, it is not even necessary that there be an e-site at all. Two component structures are capable of combining grammatically even in cases where

24   Constructions in Cognitive Grammar neither contains a substructure corresponding to the other’s profile. Consider the composite expression go away angry (e.g. Don’t go away angry!). The meaning of go away makes no intrinsic reference to the mental state of its trajector, nor does angry evoke an action which this mental state accompanies.
Their integration is sketched in Figure 1.21. The arrow labeled ‘t’ stands for time. As a complex verb, go away profiles a process, where development through time is salient as a matter of definition. The solid bar along the time arrow represents the span of time through which the event is followed in its temporal evolution. Being an adjective, angry merely profiles the situation of its trajector exhibiting a certain property. Continuation through time is not essential to its characterization – if a person is angry during a certain span of time, that person is angry at any single instant during that time span. It is however part of our understanding of angry that this emotion occurs in bounded episodes, enduring for some time on each occasion. A bar along the time arrow represents the duration of one such episode.
Figure 1.21
Although neither component structure elaborates a salient substructure of the other, they are integrated by virtue of two correspondences. First, their trajectors

Non-prototypical constructions 25
correspond – the person who goes away is the one who is angry. Second, the span of time through which the departure occurs is equated with the time span constituting one episode of anger; the expression cannot mean that the trajector goes away at one time and is angry at another, only that the two are temporally coincident.
Because neither component structure elaborates a salient e-site within the other, we cannot describe angry as either a complement or a modifier of go away. In cases like this the non-head component (angry) is generally called an adjunct. I should note that in CG the status of elements as complements, modifiers, or adjuncts is a matter of degree, reflecting the relative salience of particular notions within the global meanings of component structures. It is neither expected nor required that a particular term be obviously or uniquely applicable. That is, notions like complement, modifier, and adjunct are not unanalyzable grammatical primitives, but rather convenient labels for typical sorts of configurations that emerge with various degrees of distinctness in grammatical constructions.
An e-site sometimes exhausts the content of a component structure, rather than being limited to a proper substructure of it. This is commonly the case with derivational elements, which I generally analyze as being schematic for the category they derive. Consider the nominalizing suffix -er, as in swimmer, complainer, teacher, philanderer, etc. Prototypically, it forms a noun designating some kind of actor. As shown in Figure 1.22, it can then be characterized as evoking for its base the schematic conception of an active process, which I have indicated by means of an arrow with ellipses (…). Within this base, it profiles the actor, a thing. The schematic process, representing the entire conceptual content of the suffix, functions as e-site in this construction, being elaborated by a specific verb, in this case throw. Since -er is the profile determinant, the composite expression designates the actor in the specific process of throwing, and since it profiles a thing, thrower is a noun.

26   Constructions in Cognitive Grammar
When established as lexical items, symbolically complex expressions vary in their degree of analyzability, defined as the extent to which speakers recognize the semantic contributions of component elements. Novel expressions are fully analyzable, since the speaker has to construct them from component elements on the basis of their meanings. Established expressions may be less analyzable. They come as prepackaged assemblies, whose composite forms and meanings are well-known and well-rehearsed, so it is not essential that the component structures be mentally accessed individually. In fixed and frequently occurring expressions, there is thus an overall tendency for component elements to be activated only to a lesser degree, and perhaps not on every occasion of their use.
The result is that familiar expressions can often be ranked in terms of their degree of analyzability, e.g. flinger > complainer > computer > propeller > drawer. A novel expression like flinger ‘something that flings’ is fully analyzable. The lexical item complainer is highly analyzable (it is always understood as ‘one who complains’), but the others listed are progressively less so. In using the term computer, we do not always specifically think of it as ‘something that computes’, and a propeller is seldom thought of as ‘something that propels’. At the extreme endpoint of the scale, a form like drawer may be fully unanalyzable, in which case it constitutes a single morpheme.
Degree of analyzability is an important dimension of linguistic organization which has largely been neglected. It is unproblematic in CG, where constructions are viewed as assemblies of symbolic structures. Since the composite structure is a distinct entity, existing in its own right, in established expressions it can perfectly well be activated independently of the component structures. The contrast between a fully analyzable expression like the novel flinger ‘something that flings’ and a partially analyzable form like computer is represented in Figure 1.23. Words in capital letters are used here to abbreviate the semantic structures, and lower-case letters for phonological structures. Dashed-line boxes enclose structures that are activated only partially or only sporadically.
On this view, the analyzability of a composite expression into component morphemes is a matter of degree – a form like propeller is neither completely monomorphemic nor completely bimorphemic. Moreover, once degree of analyzability is recognized and accommodated, other well-known problems of classic morphemic analysis disappear (Langacker 1995a).
First, as seen in Figure 1.24(a), it is quite possible for just one symbolic component to be recognized within a more complex expression. For instance, the day of Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc. is certainly recognized by contemporary speakers, but the residue (Mon, Tues, Wednes, etc.) is not. We can simply characterize these expressions as defective constructions having a composite structure but only one (partially recognized) component structure.

Non-prototypical constructions   27
Figure 1.23
Figure 1.24
Beyond this, we can readily handle cases of phonological suppletion and semantic opacity. A case of suppletion is went, the past tense of go. Semantically the components GO and PAST are clearly evident, but phonologically there is just a single, essentially unanalyzable form. As shown in Figure 1.24(b), the symbolic unit went can be characterized as comprising a full, bipolar composite structure, while being defective in regard to component structures, which have a semantic pole but not a phonological pole.
Conversely, as shown in Figure 1.24(c), it is possible for a construction to be defective by including only the phonological poles of the component structures. An example is understand, which is clearly analyzable into the morphological elements under and stand, but which speakers find semantically opaque, making no connection to the meanings of the preposition and the verb. In the case of

28   Constructions in Cognitive Grammar
both went and understand the only symbolic link is at the composite structure level. However, these constructions still conform to the content requirement. 5. Grammatical dependencies In CG, grammatical dependencies are non-configurational. They reside in semantic relationships, primarily correspondences between conceptual substructures, not in any particular constituency configuration. Two basic kinds of grammatical dependencies are subject and object relationships. Both subjects and objects are complements: nominal expressions which respectively elaborate the trajector and the landmark of a profiled relationship.
Let us take the expression Jennifer likes that boy. It is normally ascribed the constituency shown in Figure 1.25, where the verb and object form a constituent excluding the subject. This corresponds to the normal intonational grouping, where a slight pause is possible between Jennifer and likes that boy: Jennifer / likes that boy. However, in deliberate speech it is possible to divide the sentence into three intonational units: Jennifer / likes / that boy. This suggests a tripartite structure, and while I do not claim that intonation always correlates with constituency, it is at least one factor that bears on it. As a secondary pattern, I presume that English allows the constituency shown in Figure 1.26. The configurational difference between Figures 1.25 and 1.26 has no effect on grammatical dependencies. In both structures, by tracing horizontal and vertical correspondence lines we find that Jennifer functions as the subject of like, and that boy as its object.
Figure 1.25

Grammatical dependencies   29
Figure 1.26
Figure 1.27
What about the other possibility, where subject and verb form a constituent, as shown in Figure 1.27? This too gives rise to the same composite structure and the same grammatical relations: Jennifer as subject, that boy as object. Though a pause after like is not very natural (?Jennifer likes / that boy), there are various more elaborate constructions where positing a subject + verb constituent does seem necessary. Among these are a clause-internal topic construction, as in (9) a, coordinate structures like (9)b,6 and object relative clauses, as in (9)c–d. To
6 See Chapter 12 for a different perspective on coordinate expressions of this sort.

30   Constructions in Cognitive Grammar

accommodate such expressions, I would simply posit a constructional schema allowing subject and verb to combine directly. This schema may be limited to larger contexts, represented by more complex constructional schemas, in which the verb’s landmark is elaborated at a higher level of grammatical organization. In (9)a, for instance, the landmark of likes is specified in a higher-level construction by a nominal functioning simultaneously as object and clausal topic.

(9) a. b. c. d.

That boy Jennifer likes (this one she doesn’t). Jennifer likes, and Sharon really admires, the boy who lives next door. The boy that Jennifer likes finally called. The boy finally called that Jennifer likes.

This approach to grammatical dependencies easily accommodates various phenomena that were handled in classic transformational grammar by means of derivations from underlying structures. An example is “relative clause extraposition”. Because sentences like (9)c–d are effectively equivalent semantically, and modification was thought to require grammatical co-constituency, a deep structure analogous to (9)c was posited for both expressions. Sentences like (9)d were then derived by an optional transformation serving to extrapose the relative.
The CG account is sketched in Figures 1.28–29, ignoring everything not essential to the point at hand. In 1.28, the relative clause combines with the head noun in a canonical modifying construction. I have not shown the internal structure of the relative, which is a subject + verb constituent, equivalent to the lower portion of Figure 1.27. At the composite structure level, it profiles the process of liking, with a specified trajector (Jennifer) and a schematic landmark. It modifies the head noun, boy, by virtue of a correspondence between its landmark and the nominal profile. This correspondence identifies boy as the semantic object of like. At the higher level of organization, the subject nominal the boy that Jennifer likes elaborates the trajector of call (whose processual profile is simply represented as a solid arrow).
The alternative expression in (9)d, with an extraposed relative, is diagrammed in Figure 1.29. Here the boy and finally called are integrated in the usual fashion to form a clause at the lower level of constituency. The relative, that Jennifer likes, combines with this clause as a whole in the higher-level construction. However, while the two clauses combine as wholes, their integration hinges specifically on a correspondence between the landmark of the relative and the main clause trajector. Owing to this correspondence, the relative functions to describe the boy, which is identified as the semantic object of like. This is not a canonical modifying construction, since the head – which is the full main clause, the boy finally called – does not per se elaborate the landmark of the relative. The semantic effect of modification is nonetheless achieved.

Grammatical dependencies   31
Figure 1.28
Figure 1.29
Relative clause extraposition does not come for free – speakers have to learn the construction (and the various restrictions on it), and linguists have to describe it by positing the appropriate constructional schemas. Still, this alternative grammatical option does not require any special theoretical apparatus (like deep structures and transformations). It is straightforwardly accommodated with the same theoretical devices employed for the basic pattern.

32   Constructions in Cognitive Grammar
In Figures 1.28–29, correspondences identify the boy as being both the trajector of call and the landmark of like. Accordingly, in the composite semantic structure this same individual is simultaneously depicted as participating in both relationships. It is usual and unproblematic for the same conceptual element to have multiple roles, each pertaining to a particular relationship coded at a particular level of organization. In (10), for example, a rock functions simultaneously as the landmark (object) of throw and as the trajector (subject) of into the pond. (10) She threw a rock into the pond.
Their integration is sketched in Figure 1.30. At the first level of constituency, a rock elaborates the landmark of throw in a normal direct object construction. Throw implies that the landmark, due to the force exerted by the trajector, moves rapidly along an extended spatial path. Throw itself of course evokes this path only schematically. Still, the conception of the landmark successively occupying all the spatial positions defining a path is an inherent aspect of throw’s meaning, and in the higher-level construction it functions as an elaboration site. Shown as a rectangle in Figure 1.30, this substructure of throw a rock is elaborated by the path prepositional phrase into the pond, which describes the path in more specific detail. Through horizontal and vertical correspondences, the rock is thus identified as both the landmark of throw and the trajector of into the pond.
Figure 1.30
A final, more elaborate example is the following Luiseño sentence (cf. Langacker 1973):

Grammatical dependencies   33 (11) Noo poy  ngee-vichu-ni-q.     ‘I made him want to leave.’
I    him leave-want-make-tns Syntactically, it consists of a morphologically complex verb together with a subject and an object pronoun. Semantically, we need to show that the speaker is the “logical subject” of ‘make’ (i.e. the one who does the making), while the object ‘him’ has multiple roles: as the semantic object of ‘make’ (the target of the agent’s force), and as the semantic subject of both ‘want’ and ‘leave’.
In Figure 1.31, I show how the verb stem ngeevichuni ‘make want to leave’ is progressively assembled. The component elements are ngee ‘leave’, -vichu ‘want’, and -ni ‘make’. The root ngee profiles the trajector’s motion away from some original location. The suffix -vichu ‘want’ designates the trajector’s desire (dashed arrow) for the occurrence of some process, which functions as a kind of landmark (a relational landmark rather than a nominal one). Since -vichu is only used for cases where the process desired is one carried out by its trajector, a correspondence internal to its semantic pole identifies the trajector of -vichu with the actor of the landmark process. Finally, -ni profiles an act of causation (double arrow), where the force is directed at a target (a nominal landmark) by way of inducing some occurrence (a relational landmark). The nominal landmark is simultaneously the target of force and the trajector of the schematic process induced.
Figure 1.31

34   Constructions in Cognitive Grammar
The verb stem is straightforwardly assembled by constructions representing two successive levels of morphological organization. At the lower level, ngee ‘leave’ specifies the schematic process functioning as the landmark of -vichu ‘want’, i.e. the desired event. The composite expression ngeevichu thus profiles the process of the trajector desiring an event consisting of the trajector leaving. At the higher level of organization, ngeevichu specifies the caused occurrence schematically evoked by -ni ‘make’. The nominal landmark of -ni is thus identified with the trajector of ngeevichu, i.e. with the person who has the desire and the one who does the leaving. At higher levels of organization (not shown), the subject pronoun noo ‘I’ elaborates the trajector, and the object pronoun poy ‘him’ specifies the landmark. The speaker is thus identified as the causer, and ‘him’ as the target of force, the wanter, and the leaver.
6. Constituency
The foregoing examples suggest how CG handles the complexities of grammatical structure without positing syntactic tree structures. To the extent that it is valid, the information captured in such tree structures is also captured in the CG account based on symbolic assemblies. Three kinds of information are represented in classic generative phrase trees: constituency, linear order, and category membership (via node labels). It is not denied that these kinds of information need to be provided, only that their expression requires a separate, autonomous formal device.
Given that basic grammatical categories have conceptual characterizations, and that an expression’s category is determined by the nature of its profile, category information is inherent in each symbolic structure in an assembly, as an aspect of its semantic structure. In Figure 1.30, for example, throw is a verb because it profiles a process, rock is a noun because it profiles a thing, and into a preposition because it profiles a non-processual relationship with a thing as landmark. Higher-level categories are also susceptible to semantic or symbolic characterization. A full noun phrase – what I call a nominal – profiles a thing which is grounded, i.e. a grammaticized indication is given of its relation to the speech situation. The composite expressions a rock and the pond are thus identified as nominals by virtue of being grounded by the indefinite and definite articles. Similarly, a prepositional phrase can be characterized as a symbolic assembly in which a nominal elaborates the preposition’s landmark. Into the pond is thus a prepositional phrase (though I have not shown the full assembly in Figure 1.30).
Linear order is actually temporal order in the speech stream. As such, this aspect of symbolic assemblies is specified at the phonological pole of each sym-

Constituency   35

bolic structure. In Figure 1.9, for instance, the composite phonological structure of smart woman indicates that the word symbolizing the adjective directly precedes the word symbolizing the noun (T = processing time). Importantly, this dimension of phonological structure, exploited for grammatical (symbolizing) purposes, is given as part of the internal structure of each symbolic element. It is not essential that linear order be represented in these diagrams by relative position on the page of the component symbolic structures.
Finally, constituency is a matter of a composite structure in one construction functioning in turn as component structure in another – the order in which simpler symbolic structures are successively integrated to form progressively more elaborate symbolic structures. It is just a matter of hierarchy, a general feature of cognitive organization, even motor routines.
A crucial point is that grammatical constituency pertains to the external arrangement of symbolic structures, taking these as wholes (i.e. as bipolar entities). This external hierarchical arrangement need not coincide with any hierarchical structure evident internally at the semantic or phonological pole of symbolic elements. That is, grammatical constituency need not parallel any purely conceptual hierarchy manifested in the semantic pole of component or composite symbolic structures, nor any purely phonological hierarchy manifested in their phonological poles. Internally, at each pole, any hierarchical arrangement is determined locally, by factors that are intrinsically conceptual or intrinsically phonological (hence unipolar – see Langacker 1987a: § 2.3.1.2).
For example, in casual pronunciation the definite article cliticizes to the following word, with which it forms a single intonational unit. A nominal such as the smart woman therefore shows the intrinsically phonological organization indicated in (12)a. Semantically, however, the article does not pertain to the adjective, but to the entire nominal expression. For semantic and grammatical purposes, we want to say that it combines with the remainder of the nominal as the last step in assembling it, implying the constituency in (12)b.

(12) a. (th’smart) (woman) b. (the) (smart woman)

[unipolar (purely phonological) constituency] [bipolar (grammatical) constituency]

This apparent discrepancy is unproblematic given the distinction between grammatical hierarchy – pertaining to the external arrangement of symbolic structures as bipolar entities – and the phonological hierarchy internal to each symbolic structure at its phonological pole, viewed as a purely phonological (unipolar) entity. Unipolar phonological structure involves the grouping of segments into syllables, syllables into words, words into phonological phrases, etc. The phonological elements directly relevant to grammar are those defined in bipolar terms, i.e. through their participation in symbolic relationships. We

36   Constructions in Cognitive Grammar
should not expect that these will always coincide with natural phonological units (e.g. morpheme boundaries do not necessarily coincide with syllable boundaries), nor that the two will mirror one another in their hierarchical arrangements.
Diagrammed in Figure 1.32 is the phonological pole of th’smart woman, for the normal pronunciation (12)a. In terms of grammatical constituency, where phonological elements are delimited by their participation in symbolic relationships, the constituency is the expected one, represented in (12)b. At the lower level of organization, smart and woman combine to form smart woman, and then, at the higher level of organization, the definite article combines with this to form the full nominal. In casual speech, the definite article cliticizes to the following word. I represent its clitic status by showing the consonant th as combining with a word to form a higher-level word. Of course, internally to the definite article the word it combines with is specified only schematically. In the construction, this word is put in correspondence with the first word of the other component structure, in this case smart. The composite phonological structure is thus as given in (12)a.
Figure 1.32
The expression’s semantic pole is sketched in Figure 1.33. Grammatically, i.e. in terms of the external relationships between semantic structures, woman and smart combine at the lower level of constituency, with smart woman then combining with the at the higher level. Internally, the semantic structures of

Constituency   37 smart, woman, and smart woman are just as shown in previous diagrams. As for the article, the contextual definiteness it conveys is represented by dashed arrows indicating that the speaker (S) and hearer (H) are able to direct their attention to the same focused entity, characterized schematically as a thing. In the higher-level construction, this thing functions as an e-site. It corresponds to the profile of smart woman, which elaborates it.
Figure 1.33
How can the definite article pertain to the noun woman in particular when it combines grammatically with the composite expression smart woman? The answer is that smart woman, despite its grammatical complexity, profiles the woman at the composite structure level. That is, the woman is the conceptual referent of the composite expression, just as it is for woman individually. Since profiling determines grammatical category, the composite expression smart woman is itself a complex noun. The definite article can thus combine with it by virtue of a correspondence between their profiles, just as it can with a simple noun. In short, the grammatical constituency, where smart and woman are on a

38   Constructions in Cognitive Grammar
par, is not isomorphic to the internal conceptual organization at the composite structure’s semantic pole, where only the woman stands in profile.
Grammatical constituency is straightforwardly accommodated in CG as a particular form symbolic assemblies can assume. In this section and the previous one, however, I have tried to show that it is less central, and its role more limited, than is commonly assumed. When it is properly distinguished from purely conceptual and purely phonological organization, and when the pivotal role of correspondences is recognized, grammatical constituency can be seen as non-essential and often variable. It is not fundamental, but emerges as a special case from other, more basic phenomena (Langacker 1995a, 1997a).
7. Conclusion
The question is often posed whether grammar is predictable from semantics and other independent factors. From a negative answer to that question, it is generally concluded that grammar constitutes an autonomous formal system. I suggest, however, that this conclusion is unwarranted, if only because the reasoning fails to distinguish between strong and weak autonomy. The nonpredictability of grammar, i.e. weak autonomy, does not itself determine what kinds of units are needed to describe it. In particular, it does not establish the claim of strong autonomy: that grammar is distinct from both lexicon and semantics, constituting a separate level of representation whose description requires a special set of irreducible grammatical primitives. I have outlined an alternative view which accommodates weak autonomy while denying strong autonomy. In CG, grammar and lexicon form a continuum fully describable as assemblies of symbolic structures (form-meaning pairings). On this account, it makes no sense to ask whether grammar is predictable from meaning, since grammar incorporates meaning, as one of its two poles. The question is analogous to asking whether the phonological shape of a lexical item can be predicted from its semantic value. While the answer is clearly negative, it does not establish the independence of lexicon from semantics. A dictionary listing only lexical forms, without their meanings, would not be very interesting.
A more reasonable question to pose is why grammar should exist in the first place. I can best conclude by quoting a previous answer (Langacker 1999b: 55):
Grammar would not exist if lexical units were available to symbolize every conception we wanted to express. But they are not. Lexical units form a limited set, while the conceptions we want to encode linguistically are open-ended and indefinitely varied. To overcome this, we resort to complex expressions consisting of multiple

Conclusion   39
lexical elements. Each lexical component evokes some facet of the overall conception, one singled out precisely by virtue of being susceptible to individual symbolization. Collectively, these individually symbolized conceptual “chunks” give enough information about the composite conception intended by the speaker that the addressee, in context, is able to reconstruct some approximation to it. However, this reconstruction requires some indication of how the conceptual chunks are supposed to fit together. The role of grammar is to provide this information.

Chapter 2 Metonymy in grammar
Grammar consists in assemblies of symbolic structures linked by correspondences. In Chapter 1, I made the simplifying assumption that the corresponding elements can always be precisely specified. The present chapter argues that this basic picture needs qualification. Correspondences are indeed crucial for semantics and grammar, but owing to the conceptual complexity of linguistic meanings, there are limits to the precision of their specification. While the specific connections shown in diagrams are valid and essential as first approximations, in a coarse-grained view, they prove more flexible and variable when viewed at a higher resolution.
1. Indeterminacy
An assumption usually made in syntactic theory and description is that particular elements combine with one another in very specific and determinate ways. Syntactically, for example, the sentence Alice likes Bill involves a specific structural configuration, with the elements Alice, likes, and Bill inserted in particular slots. Semantically, the predicate LIKE has two arguments, which ALICE and BILL instantiate in accordance with their syntactic roles.
(1) a. [ [Alice]NP [ [likes]V [Bill]NP ]VP ]S b. LIKE(x,y)  x = ALICE y = BILL
This supposed property, that it is possible to give a definite and precise specification of the elements connected to one another and how they are connected, will be referred to as determinacy. The doctrine of determinacy belongs to a broader conception of language, mind, and meaning, which holds that language is a separate mental “module”, that syntax is autonomous, and that semantics is well-delimited and fully compositional. This broader conception is not however well-founded. Over the last few decades, research in cognitive linguistics has demonstrated that grammar is not autonomous from semantics, that semantics is neither well-delimited nor fully compositional, and that language draws on more general cognitive systems and mental capacities from which it cannot be neatly separated. The issue of determinacy must therefore be re-examined from this newer perspective.

Active zones 41
I suggest that the usual situation is not one of determinacy, but rather indeterminacy (Langacker 1998a). Precise, determinate connections between specific elements represent a special and perhaps unusual case. It is more common for there to be some vagueness or indeterminacy in regard to either the elements participating in grammatical relationships or the specific nature of their connection. Otherwise stated, grammar is basically metonymic, in that the information explicitly coded linguistically does not itself establish the precise connections apprehended by the speaker and hearer in using an expression. Explicit indications evoke conceptions which merely provide mental access to elements with the potential to be connected in specific ways – the details have to be established from other considerations. Metaphorically speaking, explicit linguistic coding gets us into the right neighborhood, but from there we have to find the right address by other means. Perhaps the crude diagrams in Figure 2.1 capture the spirit of this proposal. If diagram (a) reflects the archetypal conception of classic syntactic theory, diagram (b) is more reflective of linguistic and cognitive reality.
Figure 2.1
2. Active zones
I am claiming that grammar is basically metonymic in nature. In contrast to the standard view that particular elements combine in very specific and determinate ways, I am suggesting that the canonical situation is actually one of indeterminacy. This is not apparent from the diagrams in Chapter 1, which show specific connections between specific elements, in the form of correspondences (dotted lines). It is not that those diagrams are wrong; working out the correspondences – determining which particular substructures correspond to one another between the components of a symbolic assembly – is critical for describing it explicitly. The point, rather, is that constructions can also be viewed in finergrained conceptual detail, where a range of variation may be observed.
Let me first say that indeterminacy in grammar is not an excuse for vague or imprecise description. If a construction is indeterminate in some respect, as a matter of principle we still have to describe the construction, including its indeterminacy, and we still want our characterization to be explicit and precise,

42   Metonymy in grammar
even in regard to the nature and extent of the indeterminacy. We must not confuse indeterminacy at the level of the phenomenon with indeterminacy at the level of its description.
In standard approaches to syntax and semantics, indeterminacy fails to become apparent because there is no real attempt to deal with conceptual structure. Assumptions made in truth-conditional semantics specifically exclude from its scope of concern the very factors that are most responsible for indeterminacy – factors like construal, imaginative phenomena, and encyclopedic semantics. Formulas like (1)b say nothing about the actual conceptualizations they represent. There is no attempt, for instance, to spell out the internal conceptual structure of a predicate; however complex this may be, it is simply represented by means of an atomic, unanalyzable symbol (e.g. LIKE). And obviously, syntactic structures like (1)a are not intended, and not able, to capture the specific details of the conceptualizations evoked by the expressions described.
Indeterminacy starts to become apparent as soon as one adopts a conceptualist semantics and a symbolic view of grammar that incorporates semantics as one of its poles. Instead of merely saying that elements combine with other, as unanalyzed wholes, it becomes necessary to say precisely how they combine, in terms of their conceptual integration. Here too, matters look determinate under certain conditions that are quite common given practical constraints: for selected examples; in preliminary analyses that do not go into very much conceptual detail; and in describing general patterns, where the whole point is to abstract away from the specifics of individual expressions. For instance, if we consider prepositional phrases in general, we can posit a constructional schema based on a correspondence between two specific elements, namely the landmark of the preposition and the profile of its nominal object. It is only when we look more closely at the conceptual import of specific expressions that the extent of grammatical indeterminacy begins to reveal itself.
I first became aware of this, over two decades ago, through cases involving a discrepancy between profile and active zone (Langacker 1984). Let us confine our attention to cases where a nominal expression, which profiles a thing, combines with a relational expression with respect to which it functions as subject or object. This is a matter of the nominal profile corresponding to the trajector or the landmark of the profiled relationship. Yet in many cases the thing profiled by the nominal is not precisely the same as the one that actually participates in that relationship. There is a discrepancy between the profile of the nominal and its active zone. An entity’s active zone, with respect to a profiled relationship, is defined as that facet of it which most directly and crucially participates in that relationship.

Active zones   43
Consider sentence (2):
(2) The cigarette in her mouth was unlit.
The subject nominal, the cigarette in her mouth, is syntactically analogous to Figure 1.12, smart woman with a PhD. The head noun cigarette specifies the trajector of in, and the nominal her mouth specifies its landmark. Thus, if in has the spatial meaning shown in Figure 2.2(a), the expected import of (2) is that the entire cigarette was inside the cavity identified as her mouth. It would then be very fortunate that the cigarette was not lit. But of course, that is not the way we understand the sentence. We do not take it as meaning that the cigarette, as an undifferentiated whole, was inside the mouth, as an undifferentiated whole. Instead we interpret it as meaning that a particular portion of the cigarette (one end) was contained in a particular portion of the mouth (a segment of the lips). Those portions constitute the active zones of the cigarette and of the mouth with respect to the in relationship. There is in each case a discrepancy between the active zone and the nominal profile. One end of a cigarette is not what we take to be the referent (profile) of cigarette. Nor is part of the lips what we identify as the referent of mouth. The entities we explicitly mention with the subject and object nominals are not the ones most directly and crucially involved in the profiled relationship.
Figure 2.2
This situation – profile/active-zone discrepancy – is not at all unusual. In fact, it is quite common, even typical. Sticking with in, for the moment, the examples in (3) are all quite normal (cf. Vandeloise 1991: ch. 13). They respectively correspond to the diagrams in Figure 2.2. The expressions in (3) a exemplify full spatial inclusion: the entire trajector is inside the landmark, and no one portion of the landmark stands out as the only one directly involved. In other words, the entities profiled by the subject and object nominals participate as wholes in the profiled relationship. In (3)b, on the other hand, only a portion of the trajector is spatially included in the landmark (and in some cases only part of the landmark is involved). This portion of the trajector, indicated by shading, constitutes its active zone with respect to the in relation.

44   Metonymy in grammar

(3) a.	the cake in the oven; the letter in the envelope; the air in the balloon; the dresser in the bedroom; the food in my stomach

b.	the swan in the water; the axe in your hand; the arrow in the target; the sword in the scabbard; the cork in the bottle

Such discrepancies are typical for subjects and objects.1 The verbs in (4)a, for example, designate processes involving different facets of a person, yet the subject nominal refers to this person as an undifferentiated whole. A verb like hit is quite vague as to which portions of the trajector and the landmark participate directly. Any part of the landmark might be affected. We can overcome this indeterminacy by adding a prepositional phrase to specify the active zone, as in (4)b. Of course, this does not completely resolve the indeterminacy. If she hit me in the arm, was it the left arm or the right? Where on the arm did she make contact? We can never be totally precise, and usually we do not even try. With respect to the trajector of hit, the active zone is typically the fist, but that is only the default. Here as well the options can be spelled out using a prepositional phrase, as in (4)c. Note that the active zone need not even be a subpart of the subject. It might be a stick which the subject is holding, or even a projectile which she throws, like a baseball. In (4)d, what is actually perceived – a sound or a cloud of dust – is merely associated with the entity profiled by the object nominal, not a subpart of it. As for the subject, only the speaker’s perceptual apparatus is directly involved in the profiled relationship.

(4) a.
b. c.
d.

The boy {blinked / waved / coughed / meditated / yawned / stretched / smiled / urinated}. She hit me (in the {arm / stomach / mouth / back / leg / knee / neck}). She hit me (with {her left hand / her elbow / the top of her head / a stick / a baseball}). I can {hear a piano / see the elephants in the distance [only a cloud of dust is visible]}.

The only requirement is that the active zone be associated with the nominal referent in some evident fashion. Being identical to the profiled entity and being a subpart of it are special cases of association. We easily manage the imprecision and indeterminacy inherent in profile/active-zone discrepancy. In fact, we do not even notice it. The reason is that we are able to make sense of discrepant expressions by exploiting general knowledge. For example, every expression in (3) evokes a basic scenario, a familiar aspect of everyday life in

1 For examples involving adjective + noun combinations, see Sweetser 1999.

Reference point constructions   45
our culture. This encyclopedic cultural knowledge – not any narrow, dictionary-type definitions of the component lexical items – gives us what we need to properly understand the expressions. We know that the whole cake goes in an oven, but that only part of a swan is below the surface of the water. Of course, this default knowledge can always be overridden in special contexts. If we see a swan diving to the bottom of a pond, the swan in the water would be interpreted along the lines of Figure 2.2(a), not 2.2(b).
But why does profile/active-zone discrepancy occur in the first place? It is actually both natural and often necessary from the cognitive standpoint. In many cases complete precision and accuracy in describing a relational participant is simply not possible. Discrepant expressions are natural because they profile, and thus make linguistically prominent, entities that have greater cognitive salience. Usually, for example, a whole is more salient than its parts.
Thus many expressions exhibit meanings comparable to the structure shown in Figure 2.3. The profiled relationship does not itself directly connect the entities put in profile as trajector or landmark. Rather, the directly connected enties (the shaded active zones) are either part of the profiled participant or merely associated with it. This entire configuration has the potential to be entrenched and conventional. The verb hear, for instance, has an established meaning analogous to the structure shown – it is quite usual to say things like I hear a piano.
Figure 2.3
3. Reference point constructions
In cases of profile/active-zone discrepancy, a nominal expression focuses attention on a thing, its profile, which the grammatical construction connects with the trajector or the landmark of a profiled relationship. Usually, though, the specific nature of that connection is indeterminate. The nominal profile evokes an array of associated entities, and all we know for sure is that one of those entities can supposedly be identified as a direct participant in the relationship.

46   Metonymy in grammar
But which one? This is often apparent from the content of the relational component. In (5), the verbs review and weigh respectively direct our attention to the textual and physical aspects of the book; evoking these as active zones makes the sentence coherent. Quite commonly, however, the relational element fails to resolve the indeterminacy. For instance, the sentence I like the book could equally well pertain to its content or its physical appearance. In such examples we rely on context and general knowledge. Thus in (3), it is only through standard cultural scenarios that we can determine the specific configuration most likely intended. (5) I have to review this book, which weighs 5 pounds.
Profile/active-zone discrepancy exploits our reference point ability (Langacker 1993c). This is our capacity for invoking one conceived entity as a reference point (R) in order to establish mental contact with another, i.e. to mentally access one conceived entity through another. The entity accessed in this way is called the target (T) in the reference point relationship. The set of entities accessible through a given reference point (the set of potential targets) are collectively referred to as its dominion (D). The basic elements of a reference point relationship are sketched in Figure 2.4(a). Dashed arrows indicate the path of mental access.
Figure 2.4
Figure 2.4(b) shows profile/active-zone discrepancy as a particular application of our reference point ability. Functioning as reference point is the profile of a subject or object nominal, which the construction puts in focus as trajector or landmark of a profiled relationship. By directing attention to the nominal profile we activate or make accessible an array of associated entities, which constitute the reference point’s dominion. The task is then to find a target which can serve as its active zone for participating in the profiled relationship. The active zone is usually left implicit, since it is not sought for its own sake, but only as a way of connecting the nominal referent with the profiled relationship.

Reference point constructions   47
In other cases, the kind of indeterminacy inherent in profile/active-zone discrepancy represents a construction’s basic motivation and central conceptual import. Often these constructions do not even have an explicit relational component. They are simply concerned with invoking a nominal profile in order to direct attention to another, associated entity. This target is sought for its own sake, not just as active zone for a profiled relationship. In these reference point constructions, the target is therefore made explicit, often being focused as profile, as shown in Figure 2.5.
Figure 2.5
I have argued, for example, that possessive constructions have the reference point relationship as their schematic semantic value (Langacker 1993c, 1995b; Chapter 4). While particular kinds of relationships are prototypical – notably ownership, kinship, and part-whole relations – expressions like (6) indicate that possessive constructions are extremely varied in the specific kinds of relationships they are used for. What they all have in common is merely the abstract commonality of the possessor functioning as conceptual reference point providing mental access to the entity possessed. (6) the mayor’s cellphone, Joe’s mother, my foot, the baby’s diaper, their office,
his problems, your candidate, my bus, the student’s qualifications, our displeasure, her migraine, the dog’s fleas, the bank’s current interest rate, Oswald’s assassination [of Kennedy], Kennedy’s assassination [by Oswald] The possessive morpheme ’s evokes the configuration in Figure 2.5 as its schematic meaning (Taylor 1996). When the reference point and the target are specified by the possessor nominal and the possessed noun, the full expression has the same organization and the same profiling, except that at this level the reference point is identified as a particular individual and the target as a specific instance of the type evoked by the noun, an instance identified by virtue of being located in the reference point’s dominion. Even here there is anything but complete determinacy in regard to their relationship or, as a consequence, in regard to the target’s identification. Does my foot refer to the left foot or the

48   Metonymy in grammar
right foot? Or is it even part of my own body? If I am an artist, it might be the foot that I am currently drawing. If I am a surgeon, it might be the foot that I am responsible for operating on (as opposed to the one my partner is going to operate on). My bus could be the bus I am scheduled to take, but it could also be the bus I drive, the one I designed, the one I am betting on to win the cross-country bus race, and so on indefinitely. Despite certain conventionally established defaults, the construction leaves open the precise nature of the connection between possessor and possessed. Minimally, it merely indicates that one is mentally accessible in relation to the other.
Another manifestation of reference point relationships are topic constructions, as in (7). They consist of a nominal, which functions as topic, followed by a clause which expresses a proposition somehow pertaining to the topic. When the topic and the clause are separated by an intonation break, there are two successive “windows of attention” (Chafe 1994: ch. 5; Langacker 2001b), each with its own profile: the nominal profiles a thing, and the clause a process.
(7) a. Your uncle, he really should get married. b. That color, I just don’t like it. c. The lottery, I never have any luck.
To say that the clause “pertains to” the topic means that the proposition it expresses fits somewhere in the body of knowledge evoked by the topic nominal. Thus we can characterize the nominal profile as a reference point, the associated body of knowledge as the dominion accessible through it, and the proposition as a target, i.e. as one element in the reference point’s dominion. This is shown in Figure 2.6. If the proposition is “about” the topic, the nominal referent must somehow figure in the proposition expressed by the target clause. It has some role in this proposition, usually indicated in English by means of a coreferential pronoun, like he in (7)a and it in (7)b. In diagram (a), a small circle represents the nominal referent in its role in the clausal proposition (coreference is shown as a dotted correspondence line).
Figure 2.6

Reference point constructions   49

In many languages, the topic construction does not include a resumptive pronoun. Occasionally this happens in English, e.g. (7)c. There is then no way to be sure what role the topic plays in the proposition, only that it has some role, possibly quite peripheral. This is shown in Figure 2.6(b). Such expressions are indeterminate in regard to how the topic and the clause are connected, and where the proposition fits in the topic’s dominion. There is often a default, supplied by context or general knowledge. Thus (7)c would normally mean that I never have any luck at winning the lottery. But given appropriate circumstances, it might instead mean that I never have any luck in getting the winner of the lottery to marry me, or in running it successfully.
Closely related to topic constructions are the double subject constructions found in many languages. The examples in (8) are from Japanese:

(8) a. Taroo-ga fuku-ga itsumo hade-da. ‘Taro always has gaudy clothes.’ 		 Taro-s clothes-s always gaudy-be

b. Rokugatsu-ga ame-ga yoku   furu. ‘June always has a lot of rain.’ 		 June-s     rain-s     often fall

c. Kono koosokudooro-ga ookuno torakku-ga tooru.

		 this freeway-s

many truck-s pass

		 ‘This freeway has many trucks pass on it.’

Like topic constructions, these sentences consist of a nominal followed by a clause. They differ from a standard topic construction in that the entire expression constitutes a single, higher-level clause, which incorporates the lower-level clause as one component. What happens in a double subject construction is that the two elements of a topic construction – nominal and clause – are incorporated as trajector and landmark of a profiled relationship that is not explicitly indicated by any verb. As shown in Figure 2.7, this relationship is nothing other than the reference point relation responsible for the trajector’s topic status with respect to the lower-level clause.2 Most relevant here is the absence of any explicit indication of the role played by the subject/topic nominal in the target proposition, expressed by the lower-level clause. The precise connection between topic and proposition has to be supplied on the basis of context or general knowledge.

2 Evidence for this analysis (justified more fully in Kumashiro and Langacker 2003) includes the absence of an intonation break after the first nominal, suggesting that the entire expression indeed constitutes a single clause, as well as the fact that the first nominal can take the subject marker -ga.

4. Complex things and relationships Many expressions pertain to collections of entities, or to single, higher-order entities clearly recognized as consisting of individual elements. These complex entities are a major source of indeterminacy. Plural nouns are an obvious example. When a plural specifies the trajector or the landmark of a relational expression, there is usually some indeterminacy as to how the profiled relationship engages the complex entity.
In some cases, a default interpretation follows from a predicate’s meaning. For instance, the adjectives in (9) induce the respective interpretations in Figure 2.8. Intelligent ascribes to its trajector a property that is usually characteristic of individuals. Barring special circumstances, (9)a implies that each woman individually displays a certain property (represented as a box), that of intelligence. Thus the profiled adjectival relationship comprises multiple atomic relationships, each projecting to a single woman. On the other hand, the property of being numerous can only be ascribed to a set of entities viewed collectively, as a single but complex whole. So (9)b implies only one atomic relationship. (9) a. Those women are intelligent.
b. The problems with that idea are numerous.
Figure 2.8

Complex things and relationships   51
Yet many predicates fail to impose a default interpretation. One of these is heavy, as in (10), which can easily be interpreted along the lines of either 2.8(a) or 2.8(b). That is, the property of being heavy can plausibly be ascribed to each box individually, or to all the boxes taken collectively. (10) These boxes are heavy. With multiple plural participants, the indeterminacy is often much greater. For instance, sentence (11) has an open-ended set of significantly different interpretations, a few of which are diagrammed in Figure 2.9. (11) The two men lifted the two boxes.
Figure 2.9
One interpretation, represented in diagram (a), is that the two men, acting together, lifted the two boxes together. Hence there is only one atomic event of lifting, in which both the men and the boxes participate collectively. Alternatively, each man may have lifted a single box, implying two atomic events, as shown in (b). Another possibility, shown in (c), is that each man individually lifted the two boxes together. Or conversely, the men may have collectively lifted each box individually, as in (d). It is also conceivable that one man lifted one box, while the other lifted both boxes, as in (e). Or conversely once more, one box was lifted by a single man and the other by both men, as in (f). Yet another option, shown in (g), adds to (f) a further atomic event in which the men jointly lift the boxes together. Other possibilities are easily imagined. In sum, all we know for sure is that lifting was done and that two men and two boxes were somehow involved as agents and patients. We do not know how many atomic events there might have been, nor how any such event projects to the individuals subsumed by the subject and object nominals. I have tried to indicate this indeterminacy in diagram (h).

52   Metonymy in grammar
English verbs and adjectives give no morphological indication of whether they profile a single, atomic relationship or a complex relationship consisting of multiple atomic ones. The singular/plural contrast induced by so-called “verb agreement” does not itself indicate the number of atomic relationships, as we see in (9), where the plural form are occurs with both configurations. Nor does the verb mechanically agree with the subject. Rather, the verb inflection makes an independent semantic contribution (Reid 1991; Barlow 1992), emphasizing either the trajector’s unitary nature or its internal multiplicity. This specification encourages a corresponding construal of the profiled relationship as being either simple or complex, but does not strictly determine that choice.
Exemplified in (12) are three kinds of nominal expressions displaying this ambivalence. The collective noun faculty lends itself to either of two construals: as a deliberative body capable of joint decisions; or as a set of individuals who make individual decisions. While in either case the subject in (12)a profiles a collective entity consisting of all faculty members, the choice of singular has vs. plural have indicates which aspect of its decision-making capacity engages the profiled process of acceptance. The contrast in (12)b hinges on whether drinking and smoking are seen as two distinct vices, each of which fails individually to improve one’s health, or whether they are construed as two facets of a single unhealthy behavioral complex. And in (12)c, the flying is attributable to either the individual geese or the flock as a whole. Obviously, a flock can fly only by virtue of its individual members doing so, but we can opt to highlight either the individual or the collective aspect of the motion.
(12) a. The faculty {has / have} accepted the new curriculum. b. Drinking and smoking {does / do} not improve your health. c. A flock of geese {was / were} flying overhead.
By emphasizing the trajector’s unitary or multiplex nature, the verb inflection in (12) gives an indication of how the subject links up with the profiled clausal relationship. The subject nominal does not itself impose a choice, for with either construal its has the same form and the same grammatical structure (i.e. there is no difference in component elements, correspondences, or constituency). It is therefore indeterminate how the nominal referent engages the profiled relationship when there happens not to be any verb inflection to indicate it:
(13) a. The new curriculum has been accepted by the faculty. b. Drinking and smoking will not improve your health. c. We saw a flock of geese flying overhead.
With respect to (12)c, a flock and the geese constituting it are coextensive and referentially identical. Yet flock is a count noun, and geese a plural mass

Complex things and relationships   53
noun. What about the subject nominal as a whole? Objectively, it has the same profile with either the unitary or the multiplex construal – in either case it refers to the same set of objects. Conceptually, however, a unitary entity like a flock, a stack, or a week is just as real to us – just as much a single, bounded object – as is a goose, a plate, or a day. We can thus say that a flock of geese has two alternate profiles. It can either designate the flock, construed as a single, discretely bounded entity, or else the mass coextensive with (and delimited by) that entity. These two options are respectively shown in Figure 2.10(a) and (b), using circles for intrinsically bounded entities and an ellipse for a mass (where bounding is extrinsic). The small circles represent geese, the large one a flock. The ellipse represents a mass consisting of geese. The construction tells us that this mass is limited in extent – specifically, it is coextensive with the flock (the double line indicates their coincidence).
Figure 2.10
Hence the nominal profile can fall on either of two conceived entities that are objectively coincident. Depending on whether it is construed as designating the referent’s unitary or multiplex aspect, it is compatible with either a uniplex or a multiplex interpretation of fly, as shown in the diagram by arrows. But since fly itself is morphologically the same under either interpretation, the choice between 2.10(a) and (b) is indeterminate unless verb inflection should happen to indicate how its trajector is construed.
I want to emphasize that, in CG terms, this is not a matter of how the nominal is put together syntactically. Under either interpretation, the phrase flock of geese consists of the same elements, connected by the same correspondences, and with the same constituency.3 The difference is solely a matter of which aspect of the referent is singled out for profiling at the composite structure level. The variation is not a problem in CG, for there is no requirement that the composite structure inherit its profile from any particular structural position. The alternate interpretations can be seen as an instance of metonymy in a fairly narrow sense of the term (shift in profile).
3 This is discussed more fully in Chapter 3. (See also Langacker 1992a, 1997a.)

54   Metonymy in grammar
If a flock of geese is multifaceted, a barrel of oil is even more so. First, a barrel of oil exhibits a contrast analogous to that observed for a flock of geese, whereby it designates either the container or its contents. But barrel also functions as a unit of measurement, in which case there need be no physical container at all. There are thus a number of possibilities as to the referent and how it engages a profiled relationship, and particular examples may be indeterminate in either respect.
Certain points will emerge more clearly if we shift to the plural. Consider, then, the various ways of interpreting the phrase three barrels of oil. We can start with cases where the primary focus is on the plural mass consisting of physical containers. Here there are two basic possibilities with respect to how the profiled mass engages a relationship: the barrels can participate in the relationship either collectively or individually. In (14)a, the predicate stacked imposes a collective construal, while in (14)b sit suggests an individual construal, as respectively shown in diagrams (a) and (b) of Figure 2.11. But in other examples the connection is indeterminate. One can see three barrels of oil individually or collectively, and one can load them in either fashion (e.g. by rolling them individually or by lifting them together with a crane).
(14) a. Three barrels of oil were stacked in the basement. b. Three barrels of oil were sitting in the basement. c. I saw three barrels of oil on the truck. d. They loaded three barrels of oil onto the truck.
Figure 2.11
In other uses, focus shifts to the oil contained in the barrels, which can still be construed as physical entities actually holding the substance. An example is (15), where only the oil itself participates in the burning, as sketched in Figure 2.12. Note, however, that in the subordinate clause we can construe the relative pronoun which as referring to either the oil or to the barrels per se. This shows how easily we can shift back and forth between two construals of the same situation coded by the same expression with the same grammatical

Complex things and relationships   55
structure. Even when which refers anaphorically to three barrels of oil, where the substance is in focus, it can itself be taken as indicating the containers. Participation in different relationships evokes different facets of this complex entity. (15) To heat our house last winter we burned the three barrels of oil which
had been sitting in the basement for several years.
Figure 2.12
Figures 2.11 and 2.12 characterize the alternate ways of construing three barrels of oil in terms of a difference in profiling: [three barrels [of oil]] vs. [three barrels [of oil]]. This contrast is orthogonal to another one, namely whether barrel is taken as designating a physical container or a unit of measurement. In the latter sense, metonymically related to the first, it profiles the volume defined by a barrel’s interior. As such, it is typically conceived in relation to a scale for measuring quantity in terms of this volumetric unit. While the notion of a physical container is still evoked to some degree, no actual container need be involved. Physical containers figure in the conception of the scale only as virtual entities in terms of their potential for holding a given quantity.
In (16), three barrels of oil does not refer directly to either oil or physical barrels. While these are certainly part of the background conception, what the expression actually designates is a volumetric quantity. Thus, as shown in Figure 2.13, these expressions invoke a scale for measuring volume, where the basic unit of measurement is the volume defined by a barrel. Since this is true in both (16)a and (16)b, which are otherwise identical, what could be responsible for the contrast between the plural verb are in (16)a and the singular is in (16) b? The difference, indicated in the diagrams, is whether the profiled quantity is primarily conceived as a set of volumetric units or as a point on the scale they serve to calibrate. The latter construal emerges as the association with physical barrels recedes further into the background. (16) a. Three barrels of oil are equivalent to 126 gallons.
b. Three barrels of oil is equivalent to 126 gallons.

56   Metonymy in grammar
Figure 2.13
This metonymic shift from set of units to location on a scale represents a general pattern, observed with many other kinds of units and scales, exemplified in (17). They vary as to whether the set interpretation is still accessible. (17) a. Eleven days in Cairo {was / were} more than we had planned on.
b. For this recipe two cups of flour {is / are} enough. c. Thirty degrees {is / *are} a big difference in temperature. d. Fourteen dollars {was / *were} a lot to pay for that. Finally, we see from the anaphoric pronouns in (18) that three barrels of oil can also be construed as either singular or plural in cases where it designates the oil and where the barrels once again are units of measurement (pipe in rules out their interpretation as physical containers). The constrast, sketched in Figure 2.14, is a matter of whether the oil is conceived as the union of three barrel-sized portions or simply as an undifferentiated mass corresponding to three units on the scale of measurement. (18) a. We piped in three barrels of oil, but they ran out, so we had to pipe in
another. b. We piped in three barrels of oil and burned it over the winter.
Figure 2.14

Other phenomena   57
These subtly different ways of interpreting three barrels of oil have very real grammatical consequences. They determine such factors as singular vs. plural verb inflection, selection of co-referring pronoun, and which predicates the expression can combine with. It would be quite implausible (and certainly gratuitous) to suppose that each interpretation is uniquely associated with a distinct grammatical structure. I suspect that three barrels of oil is put together grammatically in the same way for all the interpretations considered, the sole differences residing in the choice of composite structure profile. Commonly, though, there is nothing that forces a single, unique construal. In view of these multiple options, metonymically related to one another, the specific nature of the nominal’s grammatical connection with other elements is often indeterminate. The nominal evokes a complex conceptualization with a number of profiling options. In effect, its occurrence in a particular grammatical construction merely tells us to hook it up in any way that makes sense.
5. Other phenomena
Indeterminacy can be observed in many other grammatical phenomena. Let me mention just a few by way of conclusion.
There is often indeterminacy in regard to how an adverbial expression hooks up with a clause in which it has a modifying function. A case in point is the trajector of on in (19). What specifically is it that is conceived as being on the door? It can hardly be the entire event – the door’s surface is not the global setting for my pounding. Nor is it me, at least not all of me, for only my fist makes contact with the door. Intuitively, I am inclined to identify the trajector of on as being the blow or the force transmitted. In any case the point of connection is vague or indeterminate. Descriptively, I would probably take the verb pound as being the trajector of on the door, without specifying any particular active zone for its participation in the on relationship. The point of connection is sublexical, an aspect of the scene not individually singled out for explicit mention.
(19) I pounded on the door.
Various sorts of indeterminacy figure in anaphora, e.g. the connection between a personal pronoun and its antecedent. This is another kind of reference point relationship (van Hoek 1995, 1997). The antecedent nominal establishes its referent as a reference point whose dominion is some portion of the ongoing discourse. Within this stretch of discourse, it provides the basis for determining the reference of a pronoun, which is thus a target in the sense that the

58   Metonymy in grammar
intended referent is mentally accessible via the antecedent. This relationship is usually independent of any particular structural configuration. The antecedent can lie at some distance from the pronoun, in a wide variety of structural positions with respect to it. At the most schematic level, we merely know that a pronoun’s reference can be ascertained because it occurs in the dominion of a nominal serving as reference point for its interpretation.
There is further indeterminacy when a pronoun lacks an explicit nominal antecedent. In some cases the intended referent is not mentioned explicitly, but is evident from the discourse context (Hankamer and Sag 1976). Alternatively, the referent may be accessible metonymically, as in (20), from Japanese (Yamanashi 2003; Langacker 1996). The pronoun sore refers to the food in the bowl, but only the bowl is mentioned directly. Of course, many languages carry indeterminacy one step further by not even using a pronoun in certain circumstances. A vacant argument slot can be just as effective as a pronoun in prompting the search for a referent. And despite the indeterminacy, we usually manage to find the intended referent in the discourse or the context of speech. The referent is commonly the speaker or the hearer, since these are always accessible in the discourse context to serve as point of connection. In (20), the main clause trajector is left implicit but is understood by default as being the speaker.
(20) Donburi-ga  detekita  node, suguni  sore-o tabeta. bowl-s	  served  since  instantly it-o ate ‘As soon as the bowl was served, I ate it [the food].’
Yet another kind of indeterminacy in pronominal reference is actual vagueness as to the intended referent (Gensler 1977; Chapter 5). Especially with the pronoun it, there are times when even the speaker – though clearly referring to something – would not be able to say just what. Suppose, for example, that a teenage girl is denied permission to go to the movies with her boyfriend. One can imagine her protesting to her parents by saying It’s just not fair!. What does the pronoun it refer to in this context? The decision? The fact that permission was denied? The prospect of staying home on Friday night? The general circumstances? The misery of being a teenager? The plight of not being in control of her life? All of these? Some combination of them? In all likelihood the speaker has no single, precisely delimited referent in mind. This vagueness of reference is not however the same as absence of reference.
A final example concerns the internal structure of nominal expressions. In (21), there is indeterminacy as to how the definite article the and the quantifier four connect with the remainder of the nominal, which singles out a type of thing as the entity being identified or quantified.

Other phenomena   59
(21) a. The [hard-working [Japanese]] have achieved prosperity. b. She has four [brilliant [students]].
The definite article indicates that a single instance of the specified type is uniquely identifiable in the current discourse context. But what is that type? In (21)a it can either be Japanese or hard-working Japanese. In the former case, the set of Japanese as an undifferentiated whole offers itself as the obvious unique instance of this plural type. The adjective hard-working does not itself contribute to characterizing the type in question. It does however contribute in the second interpretation, where only those Japanese who are hard-working are said to have achieved prosperity. Depending on whether or not the adjective contributes to characterizing the specified type, it is sometimes described as being used either “restrictively” or “non-restrictively” (by analogy to relative clauses). In the CG account, this is simply a matter of which type specification potentially available within the nominal is put in correspondence with the type invoked by the article.
Likewise, four evokes a plural type and indicates the size of a set constituting one instance of it. In (21)b the type in question can either be just students (in which case she only has four, all of whom are brilliant) or else brilliant students (in which case she probably has additional students of lesser caliber). This is not a structural difference in the sense of there being different constituency or constituents representing different categories. It is simply a matter of how the component elements are connected by correspondences, in this case at the type level. But despite its non-structural nature, the contrast is still in the realm of grammar. In the CG perspective, grammar is nothing more than assemblies of symbolic structures linked by correspondences. Neither the indeterminacy of many connections nor the conceptual nature of the elements connected offers any basis for claiming that the phenomena at issue are semantic rather than grammatical or pragmatic rather than semantic.
These examples could be multiplied indefinitely. The indeterminacy they manifest is not in any way atypical, even in “core” areas of grammar. They demand a revision in what traditionally has been the default conception of grammatical structure, as well as a theoretical perspective in which they are seen as natural rather than problematic. A perspective of this kind is available in CG, set in the broader context of cognitive linguistics.

Chapter 3 A constructional approach to grammaticization
If grammaticization is characterized as the evolution of grammatical elements from lexical sources, it is with the understanding that the locus of change is an encompassing construction. For instance, the source of future gonna is not the verb go by itself, but the entire be going to construction, involving the progressive and an infinitival purpose clause. Ideally, a complete account of grammaticization must therefore include a description of the construction at various evolutionary stages, from source to end result.
From a cognitive-functional perspective, one should not expect to find a specific number of distinct historical stages occurring in a strictly determined sequence. Nor should one expect the situation at a given stage to be simple and clear-cut. Both meanings and constructions are complex and multifaceted. Certain aspects of their characterization, and the changes affecting them, are matters of degree. And at any one time, a language exhibits competing analyses as well as variants representing multiple diachronic stages (Heine 1992). Dealing with these complexities, either synchronically or diachronically, requires a constructional, usage based framework (Barlow and Kemmer 2000; Langacker 2000).
Still, it all starts with the description of particular constructions, characterized in CG as assemblies of symbolic structures, i.e. form-meaning pairings (Chapter 1). To describe a construction fully, one has to specify: (i) the meaning of each component element; (ii) how these meanings are integrated to form composite conceptions at different levels of organization; and (iii) how the construction relates to others (its position in intersecting networks of constructions and constructional variants). I will illustrate these factors and their interaction by examining the quantifying expression a lot of (Langacker To appear b).
1. The source construction
Superficially, expressions of the form a lot of X are parallel to nominals like a woman from Brazil, consisting of a determiner, a head noun, and a modifying prepositional phrase. Presumably the source structure instantiated some variant of this construction. The example is analyzed in Figure 3.1, on the assumption (which is not essential) that the article and noun form a constituent. The article is a grounding element, i.e. it specifies the discourse status of the

The source construction   61
nominal referent vis-à-vis the ground (G), comprising the speech event and its participants (Langacker 2004c). Heavy lines indicate that woman and Brazil profile (i.e. designate) things, while from profiles a relationship whose trajector (tr) and landmark (lm) – its primary and secondary focal participants – are also things. Dotted lines represent the correspondences which specify how component elements are integrated to form composite conceptions at successively higher levels of organization.
Figure 3.1
If Figure 3.1 approximates the source construction, in terms of grammatical organization, the end result of grammaticization is likely to be a simple quantifying construction, analogous to the one with many and much. At least in certain contexts, a lot of appears to be winning the competition with many, as seen in (1)a, and has largely supplanted much, as in (1)b. (1) a. We ate {a lot of / ?many} cookies.
b. We drank {a lot of / ??much} milk. The basic construction with many or much is sketched in Figure 3.2(a). I will use an ellipse (as opposed to a circle) to represent a mass, be it plural (as with cookies) or non-plural (as with milk). The quantifier profiles a mass characterized only as surpassing the norm (n) on a scale of magnitude. The construction simply identifies that mass with the one profiled by the noun, so the composite expression designates a quantified mass of the type it specifies (given as X). Structure (a) instantiates the constructional schema in (b), which is the same except that it abstracts away from the specification of any particular quantity.

62   A constructional approach to grammaticization

Figure 3.2

I have shown the quantifier as a grounding element, a point which requires elaboration. In and of themselves, many and much are not grounding elements, but absolute quantifiers (Langacker 1991: § 2.3.2) which profile relationships (cf. Our problems are many; The many problems we face). Most typically, however, such quantifiers occur in nominals grounded by zero, the unmarked option for indefinite mass nouns. The quantifier depicted in Figure 3.2 represents the conflation of the quantifying and zero grounding functions; this should probably be regarded as a derived value of such quantifiers. Their status as nominal grounding elements is most evident in expressions that lack a lexical head (e.g. Many were broken).
If a lot of X starts out with a structure analogous to Figure 3.1, and winds up with one like Figure 3.2, where a lot of is reduced to a monomorphemic quantifier, what are the stages connecting them? What happens to the article and preposition, which are not preserved as separate elements? Where are we now in this overall development? For the reasons cited above, I would not posit a specific sequence of stages that are well-defined and discretely different. It need not be the case, for instance, that changes affecting the article and the preposition occur in any particular order. Nor does the situation at any one stage necessarily reduce to a single, consistent analysis. I suspect that in alotta uses a lot of is not too far removed from being analyzed as a monomorphemic quantifier, as in Figure 3.2. But at the same time (right now, that is) various phenomena indicate a coexisting analysis closer to the one in Figure 3.1. In other words, there still exists an analysis with the constituency in Figure 3.1, where a, lot, and of retain their identities as article, noun, and preposition.

(2) a. [ [ a lot ] [ of X ] ]

b. [ alotta X ]

		  art n   p  nml	   qnt  n

The source construction   63

So if (2)a is developing into (2)b, this process has not yet run its course. Evidence for the persistence of (2)a includes the existence of the variants in (3). The sequence a lot – not alotta – occurs in anaphoric and adverbial uses. We find the reinforced variant a whole lot, just as with nouns like pile, flock, bunch, etc. Suggesting the continued status of a lot as a singular count noun with an indefinite article is the expected plural lots. Beyond this, there may still be some connection with expressions like those in (3)d, where lot retains the original meaning ‘group/collection’.

(3) a. b. c. d.

We ate a lot.		

(*We ate alotta.)

a whole lot of X		

(a whole {pile / flock / bunch} of X)

lots of X			

({tons / scads / oodles} of X; a ton ~ tons)

They’re a sorry lot. We should get rid of the lot of them.

Thus a lot of belongs to a family of expressions all of which support the analysis in (2)a. One could argue, of course, that the connections among them are rather tenuous, hardly sufficient to prevent its reanalysis as (2)b. And indeed, I do not doubt that (2)b is emerging. Nonetheless, additional evidence based on grammatical behavior all points to (2)a as the primary analysis, or at least one that is still accessible. One difference between (2)a and (2)b is that X is a full nominal (i.e. a noun phrase) in the former, but simply a noun in the latter. The distinction is not always evident with indefinites, due to the option of zero grounding. X can however be definite, as in (4), which argues for (2)a:

(4) a. a lot of them				 b. a lot of that cherry-flavored whisky 						
Expressions like (5) also require this analysis:

(*many them) (*much that cherry-flavored whisky)

(5) They have a lot – maybe even a whole collection – of impressionist paintings.

Further supporting (2)a is the possibility of preposing the prepositional phrase, as in (6)a:

(6) a.
b. c.

(i) Of that I have a lot.

(ii) That’s something of which I have a

lot.

(i) That I have a lot of.

(ii) That’s something I have a lot of.

(i) That song I know the words to.(ii) That’s a song I know the words

to.

To be sure, of can also be left behind, as in (6)b. But that merely illustrates the phenomenon known as “preposition stranding”, as in (6)c.

64   A constructional approach to grammaticization
2. Component meanings
How, then, are expressions like (2)a put together? The first task is to specify the meanings of lot and of.1 The sense of lot that concerns us is the one manifested in expressions that instantiate the general pattern in (7), i.e. expressions of the form a N of X, where N is the noun in question and X describes a mass (plural or non-plural). This represents a special case of the pattern in Figure 3.1, distinguished by several properties: (i) the preposition is of; (ii) X is a mass term; and (iii) the referents of N and X are coextensive. Their coextension can be of different sorts. With nouns like box and barrel, N is a container and X the content which fills it. Nouns like pile and stack designate a bounded entity characterized by its spatial configuration, X being the constitutive mass which assumes that configuration. Nouns like flock and collection are similar, except that they are non-specific about spatial configuration, placing more emphasis on the collective function of the constitutive entities. And nouns like ton, yard, and gallon are units of measurement, used to assess the extension of X along some scale.
(7) a N of X: a box of nails; a barrel of oil; a pile of dirt; a stack of plates; a flock of sheep; a collection of paintings; a ton of coal; a yard of fabric; a gallon of milk
These types of noun differ in the extent to which N exists independently of X. I roughly describe them in (8), without pretending that the list is exhaustive or that the types are sharply distinct or non-overlapping (e.g. flock is intermediate between configurational and group nouns). A container is a distinct physical object that exists independently of its content. Configurations and groups may be physical, but they are not distinct from their constitutive entities – they are coextensive with them in the strongest sense. A unit of measure per se is non-physical, consisting in extension along a scale; it is physically manifested only as an aspect of what it measures.
(8) a.	Container (box, barrel): physical object; distinct from content; has a shape; has a containing function.
b.	Configuration (pile, stack): physical; not distinct from constitutive entities; has a shape; has no specific function.
c.	Group (flock, collection): not necessarily physical; not distinct from constitutive entities; has no specific shape; has a particular function.
d.	Measure (ton, yard, gallon): non-physical (scalar); physically manifested only as an aspect of constitutive entities; has no shape (only extension along a scale); has a measurement function.
1 The meaning of a will be considered later.

Component meanings   65
In Figure 3.3 I offer diagrammatic representations for these types of nouns. I am using a circle to indicate a bounded entity (corresponding to count nouns) and an ellipse for a mass (not inherently construed as bounded). A container noun profiles a bounded object distinct from a mass that fills it. I make no diagrammatic distinction between a configuration and a group, which are alike in that the bounded entity they profile is indistinguishable from the mass which constitutes it; I use two lines (like an equal sign) to represent this strong coextensiveness. Finally, a measure noun designates a bounded entity consisting only of some extension along a scale, corresponding to one facet of what is measured (such as weight, area, or volume).

Figure 3.3

As noted in Chapter 2, a particular expression of the form a N of X may have multiple specific interpretations, and a particular N may have multiple conventionally established senses. We see in (9), for instance, that the composite expression a barrel of oil can designate either the container, its content, a mass equivalent in volume to its content, or a unit of measurement pure and simple. As for barrel itself, its established meanings include at least the container sense and the unit of measurement sense.

(9) a. They rolled a barrel of oil down the ramp.	    [container]

b.	We burned a barrel of oil that had been sitting in the basement.

					

[content]

c. A barrel of oil leaked from the storage tank.   [measured mass]

d. A barrel of oil is 42 gallons.		   [unit of measurement]

Container, configuration, and group nouns can all develop into measure nouns, as observed in (10). The original meaning can be retained, and may even still be primary, as in the case of cup. Container nouns seem especially prone to this development, probably because containers usually have a fairly specific size. The configuration noun bunch figures in the quantifying expres-

66   A constructional approach to grammaticization
sion a bunch of X, which rivals a lot of X for its prevalence and degree of grammaticization. As for lot, the group noun sense still exists, if only marginally. (10) a. (i) The cup broke.   (ii) This recipe calls for a cup of blueberries.
b. (i) He bought a large bunch of grapes.   (ii) He owns a bunch of hotels. c.	The auction started well. Every item in the first lot attracted a lot of
bidders. The development of a measure sense is sketched in Figure 3.4. At the initial stage, the noun profiles a container, configuration, or group per se; while it may have a typical size, this is not a central semantic specification. But since it designates a bounded entity, it serves a unitizing function with respect to a mass by delimiting the portion that is coextensive with it. This gives it the potential to serve a quantifying function, where the size of an instance is measured in terms of the units thus defined. Employing the noun in this fashion heightens the salience of its size specification. Moreover, through the kind of phrasal metonymy exemplified in (9)b–c, it might be used for a unit of mass whose association with the container, configuration, or group is merely recalled or imagined. This interpretation is sketched in diagram (b). The measure sense results from a shift in profile (metonymy) whereby the noun specifically designates the unit of measurement (extension along a scale), association with a container, configuration, or group receding into the background. Eventually this association may disappear altogether.
Figure 3.4
The lot that appears in a lot of X at least approximates this final stage. In contrast to barrel, flock, and even bunch, it does not at all evoke the conception of a bounded entity coextensive with the quantified mass. It is not entirely clear why lot has evolved to indicate a large quantity rather than a small one. Presumably this reflects an original emphasis on the constitutive entities being exhaustive of the group defined for a certain purpose. Be that as it may, I will take diagram (d) as representing the sense of lot in a lot of X. As a pure measure expression, it lends itself to adverbial uses, where it does not quantify a mass but rather the intensity or frequency of a process: I like it a lot; She complains a lot (cf. He hit it a ton).

Component meanings   67
The uses and senses of the preposition of are too complex to examine here in any detail. As a schematic characterization, I have suggested (Langacker 1992a) that of profiles an intrinsic relationship between its trajector and landmark. For describing a lot of X and related expressions, we can focus on two particular kinds of intrinsic relationship: that in which the trajector is a restricted subpart of the landmark, as exemplified in (11)a, and that in which the trajector and landmark are coextensive, as in (11)b.
(11) a.	Restricted subpart: the back of my hand; the center of the room; most of the elephants; a portion of the rice; the first chapter of his thesis; the roof of that house; two of those packages; a bite of this pizza; the surface of the moon; the floor of the closet
b.	Coextension: a line of posts; a bar of soap; a can of soup; a mound of dirty clothes; a grove of orange trees; a herd of cattle; an array of sensors; a house of straw; the state of California; the mystery of his disappearance; that idiot of a president
Though seemingly at odds with one another, these two senses are related to one another in various ways, the first being their common status as types of intrinsic relationship. For each sense, a plausible path of evolution can be suggested starting with the original meaning ‘from’. That, however, is well beyond the scope of this analysis. A further connection is that coextension represents the limiting case of a restricted subpart: the case that emerges when the degree of the trajector’s restrictiveness vis-à-vis the landmark falls to zero (cf. Langacker 1982). Finally, I note that many uses are ambivalent between the two senses, both being observable in the overall situation. Consider a slice of cake. The overall expression may be interpreted as profiling the bounded entity slice (N), as shown in Figure 3.5(c). But what about cake (X)? Does it refer to the larger mass from which the slice is taken, as in 3.5(a)? Or just to the portion which constitutes the slice, as in 3.5(b)? It may be possible to force a particular interpretation, e.g. by using an overtly grounded nominal object which clearly designates a larger whole: a slice of that cake which you baked last night. But often the matter is indeterminate.
Figure 3.5

68   A constructional approach to grammaticization 3. Integration Having considered the meanings of the component elements, we can now describe their integration to form composite conceptions at different levels of organization. For sake of comparison, we can usefully start with expressions that have not grammaticized to the same extent as a lot of X. Consider the phrase a flock of those sheep, which might occur in the context of (12). The context makes it clear that the referent of flock (N) is only a portion of the mass designated by the prepositional object those sheep (X). The expression then has the structure sketched in Figure 3.6. (12) The sheep you imported from New Zealand are getting to be a problem.
A flock of those sheep is messing up my lawn.
Figure 3.6
The noun flock, grounded by the indefinite article, profiles a bounded entity which is coextensive (in the strong sense) with a plural mass. Of profiles the relationship which a proper subpart bears to a whole. Its landmark is elaborated by the nominal those sheep (grounded by the demonstrative) to form a prepositional phrase, which therefore designates the relationship that a restricted mass of sheep bears to a more inclusive mass. At the higher level of organization, the

Integration   69
schematic mass delimited by flock is put in correspondence with the trajector of the prepositional phrase (the usual configuration in a modifying construction). Hence the composite structure profiles a flock consisting of sheep drawn from a larger mass of sheep.2
Since a group and its constitutive entities are strongly coextensive, it is hardly surprising that expressions like a flock of those sheep are sometimes interpreted as referring not to the group per se but rather to the plural mass it comprises. Indicating this metonymic shift is the plural verb in (13), in contrast to the singular verb in (12). When interpreted in this manner, the expression has the structure shown in Figure 3.7.3 It is just the same as Figure 3.6 except for the composite structure profile. Note that this constructional variant is exocentric, as the composite structure profile is not the same as that of either component structure. While the two analyses are very similar, the difference between them is grammatically significant – depending on the choice of profile, the composite expression is either a count noun (hence the verb is) or a plural mass noun (hence the verb are). Expressions like a flock of those sheep are thus susceptible to alternative analyses which compete with one another. It is not always evident which analysis is intended, or whether the speaker is even making the distinction. In the absence of verb agreement (e.g. A flock of those sheep would mess up my lawn) the matter may simply be indeterminate. (13) A flock of those sheep are messing up my lawn.
Figure 3.7
2 I have not shown the internal structure of those sheep, nor am I making any notational distinction among the various kinds of nominal grounding.
3 Only the highest level of organization is indicated.

70   A constructional approach to grammaticization
There is also competition between alternative analyses along another dimension. To force the restricted subpart interpretation, I had to construct the context in (12) and use a demonstrative to ground the prepositional object. It is far more typical in expressions of this sort for the prepositional object to be a simple noun, e.g. a flock of sheep. Of course, due to the option of zero grounding a plural or non-plural mass noun may itself constitute a full, grounded nominal, hence able to function as a subject or object. The instance it designates can be of any size relative to the maximal extension of the type. The profiled instance may be contextually delimited (as in I saw sheep on the lawn), or it may be unrestricted, in which case the profiled instance is equivalent to the maximal extension (e.g. I hate sheep).
So in the expression a flock of sheep, it is still possible to analyze sheep as a full, grounded nominal. Here too it might be interpreted as designating a larger mass (perhaps the maximal extension of the type) from which the flock is drawn. If so, a flock of sheep has the analyses in Figures 3.6 and 3.7, differing from them only in how the prepositional object is grounded. But since a zero-grounded mass can be of any size, we have another option (just as with a slice of cake): instead of designating a more inclusive mass, sheep can also be interpreted as designating the very instance of the type which constitutes the flock. In this case of is understood as indicating coextension (rather than a restricted subpart relation), as in (11)b and Figure 3.5(b). There may be no direct way to detect the difference. Indeed, in a previous description (Langacker To appear b) I adopted the analysis in Figures 3.6 and 3.7 precisely in order to accommodate examples with a definite determiner, like a flock of those sheep. But there is no real reason to suppose that a flock of sheep and a flock of those sheep have to be parallel in all respects. Given the prevalence of competing analyses and coexisting variants, it seems quite reasonable to suppose that the interpretive possibilities afforded by zero grounding allow the emergence of an alternative analysis in which the component elements are integrated in a different fashion. It is a tighter integration, in accordance with a general tendency for grammaticization to correlate with a higher degree of conceptual overlap (Langacker 1992b, 2003c).
Since the meaning of flock involves coextension, which dovetails with a central sense of of, interpreting of in this manner is natural if not inevitable. Expressions like a flock of those sheep, which specifically invoke a larger mass, seem rather marginal and require more contextual support. I take them as representing a constructional variant that is now secondary but still available when need arises. For expressions like a flock of sheep, with zero grounding, the interpretation based on coextension is now (I presume) the default. With this analysis as well we have the option of profiling either the flock or the sheep which constitute it, as reflected in the choice of is vs. are in (14).

Integration   71 (14) A flock of sheep {is / are} grazing on my lawn.
In Figure 3.8, I show this default analysis under the second option, where a flock of sheep designates the sheep.4 The indefinite nominal sheep profiles a plural mass which might be of any size. It specifies the landmark of the preposition of, which profiles a relationship of coextension. At the higher level of organization, that relationship is identified with the one inherent in the meaning of flock: its trajector corresponds to the flock per se, its landmark to the mass which constitutes it. At the composite structure level, therefore, these two relationships of coextension collapse into one: they are two encodings of the same relationship.5 In this way the referent of sheep is delimited and bounded by flock.
Figure 3.8
Tighter integration – reflected in multiple correspondences and a greater degree of conceptual overlap – is characteristic of more highly grammaticized expressions. The type of overlap in Figure 3.8 represents a step in the evolution

5 One could say that they are themselves coextensive.

72   A constructional approach to grammaticization
of a lot of in the direction of being a monomorphemic quantifier. But we are not there yet. If the end result will be something like (2)b, the structure in (2)a is still alive and well. Indeed, a lot of X still allows the restricted subpart interpretation, where X is a full, grounded nominal that designates a larger mass from which the quantified mass is drawn. Thus (15)a is analogous to (13). In contrast to flock, however, a lot of X requires a plural verb when X is a plural noun: we cannot say *A lot of sheep is on my lawn.
(15) a. A lot of those sheep are scrawny. b. A flock of (those) sheep {is / are} on my lawn. c. A lot of (those) sheep {*is / are} on my lawn. d. An admirer of sheep {is / *are} on my lawn.
Evidently, the overall expression a lot of X can only designate the quantified mass, not the bounded unit of measurement profiled by lot individually.6 That is, the construction is necessarily exocentric, as shown for flock in Figures 3.7 and 3.8. We can relate this to the fact that lot has largely lost its group noun sense, so – in contrast to flock – the mass is the only tangible entity available to function as the nominal referent (see Figure 3.4(d)). In expressions of the form a N of X, therefore, the metonymic shift observed in Figures 3.7 and 3.8 is obligatory in the case of lot, optional for nouns like flock, and impossible for a noun like admirer, which is not based on coextension.
Expressions like a lot of sheep can thus have a structure analogous to either Figure 3.7 or Figure 3.8, depending on whether of profiles a restricted subpart relationship or one of coextension. With zero grounding of sheep, the former is the less likely alternative, though presumably still available. The mass with respect to which lot functions as a unit of measurement is then identified with a mass of sheep viewed as a restricted subpart of a larger mass (most likely the maximal extension, i.e. the set of all sheep). The restricted mass it quantifies is profiled by the expression as a whole, at the composite structure level, even though it is not profiled by either component structure.
Figure 3.9 represents the more likely analysis (analogous to Figure 3.8), where of profiles a relationship of coextension. In combination with a lot, this coextension is identified with the inherent relation between a unit of measurement and the mass it quantifies. Once again, the quantified mass is profiled at the composite structure level. Here, though, the profiled mass is not specifically portrayed as being drawn from a larger one. There is a tighter conceptual in-

Integration   73 tegration, in that the intrinsic relationship evoked by of collapses with the one inherent in the meaning of lot.
Figure 3.9
The structure in Figure 3.9 corresponds to (2)a, where a lot and the of-phrase are the major constituents, and the prepositional object is a nominal (not just an ungrounded noun). Earlier I provided a variety of evidence that this analysis is still available, if not the primary one. It represents a construal made possible by zero grounding of the prepositional object, since overt grounding – as in (15) a – induces the conception of a mass other than the one quantifed by lot. The structure in Figure 3.9, which does not invoke a larger mass, is presumably in the process of grammaticizing into a simple quantifying construction along the lines of (2)b. It is not unlikely that an essentially monomorphemic variant of alotta has already emerged for certain speakers. If so, it probably coexists with the analysis in Figure 3.9, where the constitutive elements are still recognizable to some extent. It is of course a basic tenet of CG that the analyzability of complex fixed expressions is a matter of degree (Langacker 2000). A lot of has a long way to go before it reaches the point of zero analyzability and reanalysis as a strictly monomorphemic expression.

74   A constructional approach to grammaticization
4. The indefinite article
Supposing that this development eventually runs its course, let us consider what must happen along the way. The structures in Figure 3.9 and (2)b differ in three basic respects. First, the article a and the preposition of lose their status as separate morphemes, either disappearing phonetically or being incorporated in the monomorphemic alotta. Concomitantly, there is a realignment of constituency, so that a, lot, and of – so long as there is still any vestige of analyzability – form a group that combines as a whole with the following nominal element. Finally, this element is reanalyzed as a noun rather than a full, independently grounded nominal. I am not prepared to specify the temporal sequencing of these developments, or the extent to which one presupposes or induces another. I will discuss them in the order listed, with no claim that it is necessarily chronological. More important than chronology, I suspect, is the independent existence of nominals of the form QNT+N, as in Figure 3.2. This construction offers a model for an alternative analysis, whether it facilitates the changes or merely provides a way to assimilate the resulting structure in the grammatical system.
In expressions like a woman from Brazil, the indefinite article functions as grounding element for the nominal as a whole. It singles out an instance of the type specified by the head noun, woman, and indicates that it was not previously accessible in the discourse as the unique instance of this type. Clearly, though, the function of a in a lot of X must be rather different. It combines directly with lot, but due to the metonymic shift, lot is not the head noun: the entity it profiles is not profiled by the nominal as a whole. Indeed, with the structure in Figure 3.9 there is no head noun so defined (this is what makes the construction exocentric). The indefinite article does still function here as a grounding element, but only locally, for the nominal a lot, rather than globally, for a lot of sheep overall.
Even in local terms, a does not have quite the same semantic value as in other uses. The reason is that lot, as a measure noun, does not specify a type with multiple instances which have to be distinguished or identified. The entity it designates is abstract – a vaguely delimited degree of extension along a scale – and as such is unique: there is only one lot, not a bunch of different lots that have to be distinguished from one another. In this respect lot is comparable to a number, like seven, which is also unique and abstract. In terms of uniqueness, lot is further comparable to a proper name, e.g. George Lakoff, which also specifies a type with just one instance (Langacker 2004c). When the indefinite article combines with lot, therefore, its referential function is much attenuated. While lot has an abstract referent (just as a number does), its uniqueness renders vacuous the function of singling out a particular instance of its type.

The indefinite article   75
Why, then, is lot not grounded by zero (as in the case of seven or George Lakoff), or by the definite article (the usual marker of contextual uniqueness)? Obviously, the choice of article is due to historical conservatism: we say a lot (rather than the lot or just lot) because it constitutes a fixed expression whose form was established at a stage when the meaning of lot was such that the indefinite article had its normal value. The fact that this is no longer the case creates the potential for the indefinite article to lose its status as a separate symbolic element. On the one hand, it might be reanalyzed as part of a monomorphemic quantifier: alotta. Alternatively, it might disappear altogether. Being phonologically minimal and having no essential semantic function, it would seem quite susceptible to phonetic erosion.
But this has not yet happened. Not only is the indefinite article still a separate element (cf. a whole lot of X), but it still has a discernible meaning consistent with a vestigial grounding function. We can see its meaningfulness by observing that a lot of X has a particular place in paradigms of quantifying expressions. As I noted at the outset, a lot of (as well as lots of) is competing with many and much. By now it is well established as a central member of the English quantifier system. Among the core members listed in (16)a–b, the older ones combine directly with a noun, whereas the newcomers – lot, lots, and bunch – require the preposition of. More to the point, the indefinite article that accompanies lot and bunch also appears in the core members a few and a little. Also related are the less grammaticized expressions in (16)c–d, where a still alternates with one and other numerals (a dozen X, one dozen X, two dozen X).7
(16) a. many X, much X, few X, little X, a few X, a little X, several X, three X b. a lot of X, lots of X, a bunch of X c. a dozen X, a hundred X, a thousand X d. a cup of X, a barrel of X, a yard of X, a ton of X, a case of X
So even within the core inventory, the indefinite article figures in several English quantifiers: a lot of, a bunch of, a few, a little. Moreover, the paradigmatic relationship among few, little, a few, and a little clearly demonstrates the article’s segmentability and meaningfulness in these expressions. All four quantifiers specify a value lower than the norm. They differ along two axes. Few and a few are used with plural masses (few cookies, a few cookies), little and a little with non-plural masses (little milk, a little milk). Along the second axis, few and little are negative expressions, governing negative polarity items
7 I consider only absolute quantifiers, not the relative quantifiers (all, most, some, no, every, each, any), since a lot of most closely resembles the former. (See Langacker 1991: § 2.3.3.)

Observe that a lot of and a bunch of behave analogously to a few and a little in this respect. I have proposed (Langacker To appear b) that these quantifiers have the conceptual import sketched in Figure 3.10, where dashed arrows represent a path of mental scanning. Many and much (also lots) specify a quantity that departs from the norm in a positive direction, while few and little are based on scanning in a negative direction. In terms of quantity, a few and a little are comparable to few and little – the quantity specified lies toward the lower end of the scale. They are however positive expressions by virtue of how the specified quantity is mentally accessed: instead of scanning downward from the norm, they are based on upward scanning from the scalar origin. I propose that a lot and a bunch are comparable, except that the upward scanning goes beyond the norm. On this account, the expressions in (c) and (d) share a component of meaning: they all specify a quantity through upward scanning from the scalar origin, i.e. as a positive increment starting from the baseline of zero. This notion of a positive increment is what I take to be the semantic contribution of the indefinite article in these expressions. Though abstract, it is quite consistent with the article’s basic value, where it occurs with count nouns (which profile bounded entities) and designates a single instance of the specified type.
Figure 3.10
The a that appears in a lot is therefore meaningful, and a lot is subtly distinct in meaning from many and much, despite their being equivalent in the quanti-

ties they indicate. Essentially the difference is one of analyzability, with a and lot construing the quantity in terms of incrementation by a single measurement unit. But with fixed expressions, analyzability – the extent to which component conceptions are activated along with the composite conception – is a matter of degree that tends to decline with continued frequent use. When it falls to zero, the resulting, unanalyzable expression will not necessarily retain the semantic nuances contributed by the component elements. Most likely, then, a monomorphemic alotta will wind up with the meaning of many and much, as sketched in diagram (a).8
5. Restructuring
In sum, semantic developments affecting lot and the construction as a whole result in the indefinite article’s attenuation and susceptibility to loss, whether through incorporation in a monomorphemic quantifier or total disappearance. The preposition of is likewise susceptible to loss in either fashion, also due to semantic developments in the construction as a whole. When it profiles a restricted subpart relationship, of makes a substantial semantic contribution by introducing an element not evoked by lot: a larger entity (its landmark) from which the quantified mass is drawn. But in Figure 3.9, where of profiles a relationship of coextension, it fails to contribute anything not already implicit in lot itself. As a measurement noun, lot itself includes the notion of coextension inherent in the relation between a measurement unit and the mass it quantifies. Semantically, therefore, of is fully subsumed in the meaning of lot: its trajector is identified with the measurement unit, its landmark with the quantified mass, and the profiled relationship of coextension with the intrinsic coextension of a measurement unit and what it measures. Because the entity specified by the prepositional object figures schematically in the meaning of lot, the preposition is not essential – the quantified mass could perfectly well be specified by a noun (like sheep) that directly combines with lot and elaborates its schematic reference to this mass. There is thus the potential for a monomorphemic quantifier to emerge (alotta) and combine with the quantified noun, just as in Figure 3.2.
Even while a and of are still segmentable and meaningful, expressions of the form a lot of X are capable of being assimilated to the global construction in Figure 3.2(b). That is, we can envisage a stage intermediate between (2)a and (2)b. At this stage the sequence a lot of is still internally analyzable, as in (2)a
8 It will however be slightly more schematic by virtue of neutralizing the distinction between a plural and a non-plural mass.

78   A constructional approach to grammaticization or Figure 3.9, but forms a constituent which, as a composite whole, functions as the quantifier in Figure 3.2(b). This analysis is shown in Figure 3.11. Possibly it coexists and competes with (2)a/Figure 3.9 at the present time. While I cannot be sure that a structure precisely like Figure 3.11 exists at any stage, it at least provides a tangible basis for discussing the transition from (2)a to (2)b, where alotta functions as a monomorphemic quantifier.
Figure 3.11
The differences between Figures 3.9 and 3.11 can all be ascribed to the expression being interpreted as instantiating the constructional schema in Figure 3.2(b). Most evident is the change in constituency, which brings the expression into line with the bipartite structure QNT+N. From the standpoint of CG, where constituency is seen as non-essential and often variable (Langacker 1997a), this is not a momentous adjustment. Less visible but grammatically more significant is the reinterpretation of sheep as a noun, rather than a full nominal (or “noun phrase”). This is possible due to the zero grounding option for English indefinites: there is no distinction in form between sheep as a plural noun, which merely specifies a type of mass, and sheep as a nominal designating an instance of that type (indefinite and unrestricted in terms of size). Being a simple noun, sheep then functions as lexical head in the overall expression, being

Restructuring   79
grounded by the quantifier in accordance with the pattern in Figure 3.2(b). The complex form a lot of fills the quantifier role.
A lot of serves this function by virtue of its composite structure assuming the value of QNT in Figure 3.2(b). The value shown represents the conflation of an absolute quantifier’s basic meaning with the import of zero grounding, resulting in a derived grounding quantifier.9 As a grounding element, QNT profiles the grounded entity, namely the quantified mass. And in accordance with its zero grounding component, the grounding relationship (the discourse status of the mass) is that of indefiniteness. But while zero grounding does not itself impose any restriction in regard to size, the grounding quantifier inherits the size specification of the quantifier. A lot of thus profiles a mass whose magnitude is specified by lot.
From a structure like Figure 3.11, the transition to (2)b is straightforward: it is basically just a matter of the composite expression a lot of losing its analyzability, whereby – ipso facto – it constitutes a monomorphemic quantifier. I have already noted that a and of, though meaningful, are semantically dispensable in the context of the overall construction. The preposition is wholly subsumed in the meaning of lot, so nothing is lost if it disappears or is no longer recognized as a separate element. As for a, which grounds lot (not the nominal as a whole), it has no real referential function, but merely indicates that the specified quantity is construed as a positive increment from the baseline of zero. This is not the only way to conceptualize a larger-than-normal mass: an alternative construal, exemplified by many and much, is based instead on upward scanning from the norm (Figure 3.10).10 Should a and lot lose their separate identities, therefore, the former construal will fade away and the latter will naturally emerge.
Given the basic tendency for fixed expressions to gradually lose their analyzability, we can expect a lot of to eventually coalesce into a simple, monomorphemic quantifier, as shown in Figure 3.12. It will then be equivalent to many and much (Figure 3.2(a)), except for neutralizing the distinction between a plural and a non-plural mass. It may well be that a lot of X already has the structure in Figure 3.12, for some speakers or even for all speakers some of the
9 By contrast, with relative quantifiers (all, most, every, etc.) the grounding function is intrinsic (Langacker 1991: § 2.3.2). The reanalysis of absolute quantifiers as grounding elements is outside the scope of this discussion.
10 Both meanings invoke the same essential content, including the notion of a scale, a baseline of zero, and a norm. The difference in construal is a matter of relative prominence: whether the baseline or the norm is foregrounded within the overall conception.

80   A constructional approach to grammaticization time. I have argued, however, that the structure in Figure 3.9 is still accessible, if not primary. The coexistence of multiple stages in the grammaticization process is, of course, to be expected (Heine 1992).
Figure 3.12
The picture I have sketched is complex but hopefully realistic. If we take seriously the view that grammaticization affects constructions, rather than isolated elements, a full description has to deal with these constructions in all their semantic and grammatical specificity. I have tried to illustrate, for one specific case, what such an account might look like. In particular, I have tried to indicate how the various factors involved – the meanings of component elements, their conceptual integration, and relations to other constructions – interact with one another. Describing these factors and their interaction, in a reasonable amount of explicit detail, is a key to both synchronic and diachronic analysis.

Chapter 4 Possession, location, and existence
Possessive constructions raise numerous issues of semantic and grammatical description. Among the questions to be addressed here are the following: (i) What is the semantic value of possessive elements and possessive constructions? (ii) How does nominal possession serve a grounding function? (iii) What is the relationship between nominal and clausal possession? (iv) What is the relationship between the different kinds of clausal possessive constructions? (v) How do clausal possessive predicates grammaticize from their lexical sources? (vi) What is the relationship among possession, location, and existence?
1. What is “possession”?
Semantically, the traditional label possessive is anything but self-explanatory. The term itself does not adequately define or delimit the phenomenon, since possessive constructions apply to a much wider range of circumstances than does either the verb possess or the noun possession in their non-technical uses. A notion like ‘ownership’, even interpreted rather loosely, comes nowhere near exhausting the range of cases covered by a nominal possessive (X’s Y) or a clausal possessive (X has a Y). This has led some analysts to propose that linguistic possession implies nothing more than the existence of some association or relationship between possessor and possessed. For instance: “… A has B expresses that there is some state relation between ‘A’ and ‘B’ and … leaves a more precise specification of this relation to the context” (Bendix 1966: 120).
As seen in (1)a, the variety of examples does suggest a description having this level of generality. However, the mere notion that there exists an association or relationship between possessor and possessed is not quite sufficient, as it fails to account for the asymmetry in possessive expressions. While there are exceptions (e.g. the doctor’s patient vs. the patient’s doctor), in general the possessor and possessed cannot be reversed, as observed in (1)b.

My own proposal for a semantic characterization starts from a general claim of CG: that certain fundamental and universal grammatical notions – among them noun, verb, subject, object, and possessive – can be characterized semantically at both the prototype level and the schema level. The prototype is based on an experientially grounded conceptual archetype. The schematic characterization (claimed to be valid for all instances) invokes a basic cognitive ability which is immanent in the archetype (i.e. “lies within it”). First manifested in the archetype, this cognitive ability is later extended to other cases.
It seems fairly evident that ownership, kinship, and whole/part relationships are prototypical for possessive constructions, with ownership arguably being more central than the others (Taylor 1996). These are the kinds of notions that I identify as conceptual archetypes – fundamental aspects of everyday experience which are cognitively basic and apprehended as gestalts despite their analytical complexity. The term possession reflects the archetype of ownership. What about a schematic description? For this level I have proposed a characterization in terms of what I call the reference point ability (Chapter 2: § 3).
Diagrammed in Figure 4.1, the reference point ability is our capacity to invoke one conceived entity as a means of establishing mental contact with another, i.e. mentally accessing one entity via another. The conceptualizer (C) first directs attention to the entity serving as reference point (R). Attending to R evokes a set of associated entities, collectively called its dominion (D), one of which is the target (T). A reference point relationship is thus a matter of sequenced mental access, where directing attention to R makes it possible to then direct attention to T.
Figure 4.1
Since the reference point ability is independent of any particular conceptual content, it is sufficiently abstract and flexible to accommodate the full range of possessive expressions. At the same time, it is inherently asymmetrical, thus accounting for the typical irreversibility of possessive relationships. It therefore seems reasonable as a schematic characterization of possessives.

What is “possession”?   83
Reference point accounts have also been given of topic constructions, the subject and object relations, and pronominal anaphora (van Hoek 1995, 1997). Evidence for the reference point analysis is therefore provided by the many grammatical phenomena observable cross-linguistically in which the notions possessor, subject, topic, and pronominal antecedent display a special affinity to one another (Langacker 2001a; Kumashiro and Langacker 2003). To take just one example, I characterize trajector and landmark – expressed as grammatical subject and object – as reference points evoked by way of mentally accessing a profiled relationship. This directly accounts for the cross-linguistically prevalent use of possessive locutions to express the trajector and landmark of a nominalized verb (e.g. Booth’s assassination, Lincoln’s assassination). A nominalized verb profiles an abstract thing (produced by conceptual reification), so the relation which the trajector or landmark bears to it is then a reference point relationship between two things, which is just what possession is claimed to be.
Further supporting the reference point account is the fact that the possessive archetypes – ownership, kinship, and whole/part relations – are all clear examples of reference point organization. This is perfectly evident in the case of kinship expressions, for a person is not an uncle, a sister, or a grandfather intrinsically, but only in relation to a particular reference individual. In a phrase like Sherridan’s grandfather, it is only with reference to Sherridan that the person designated qualifies as a grandfather. Likewise, a part is apprehended and characterized as such only in relation to the whole. A mane, for example, only qualifies as such by virtue of its place on a lion or a horse. Viewed in isolation from the lion, a lion’s mane is just a mass of hair.
What about ownership? Typically a given person owns a considerable number of possessions, each of which he controls and can access when desired. Thus, mentally accessing a particular person affords a way of mentally accessing a substantial array of associated objects – those which this person controls. The opposite is not true; typically a given object is connected to just one person in this fashion. In terms of cognitive efficiency, therefore, it is easier to identify possessions in relation to their owner than conversely. People also have far greater cognitive salience to us than do typical possessions. We know and recognize far more people as individuals than we do wallets, beds, or bank accounts. We think of the world as being populated by people, each of whom has an assortment of possessions, rather than thinking of the world as being populated by wallets, beds, bank accounts, etc., each of which has a person attached. These factors point to a clear asymmetry in which owners are natural reference points, their possessions being targets.
It is important to understand how the possessive schema is immanent in the possessive archetypes. In prototypical instances of possession, the possessor (R)

84   Possession, location, and existence
actively controls the possessed (T) in some manner – physically, socially, or experientially. The flip side of R controlling T is that R has an exclusive privilege of access to T. In the case of ownership (e.g. my pen), R manipulates T, determines where T is kept, and can use T whenever desired. This control also has social and experiential components. Others acknowledge these privileges. Moreover, R knows where T is and determines whether others can use it. Similarly, a kinship relation entails an array of culturally expected modes of social interaction. One interacts with a parent, a child, or a grandchild in a way that others are not allowed or expected to. This privileged social access is basically exclusive: there are few if any other people for whom my sister is a sister. Likewise, a part usually belongs to just one highest-level whole. I am the only one who can use my stomach for digestion. I also have the exclusive privilege of experiencing it (e.g. when it hurts) and controlling its location (when I move, it goes along with me).
This active control by R is part of the situation evoked and alluded to by possessive expressions. In my terminology, it is onstage and objectively construed, i.e. it functions as an object of conception. It is represented in Figure 4.2 by a solid arrow. With respect to this onstage relationship, the dominion (D) can be interpreted as the set of targets over which R exercises control, the region within R’s purview. Also seen in Figure 4.2 are dashed arrows representing the path of mental access on the part of C, the conceptualizer (primarily the speaker). C’s activity is not part of the situation described. Rather, it is offstage and subjectively construed, i.e. it inheres in the subject of conception – an aspect of the conceptualizing process that is not itself conceived. This subjectively construed relationship, whereby C invokes R as a reference point to mentally access T, is posited for all possessives, constituting their schematic characterization. By contrast, the objectively construed relationship of R controlling T is prototypical but does not extend to all instances.
Figure 4.2

Possessive grounding   85
The two paths of access – objective control by R, mental access by C – are closely related. R’s objective relationship to T provides the basis for the subjective relationship of C using R to mentally access T. It is precisely by virtue of C apprehending R’s control of T that C traces a mental path from R to T. More­ over, C’s subjective mental path is immanent in (lies within) C’s conception of the objective relationship: sequenced mental access – first conceptualizing R, then T – is an inherent aspect of conceptualizing R controlling T.
While prototypical, an objectively construed relationship of the possessor controlling the possessed becomes more tenuous with more peripheral exemplars and is often absent altogether. In cases like (2), it is hard to discern any real sense in which R objectively controls or has privileged access to T. Here the possessor’s role in the onstage situation is essentially a passive one. R does however function as a reference point, providing a mental point of access invoked by the conceptualizer to identify a particular target.1 This is the schematic import of possessives, inherent in all instances.

The relation between the possessive prototype and the possessive schema qualifies as an instance of subjectification, in my sense of the term (Langacker 1990b, 1998b, 1999e) as opposed to Traugott’s (e.g. 1989). As I define it, subjectification occurs when an objectively construed relationship fades away, leaving behind a subjectively construed relationship that was immanent in it (inherent in its conception). We can see this process as either a developmental change, assuming that a child masters prototypical possessives earlier than examples like (2), or else a diachronic one pertaining to the grammaticization of possessive elements and constructions. Of course, the prototype does not disappear as the more schematic value emerges. Both are necessary in a full description of possessive phenomena.

Nominal possessives, as in Sally’s friend or my new car, generally function as determiners. In CG terminology, they are grounding elements, analogous to
