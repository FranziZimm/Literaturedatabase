This book is very much a product of the incredibly stimulating and open intellectual environment of the University of California at Berkeley , where I have been privileged to work for the past thirteen years . I could not have done this work anywhere else. Much of what I have learned dur­ ing this period has come through interactions with remarkable col­ leagues , especially Brent Berlin, Hubert Dreyfus, Charles Fillmore , Jim Greeno , Paul Kay, Eleanor Rosch , Dan Siobin, Eve Sweetser, Len Talmy, Robert Wilensky, and Lotfi Zadeh. I have also been blessed with remarkable student s, especially Cl audia Brugman, Pamela Downing, Michele Emanatian, Rob MacLaury, Chad McDaniel , and Jeanne van Oosten , and much of this book reflects what I have learned from them . Case study 2 is an extension and elaboration of part of Brugman's 1981 master's thesis . Case study 1 was done jointly with Zoltan K6vecses , whose stay at Berkeley during the 1982-83 academic year was funded by the American Council of Learned Societies. Without their insight, their diligence , and their gener\>sity, t�is book would be much the poorer.
I have also been fortunate to be part of a widespread network of cogni­ tive scientists whose research complements my own and who have been unsparingly generous in keeping me informed of their research and in commenting on mine:

Preface
Cognitive science is a new field that brings together what is known cbout the mind from many academic disciplines: psychology, linguistics, anthro­ pology, philosophy, and computer science. It seeks detailed answers to such questions as: What is reason? How do we make sense of our experi­ ence? What is a conceptual system and how is it organized? Do all people use the same conceptual system? If so, what is that system? If not, exactly what is there that is common to the way all human beings think? The questions aren't new , but some recent answers are .
This book is abou� the traditional answers to these questions and about recent research that suggests new answers . On the traditional view, rea­ son is abstract and disembodied. On the new view, reason has a bodily ba­ sis . The traditional view sees reason as literal , as primarily about proposi­ tions that can be objectively either true or false . The new view takes imaginative aspects of reason-metaphor, metonymy , and mental imag­ ery-as central to reason , rather than as a peripheral and inconsequential adjunct to the literal .
The traditional account claims that the capacity for meaningful thought and for reason is abstract and not necessarily embodied in any organism. Thus , meaningful concepts and rationality are transcendental, in the sense that they transcend , or go beyond , the physical limitations of any orga­ nis m . Meaningful concepts and abstract reason may happen to be embod­ ied in human beings , or in machines , or in other organisms-but they exist abstractly , independent of any particular embodiment. In the new view, meaning is a matter of what is meaningful to thinking, functioning beings . The nature of the thinking organism and the way it functions in its environment are of central concern to the study of reason .
B oth views take categorization as the main way that we make sense of experience . Categories on the traditional view are characterized solely by the properties shared by their members. That is, they are characterized
xi

xii Preface
(a) independently of the bodily nature of the beings doing the categoriz­ ing and (b) literally, with no imaginative mechanisms (metaphor, meton­ ymy, and imagery) entering into the nature of categories. In the new view, our bodily experience and the way we use imaginative mechanisms are central to how we construct categories to make sense of experience .
Cognitive science is now in transition. The traditional view is hanging on , although the new view is beginning to take hold . Categorization is a central issue. The traditional view is tied to the classical theory that categories are defined in terms of common properties of their members . B ut a wealth of new data on categorization appears to contradict the traditional view of categories. In its place there is a new view of catego­ ries, what Eleanor Rosch has termed the theory ofprototypes and basic­ level categories. We will be surveying that data and its implications .
The traditional view is a philosophical one . It has come out of two thousand years of philosophizing about the nature of reason. It is still widely believed despite overwhelming empirical evidence against it . There are two reasons . The first is simply that it is traditional . The accumu­ lated weight of two thousand years of philosophy does not go away over­ night . We have all been educated to think in those terms . The second reason is that there has been, until recently, nothing approaching a well­ worked-out alternative that preserves what was correct in the traditional view while modifying it to account for newly discovered data. This book will also be concerned with describing such an alternative.
We will be call ing the traditional view objectivism for the following reason: Modern attempts to make it work assume that rational thought consists of the manipulation of abstract symbols and that these symbols get their meaning via a correspondence with the world, objectively con­ strued, that is , independent of the understanding of any organism . A col­ lection of symbols placed in correspondence with an objectively struc­ tured world is viewed as a representation of reality. On the obj ectivist view, all rational thought involves the manipulation of abstract symbols which are given meaning only via conventional correspondences with things in the external world.
Among the more specific objectivist views are the following:
- Thought is the mechanical manipulation of abstract symbols. - The mind is an abstract machine, manipulating symbols essentially in
the way a computer does, that is, by algorithmic computation. _ Symbols (e.g. , words and mental representations) get their meaning
via correspondences to things in the external world . All meaning is of this character.

Preface xiii
- Symbols that correspond to the external world are internal representa­ tions of external reality.
- Abstract symbols may stand in correspondence to things in the world independent of the peculiar properties of any organisms.
- Since the human mind makes use of internal representations of exter­ nal reality , the mind is a mirror of nature, and correct reason mirrors the logic of the external world.
- It is thus incidental to the nature of meaningful concepts and reason that human beings have the bodies they have and function in their en­ vironment in the way they do. Human bodies may play a role in choosing which concepts and which modes of transcendental reason human beings actually employ, but they play no essential role in char­ acterizing what constitutes a concept and what constitutes reason .
- Thought i s abstract and disembodied, since i t i s independent o f any limitations of the human body, the human perceptual system , and the human nervous system .
- Machines that do no more than mechanically manipulate symbols that correspond to things in the world are capable of meaningful thought and reason.
- Thought is atomistic, in that it can be completely broken down into simple "building blocks"-the symbols used in thought-which are combined into complexes and manipulated by rule.
- Thought is logical in the narrow technical sense used by philosophical logicians; that is, it can be modeled accurately by systems of the sort used in mathematical logic. These are abstract symbol systems defined by general principles of symbol manipulation and mecha­ nisms for interpreting such symbols in terms of "models of the world."
Though such views are by no means shared by all cognitive scientists , they are nevertheless widespread , and in fact so common that many of them are often assumed to be true without question or comment. Many , per­ haps even most, contemporary discussions of the mind as a computing machine take such views for granted.
The idea of a category is central to such views . The reason is that most symbols (i.e . , words and mental representations) do not designate particular things or individuals in the world (e.g. , Rickey Henderson or the Golden Gate Bridge). Most of our words and concepts designate catego­ ries. Some of these are categories of things or beings in the physical world�hairs and zebras, for example. Others are categories of activities and abstract things-singing and songs , voting and governments , etc. To a very large extent, the objectivist view of language and thought rests on

xiv Preface
the nature of categories . On the objectivist view , things are in the same category if and only if they have certain properties in common . Those properties are necessary and sufficient conditions for defi ning the cate­
gory. On the objectivist view of meaning, the symbols used in thought get
their meaning via their correspondence with things-particular things or categories of things-in the world. Since categories, rather than individ­ uals, matter most in thought and reason , a category must be the sort of thing that can fit the objectivist view of mind in general . All conceptual categories must be symbols (or symbolic structures) that can designate categories in the real world, or in some possible world. And the world must come divided up into categories of the right kind so that symbols and symbolic structures can refer to them . "Categories of the right kind" are classical categories , categories defined by the properties common to all their members.
In recent years , conceptual categories have been studied intensively and in great detail in a number of the cognitive sciences�specially an­ thropology , linguistics , and psychology . The evidence that has accumulated is in conflict with the objectivist view of mind. Conceptual categories are , on the whole, very different from what the obj ectivist view requires of them . That evidence suggests a very different view, not only of categories, but of human reason in general :

_ Thought is embodied, that is, the structures used to put together our

conceptual systems grow out of bodily ex�erience and make sense in

terms of it; moreover, the core of our conceptual systems is directly

grounded in perception , body movement, and experience of a physi­

cal and social character.

_ Thought is imaginative , in that those concepts which are not directly grounded in experience employ metaphor, metonymy , and mental

imagery-all of which go beyond the literal mirroring , or representa­

tion, of external reality . It is this imaginative capacity that allows for

"abstract" thought and takes the mind beyond what we can see and

feel . The imaginative capacity is also embodied-indirectly-since

the metaphors, metonymies, and images are based on experience , of­

ten bodily experience. Thought is also imaginative in a less obvious

way: ror n

_ Thought has gestaltproperties and is thus not atomistic ; concepts have

_ Thought has an ecological structure. The efficiency of cognitive pro-

Preface xv
cessing, as in learning and memory, depends on the overall structure of the conceptual system and on what the concepts mean. Thought is thus more than just the mechanical manipulation of abstract symbols. - Conceptual structure can be described using cognitive models that have the above properties. - The theory of cognitive models incorporates what was right about the traditional view of categorization, meaning, and reason, while ac­ counting for the empirical data on categorization and fitting the new view overall.
I will refer to the new view as experiential realism or alternatively as ex­ perientialism. The term experiential realism emphasizes what experien­ tialism shares with objectivism: (a) a commitment to the existence of the real world, (b) a recognition that reality places constraints on concepts, (c) a conception of truth that goes beyond mere internal coherence , and (d) a commitment to the existence of stable knowledge of the world.
B oth names reflect the idea that thought fundamentally grows out of embodiment. "Experience" here is taken in a broad rather than a narrow sense. It includes everything that goes to make up actual or potential experiences of either individual organisms or communities of organisms -not merely perception , motor movement , etc . , but especially the internal genetically acquired makeup of the organism and the nature of its interactions in both its physical and its social environments.
Experientialism is thus defined in contrast with objectivism , which holds that the characteristics of the organism have nothing essential to do with concepts or with the nature of reason. On the objectivist view, hu­ man reason is just a limited form of transcendental reason. The only roles accorded to the body are (a) to provide access to abstract concepts, (b) to provide "wetware ," that is, a biological means of mimicking patterns of transcendental reason, and (c) to place limitations on possible concepts and forms of reason . On the experientialist view, reason is made possible by the body-that includes abstract and creative reason , as well as reasoning about concrete things . Human reason is not an instantiation of transcendental reason; it grows out of the nature of the organism and all that contributes to its individual and collective experience : its genetic in­ heritance , the nature of the environment it lives in, the way it functions in that environment , the nature of its social functioning, and the like .
The issue is this :
Do meaningful thought and reason concern merely the manipulation of abstract symbols and their correspondence to an objective reality, independent of any embodiment (except , perhaps, for limitations im­ posed by the organism)?

XVI Preface
Or do meaningful thought and reason essentially concern the nature of the organism doing the thinking--including the nature of its body , its interactions in its environment , its social character , and so on?
Though these are highly abstract questions , there does exist a body of evi­ dence that suggests that the answer to the first question is no and the an­ swer to the second is yes. That is a significant part of what this book is
about. Why does all this matter? It matters for our understanding of who we
are as human beings and for all that follows from that understanding . The capacity to reason is usually taken as defining what human beings are and as distinguishing us from other things that are alive . If we understand rea­ son as being disembodied , then our bodies are only incidental to what we are . If we understand reason as mechanical-the sort of thing a computer can do---then we will devalue human intelligence as computers get more efficient. If we understand rationality as the capacity to mirror the world external to human beings , then we will devalue those aspects of the mind that can do infinitely more than that . If we understand reason as merely literal , we will devalue art .
How we understand the mind matters in all these ways and more . It matters for what we value in ourselves and others-for education, for re­ search , for the way we set up human institutions, and most important for what counts as a humane way to live and act. If we understand reason as embodied , then we will want to understand the relationship between the mind and the body and to find out how to cultivate the embodied aspects of reason . I f we fully appreciate the role of the imaginative aspects of rea­ son , we will give them full value, investigate them more thoroughly, and provide better education in using them. Our ideas about what people can learn and should be learning, as well as what they should be doing with what they learn , depend on our concept of learning itself. It is important that we have discovered that learning for the most part is neither rote learning nor the learning of mechanical procedures . It is important that we have discovered that rational thought goes well beyond the literal and the mechanical . It is important because our ideas about how human minds should be employed depend on our ideas of what a human mind is .
It also matters in a narrower but no less important way. Our under­ standing of what reason is guides our current research on the nature of reason. At present , that research is expanding faster than at any time in histor y. The research choices made now by the community of cognitive scientists w ill shape our view of m ind for a long time to come. We are at present at an important turning point in the history of the study of the mind . It is vital thai the mistaken views about the mind that have been with us for two thousand years be corrected.

Preface XVJJ
This book attempts to bring together some of the evidence for the view that reason is embodied and imaginative-in particular, the evidence that comes from the study of the way people categorize . Conceptual systems are organized in terms of categories , and most if not all of our thought in­ volves those categories. The objectivist view rests on a theory of catego­ ries that goes back to the ancient Greeks and that even today is taken for granted as being not merely true, but obviously and unquestionably true . Yet contemporary studies of the way human beings actually categorize things suggest that categorization is a rather different and more complex matter.
What is most interesting to me about these studies is that they seem to provide evidence for the experientialist view of human reason and against the objectivist view. Taken one by one , such studies are things only scholars could care about, but taken as a whole , they have something magnificent about them : evidence that the mind is more than a mere mir­ ror of nature or a processor of symbols, that it is not incidental to the mind that we have bodies , and that the capacity for understanding and mean­ ingful thought goes beyond what any machine can do.

The Importance of Categorization
Many readers , I suspect, will take the title of this book as suggesting that women , fire , and dangerous things have something in common-say , that women are fiery and dangerous. Most feminists I've mentioned it to have loved the title for that reason , though some have hated it for the same rea­ son. But the chain of inference-from conjunction to categorization to commonality-is the norm . The inference is based on the common idea of what it means to be in the same category: things are categorized together on the basis of what they have in common. The idea that categories are defined by common prcperties is not only our ever yday folk theory of what a category is , it is also the principal technical theory-one that has been with us for morc than two thousand years .
The classical view that categories are based on shared properties is not entirely WroLg. We often do categorize things on that basis . But that is only a small part of the story. In recent years it has become clear that categorization is far more complex than that . A new theory of categoriza­ tion, called prototype theory, has emerged . It shows that human categori­ zation is based on principles that extend far beyond those envisioned in the classical theor y. One of our goals is to survey the complexities of the way people really categorize . For example , the title of this book was in­ spired by the Australian aboriginal language Dyirbal, which has a cate­ gor y, balan , that actually includes women , fire , and dangerous things . It also includes birds that are not dangerous , as well as exceptional animals , such as the platypus , bandicoot , and echidna . This is not simply a matter of categorization b.y common properties , as we shall see when we discuss Dyirbal classification in detail .
Categorization i s not a matter to be taken lightly. There i s nothing more basic than categorization to our thought, perception , action , and speech/, Ever y time we see something as a kind of thing , for example , a tree , we are categorizing . Whenever we reason about kinds of things�hairs , nations , illnesses, emotions , any kind of thing at all-\\:,e
5

6 Chapter 1
are employing categories . Whenever we intentionally perform any kind of action , say something as mundane as writing with a pencil, hammering with a h ammer, or ironing clothes, we are using categories. The particular action we perform on that occasion is a kind of motor activity (e .g . , writ­ ing , hammering, ironing), that is , it is in a particular category of motor ac­ tions. They are never done in exactly the same way, yet despite the differ­ ences in particular movements, they are all movements of a kind, and we know how to make movements of that kind. And any time we either pro­ duce or understand any utterance of any reasonable length, we are em­ ploying dozens if not hundreds of categories: categories of speech sounds , of words, of phrases and clauses , as well as conceptual categories . With­ out the ability to categorize, we could not function at all , either in the physical world or in our social and intellectual lives . An understanding of how we categorize is central to any understanding of how we think and how we function , and therefore central to an understanding of what makes us human.
Most categorization is automatic and unconscious , and if we become aware of it at all , it is only in problematic cases . In moving about the world , we automatically categorize people , animals , and physical objects, both natural and man-made . This sometimes leads to the impression that we just categorize things as they are , that things come in natural kinds , and that our categories of mind naturally fit the kinds of things there are in the world. But a large proportion of our categories are not categories of things; they are categories of abstract entities . We categorize events , ac­ tions , emotions, spatial relationships , social relationships, and abstract entities of an enormous range: governments, illnesses, and entities in both scientific and folk theories, like electrons and colds. Any adequate account of human thought must provide an accurate theory for all our categories, both concrete and abstract.
From the time of Aristotle to the later work of Wittgenstein , categories were thought be well understood and unproblematic. They were assumed to be abstract containers , with things either inside or outside the cate­ gory. Things were assumed to be in the same category if and only if they had certain properties in common . And the properties they had in com­ mon were taken as defining the categor y.
This classical theory was not the result of empirical study, It was not
even a subject of major debate. It was a philosophical position arrived at on the basis of a priori speculation. Over the centuries it simply became part of the background assumptions taken for g� anted in most schola� ly disciplines. In fact , until very recently, the classical theory of categones w as not even thought of as a theory. It was taught in most disciplines not as an empirical hypothesis but as an unquestionable , definitional truth .

The Importance of Categorization 7
In a remarkably short time, all that has changed. Categorization has moved from the background to center stage because of empirical studies in a wide range of disciplines. Within cognitive psychology, categoriza­ tion has b ecome a major field of study, thanks primarily to the pioneering work of Eleanor Rosch , who made categorization an issue. She focused on two implications of the classical theory:
First , if categories are defined only by properties that all members share, then no members should be better examples of the category than any other members.
Second , if categories are defined only by properties inherent in the members, then categories should be independent of the peculiarities of any beings doing the categorizing; that is, they should not involve such matters as human neurophysiology, human body movement, and spe­ cific human capacities to perceive , to form mental images, to learn and remem ber, to organize the things learned , and to communicate ef­ ficie ntly .
Rosch observed that studies by herself and others demonstrated that categories, in general, have best examples (called "prototypes") and that all of the specifically human capacities just mentioned do play a role in categorization.
In retrospect, such results should not have been all that surprising. Yet the specific details sent shock waves throughout the cognitive sciences , and many of the reverberations are still to be felt. Prototype theory, as it is evolving, is chailging our idea of the most fundamental of human capac­ ities-the capacity to categorize-and with it, our idea of what the human mind and human reason are like. Reason, in the West , has long been assumed to be disembodied and abstract--distinct on the one hand from perception and the body and culture , and on the other hand from the mechanisms of imagination, for example, metaphor and mental imagery.
In this century, reason has been understood by many philosophers, psychologists, and others as roughly fitting the model of formal deductive logic:
Reason is the mechanical manipulation of abstract symbols which are meaningless in themselves , but can be given meaning by virtue of their capacity to refer to things either in the actual world or in possible states of the world.
Since the digital computer works by symbol manipulation and since its symbols can be interpreted in terms of a data base, which is often viewed as a partial model of reality, the computer has been taken by many as es­ sentially possessing the capacity to reason . This is the basis of the contem-

8 Chapter 1
porar y mind-as-computer metaphor, which has spread from computer science and cognitive psychology to the culture at large .
Since we reason not just about individual things or people but about categories of things and people, categorization is crucial to every view of reason . Every view of reason must have an associated account of categorization . The view of reason as the disembodied manipulation of abstract symbols comes with an implicit theory of categorization. It is a version of the classical theory in which categories are represented by sets , which are in turn defined by the properties shared by their members .
There is a good reason why the view of reason as disembodied symbol-manipulation makes use of the classical theory of categories. If symbols in general can get their meaning only through their capacity to correspond to things, then category symbols can get their meaning only through a capacity to correspond to categories in the world (the real world or some possible world) . Since the symbol-to-object correspondence that defines meaning in general must be independent of the peculiarities of the human mind and body , it follows that the symbol-to-category correspon­ dence that defines meaning for category symbols must also be indepen­ dent of the peculiarities of the human mind and body. To accomplish this , categories must be seen as existing in the world independent of people and defined only by the characteristics of their members and not in terms of any characteristics of the human. The classical theor y is just what is needed, since it defines categories only in terms of shared properties of the members and not in terms of the peculiarities of human understand­ mg .
To question the classical view o f categories i n a fundamental way i s thus to question the view of reason as disembodied symbol-manipulation and correspondingly to question the most popular version of the mind-as­ computer metaphor. Contemporary prototype theory does just that­ through detailed empirical research in anthropology , linguistics, and psy­ chology.
The approach to prototype theory that we will be presenting here sug­ gests that human categorization is essentially a matter of both human experience and imagination-Df perception, motor activity , and culture on the one hand, and of metaphor, metonymy, and mental imagery on the other. As a consequence, human reason crucially depends on the same factors, and therefore cannot be characterized merely in terms of the manipulation of abstract symbols. Of course, certain aspects of hu­ man reason can be isolated artificially and modeled by abstract symbol­ manipulation, just as some part of human categorization does fit the classical theory . But we are interested not merely in some artificially iso­ latable subpart of the human capacity to categorize and reason, but in the

The Importance of Categorization 9
full range of that capacity . As we shall see , those aspects of categorization that do fit the classical theor y are special cases of a general theory of cognitive models, one that permits us to characterize the experiential and imaginative aspects of reason as well.
To change the very concept of a category is to change not only our con­ cept of the mind , but also our understanding of the world . Categories are categories of things . Since we understand the world not only in terms of individual things but also in terms of categories of things , we tend to attribute a real existence to those categories . We have categories for bio­ logical species, physical substances , artifacts, colors , kinsmen , and emo­ tions and even categories of sentences , words, and meanings . We have categories for ever ything we can think about . To change the concept of category itself is to change our understanding of the world. At stake is our understanding of everything from what a biological species is (see chap . 12) to what a word is (see case study 2) .
The evidence we will be considering suggests a shift from classical cate­ gories to prototype-based categories defined by cognitive models . It is a change that implies other changes: changes in the concepts of truth, knowledge , meaning, rationality�ven grammar. A number of familiar ideas will fall by the wayside . Here are some that will have to be left be­ hind:
- Meaning is based on truth and reference; it concerns the relationship between symbols and things in the world .
- Biological species are natural kinds, defined by common essential properties.
- The mind is separate from, and independent of, the body . - Emotion has no conceptual content . - Grammar is a matter of pure form . - Reason is transcendental , in that it transcends-goes beyond-the
way human beings, or any other kinds of beings, happen to think. It concerns the inferential relationships among all possible concepts in this universe or any other. Mathematics is a form of transcendental reason. - There is a correct, God's eye view of the world-a single correct way of understanding what is and is not true . - All people think using the same conceptual system.
These ideas have been part of the superstructure of Western intellectual life for two thousand years . They are tied, in one way or another, to the classical concept of a category. When that concept is left behind, the others will be too . They need to be replaced by ideas that are not only more accurate, but more humane.

10 Chapter 1
Many of the ideas we will be arguing against , on empirical grounds , have been taken as part of what defines science . One consequence of this study will be that certain common views of science will seem too narrow. Consider, for example , scientific rigor. There is a narrow view of science that considers as rigorous only hypotheses framed in first-order predicate calculus with a standard model-theoretic interpretation, or some equiva­ lent system , say a computer program using primitives that are taken as corresponding to an external reality. Let us call this the predicate calculus (or " PC") view of scientific theorizing. The PC view characterizes explanations only in terms of deductions from hypotheses , or correspond­ ingly, in terms of computations. Such a methodology not only claims to be rigorous in itself, it also claims that no other approach can be sufficiently precise to be called scientific . The PC view is prevalent in certain commu­ nities of linguists and cognitive psychologists and enters into many in­ vestigations in the cognitive sciences.
S uch a view of science has long been discredited among philosophers of science (for example, see Hanson 1961 , Hesse 1963 , Kuhn 1 970, 1 977, and Feyerabend 1 975) . As we will see (chaps. 1 1-20) , the PC view is espe­ cially inappropriate in the cognitive sciences since it assumes an a priori view of categorization, namely, the classical theory that categories are sets defined by common properties of objects . Such an assumption makes it impossible to ask, as an empirical question, whether the classical view of categorization is correct. The classical view is assumed to be correct, because it is built into classical logic, and hence into the PC view. Thus , we sometimes find circular arguments about the nature of categorization that are of the following form:
Premise (often hidden) : The PC view of scientific rigor is correct .
Conclusion: Categories are classical.
The conclusion is , of course, presupposed by the premise. To avoid vacu­ ity, the empirical study of categorization cannot take the PC view of scientific rigor for granted .
A central goal of cognitive science is to discover what reason is like and , correspondingly , what categories are like. It is therefore especially important for the study of cognitive science not to assume the PC view, which presupposes an a priori answer to such empirical questions. This , of course , does not mean that one cannot be rigorous or precise. It only means that rigor and precision must be characterized in another way-a

The Importance of Categorization 1 1
way that does not stifle the empirical study of the mind . We will suggest such a way in chapter 17.
The PC view of rigor leads to rigor mortis in the study of categoriza­ tion. It leads to a view of the sort proposed by Osherson and Smith (198 1 ) and Armstrong, Gleitman, and Gleitman (1983) and discussed in chapter 9 below, namely, that the classical view of categorization is correct and the enormous number of phenomena that do not accord with it are either due to an "identification" mechanism that has nothing to do with reason or are minor "recalcitrant" phenomena. As we go through this book, we will see that there seem to be more so-called recalcitrant phenomena than there are phenomena that work by the classical view.
This book surveys a wide variety of rigorous empirical studies of the ncture of human categorization. In concluding that categorization is not classical , the book implicitly suggests that the PC view of scientific rigor is itself not scientifically valid. The result is not chaos, but an expanded per­ spective on human reason , one which by no means requires imprecision or vagueness in scientific inquiry. The studies cited , for example, those by Berlin, Kay, Ekman, Rosch, Tversky, Dixon, and many others, more than meet the prevailing standards of scientific rigor and accuracy, while challenging the conception of categories presupposed by the PC view of rigor. In addition, the case studies presented below in Book II are intended as examples of empirical research that meet or exceed the pre­ vailing standards. In correcting the classical view of categorization, such studies serve to raise the general standards of scientific accuracy in the cognitive sciences .
The view of categorization that I will be presenting has not arisen all at once . It has developed through a number of intermediate stages that lead up to the cognitive model approach. An account of those intermediate steps begins with the later philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein and goes up through the psychological research of Eleanor Rosch and her associ­ ates.

2 CHAPTER
From Wittgenstein to Rosch
The short history I am about to give is not intended to be exhaustive . Its purpose , instead , is to give some sense of the development of the major themes I will be discussing. Here are some of those themes.
Family resemblances: The idea that members o f a category may b e re­ lated to one another without all members having any properties in common that define the categor y .
Centrality.' The idea that some members o f a categor y may b e " better examples" of that category than others.
Polysemy as categorization: The idea that related meanings of words form categories and that the meanings bear family resemblances to one another.
Generativity as a prototype phenomenon: This idea ccncerns categories that are defined by a generator (a particular member or subcategor y) pius rules (or a general principle such as similarity) . In such cases , the generator has the status of a central , or " prototypical," categor y member.
Membersh ip gradience: The idea that at least some categories have de­ grees of membership and no clear boundaries .
Centrality gradience: The idea that members (or subcategories) which are clearly within the category boundaries may still be more or less central .
Conceptual embodiment: The idea that the properties of certain catego­ ries are a consequence of the nature of human biological capacities and of the experience of functioning in a physical and social environ­ ment . It is contrasted with the idea that concepts exist independent of the bodily nature of any thinking beings and independent of their expe rience .
Functional embodiment: The idea that certain concepts are not merely understood intellectually; rather, they are used automatically, un­ consciously, and without noticeable effort as part of normal func-
12

From Wittgenstein to Rosch 13
tioning . Concepts used in this way have a different, and more impor­ tant , psychological status than those that are only thought about consciously. Basic-level categorization: The idea that categories are not merely organized in a hierarchy from the most general to the most specific, but are also organized so that the categories that are cognitively basic are "in the middle" of a general-to-specific hierarchy . Generalization proceeds "upward" from the basic level and specialization proceeds "downward." Basic-level primacy: The idea that basic-level categories are functionally and epistemologically primary with respect to the fol­ lowing factors : gestalt perception, image formation, motor move­ ment , knowledge organization, ease of cognitive processing (learn­
ing, recognition, memory , etc. ) , and ease of linguistic expression.
Reference-point, or "m etonymic," reasoning: The idea that a part of a category (that is, a member or subcategory) can stand for the whole category in certain reasoning processes.
What unites these themes is the idea of a cognitive model:
- Cognitive models are d irectly embodied with respect to their content, or else they are systematically linked to d irectly embodied models. Cognitive models structure thought and are used in forming catego­ ries and in reasoning. Concepts characterized by cognitive models are understood via the embodiment of the models.
- Most cogniti\e models are embodied with respect to use. Those that are not are only used consciously and with noticeable effort .
- The nature of conceptual embodiment leads to basic-level categoriza­ tion and basic-level primacy.
- Cognitive models are used in reference-point, or "metonymic," rea­ soning.
- Membersh ip•gradience arises when the cognitive model characterizing a concept contains a scale.
- Centrality gradience arises through the interaction of cognitive mod­ els.
- Family resemblances involve resemblances among models. - Polysemy arises from the fact that there are systematic relationships
between d ifferent cognitive models and between elements of the same model . The same word is often used for elements that stand in such cognitive relations to one another .
Thus it is the concept of a cognitive model , which we will discuss in the re­ mainder of the book , that ties together the themes of this section .

14 Chapter 2
The scholars we will be discussing in this section are those I take to be most representative of the development of these themes :
- Ludwig Wittgenstein is associated with the ideas of family resem­ blance, centrality , and gradience.
- J. L. Austin's views on the relationships among meanings of words are both a cr ystalization of earlier ideas in lexicography and historical semantics and a precursor of the contemporary view of polysemy as involving family resemblances among meanings.
- Lotfi Zadeh began the technical study of categories with fuzzy boundaries by conceiving of a theory of fuzzy sets as a generalization of standard set theory.
- Floyd Lounsbury's generative analysis of kinship categories is an im­ portant link between the idea that a category can be generated by a generator plus rules and the idea that a category has central members (and subcategories)..
- Brent Berlin and Paul Kay are perhaps best known for their research on color categories , which empirically established the id eas of centrality and gradience .
- Paul Kay and Chad McDaniel put together color research from anthropology and neurophysiology and established the importance of the embodiment of concepts and the role that embodiment plays in determining centrality.
- Roger Brown began the study of what later became known as "basic­ level categories ." He observed that there is a "first level" at which children learn object categories and name objects , which is neither the most general nor most specific level . This level is characterized b y distinctive actions, as well as by shorter and more frequently used names . He saw this level of categorization as "natural ," whereas he viewed higher-level and lower-level categorization as "achievements of the imagination ."
- B rent Berlin and his associates, in research on plant and animal nam­ ing, empirically established for these domains many of the fundamen­ tal ideas associated with basic-level categorization and basic-level pri­ macy. They thereby demonstrated that embodiment determines some of the most significant properties of human categories.
- Paul Ekman and his co-workers have shown that there are universal basic human emotions that have physical correlates in facial expres­ sions and the autonomic nervous system. He thereby confirmed such ideas as basic-level concepts, basic-level primacy, and centrality while demonstrating that emotional concepts are embodied.
•

From Wittgenstein to Rosch 15
- Eleanor Rosch saw the generalizations behind such studies of particu­ lar cases and proposed that thought in general is organized in terms of prototypes and basic-level structures. It was Rosch who saw categori­ zation itself as one of the most important issues in cognition . Together with Carolyn Mervis and other co-workers, Rosch established re­ search paradigms in cognitive psychology for demonstrating centra­ lity, family resemblance , basic-level categorization, basic-level pri­ macy , and reference-point reasoning, as well as certain kinds of embodiment. Rosch is perhaps best known for developing experi­ mental paradigms for determining subjects' ratings of how good an example of a category a member is judged to be. Rosch ultimately realized that these ratings do not in themselves constitute models for representing category structure . They are effects that are inconsistent with the classical theory and that place significant constraints on what an adequate account of categorization must be.
These scholars all played a significant role in the histor y of the paradigm we will be presenting. The theory of cognitive models , which we will dis­ cuss later , attempts to bring their contributions into a coherent paradigm.
There are some notable omissions from our short survey. Since graded categories will be of only passing interest to us , I will not be mentioning much of the excellent work in that area . Graded categories are real . To my knowledge , the most detailed empirical study of graded categories is Kempton's thoroughly documented book on cognitive prototypes with graded extensions (Kempton 1981) . It is based on field research in Mexico on the categorization of pottery. I refer the interested reader to that su­ perb work , as well as to Labov's classic 1 973 paper. I will also have rela­ tively little to say about fuzzy set theory, since it is also tangential to our concerns here . Readers interested in the extensive literature that has de­ veloped on the theory of fuzzy sets and systems should consult (Dubois and Prade 1 980) . There is also a tradition of research in cognitive psychol­ ogy that will not be surveyed here. Despite Rosch's ultimate refusal to in­ terpret her goodness-of-example ratings as constituting a representation of category structure , other psychologists have taken that path and have given what I call an EFFECTS = STRUCTURE INTERPRETATION to Rosch's re­ sults . Smith and Medin ( 1980) have done an excellent survey of research in cognitive psychology that is based 011 this interpretation. In chapter 9 below, I will argue that the EFFECTS = STRUCTURE INTERPRETATION is in gen­ eral inadequate.
Let us now turn to our survey.

1 6 Chapter 2
Wittgenstein
Family Resemblances
The first major crack in the classical theory is generally acknowledged to have been noticed by Wittgenstein (1953 , 1 :66-71 ) . The classical category has clear boundaries, which are defined by common properties. Witt­ genstein pointed out that a category like game does not fit the classical mold , since there are no common properties shared by all games . Some games involve mere amusement, like ring-around-the-rosy . Here there is no competition--no winning or losing-though in other games there is . Some games involve luck , like board games where a throw of the dice de­ termines each move. Others, like chess, involve skill. Still others , like gin rummy, involve both.
Though there is no single collection of properties that all games share , the category of games is united by what Wittgenstein calls family resem­ blances. Members of a family resemble one another in various ways: they may share the same build or the same facial features, the same hair color , e ye color, or temperament, and the like . But there need be no single col­ lection of properties shared by everyone in a famil y . Games, in this re­ spect, are like families . Chess and go both involve competition , skill, and the use of long-term strategies. Chess and poker both involve competi­ tion. Poker and old maid are both card games. In short, games , like fam­ ily members , are similar to one another in a wide variety of ways . That, and not a single, well-defined collection of common properties, is what makes game a category .
Extendable Boundaries
Wittgenstein also observed that there was no fixed boundary to the cate­ gor y game. The category could be extended and new kinds of games introduced , provided that they resembled previous games in appropriate ways. The introduction of video games in the 1970s was a recent case in history where the boundaries of the game categor y were extended on a large scale . One can always impose an artificial boundary for some pur­ pose ; what is important for his point is that extensions are possible, as well as artificial limitations. Wittgenstein cites the example of the cate­ gor y number. Historically, numbers were first taken to be integers and were then extended successively to rational numbers, real numbers, com­ plex numbers, transfinite numbers, and all sorts of other kinds of numbers invented by mathematicians. One can for some purpose limit the cate­ gor y number to integers only, or rational numbers only, or real numbers onl y . But the category number is not bounded in any natural way, and it can be limited or extended depending on one's purposes.

Austin 17
In mathematics, intuitive human concepts like number must receive precise definitions . Wittgenstein' s point is that different mathematicians give different precise definitions , depending on their goals. One can define number to include or exclude transfinite numbers , infinitesimals , inaccessible ordinals , and the like. The same is true of the concept of a polyhedron . Lakatos ( 1 976) describes a long history of disputes within mathematics about the properties of polyhedra, beginning with Euler's conjecture that the number of vertices minus the number of edges plus the number of faces equals two. Mathematicians over the years have come up with counterexamples to Euler's conjecture , only to have other mathematicians claim that they had used the "wrong" definition of poly­ hedron. Mathematicians have defined and redefined polyhedron repeat­ edly to fit their goals. The point again is that there is no single well-defined intuitive category polyhedron that includes tetrahedra and cubes and some fixed range of other constructs . The category polyhedron can be given precise boundaries in many ways, but the intuitive concept is not limited in any of those ways; rather , it is open to both limitations and ex­ tensions.
Central and Noncentral Members
According to the classical theory, categories are uniform in the following respect : they are defined by a collection of properties that the categor y members share . Thus , no members should be more central than other members . Yet Wittgenstein's example of number suggests that integers are ce ntral , that they :lave a status as numbers that , say , complex num­ bers or transfinite numbers do not have . Every precise definition of nzan­ ber must include the integers; not every definition must include transfinite numbers. If anything is a number. the integers are numbers; that is not true of transfinite numbers . Similarly , any definition of polyhedra had better include tetrahedra and cubes. The more exotic polyhedra can be included or excluded, depending on your purposes. Wittgenstein suggests that the same is true of games . "Someone says to me : 'Show the child ren a game .' 1 teach them gaming with dice , and the other says 'I d idn't mean that sort of game' " ( 1 :70) . Dice is just not a very good example of a game . The fact that there can be good and bad examples of a category does not follow from the classical- theory. Somehow the good ness-of-example structure needs to be accounted for.
A u st i n
Wittgenstein assumed that there is a single category named by the word game , and he proposed that that category and other categories are struc-

18 Chapter 2
tured by family resemblances and good and bad examples . Philosopher J . L. Austin extended this sort of analysis to the study of words them­ selves . In his celebrated paper, "The Meaning of a Word ," written in 1 940 and published in 1 96 1 , Austin asked, "Why do we call different [kinds of] things by the same name?" The traditional answer is that the kinds of things named are similar, where "similar" means "partially identical." This answer relies on the classical theory of categories . If there are com­ mon properties , those properties form a classical category , and the name applies to this category . Austin argued that this account is not accurate . He cited several classes of cases . As we will see in the remainder of this book, Austin's analysis prefigured much of contemporary cognitive se­ mantics--especially the application of prototype theory to the study of word meaning.
If we translate Austin's remarks into contemporary terms , we can see the relationship between Austin's observation and Wittgenstein's: the senses of a word can be seen as forming a category , with each sense being a member of that category . Since the senses often do not have properties in common , there is no classical category of senses that the word could be naming. However, the senses can be viewed as forming a category of the kind Wittgenstein described . There are central senses and noncentral senses . The senses may not be similar (in the sense of sharing properties) , but instead are related t o one another i n other specifiable ways . I t i s such relationships among the senses that enable those senses to be viewed as constituting a single categor y: the relationships provide an explanation of why a single word is used to express those particular senses. This idea is far from new. Part of the job of traditional historical semanticists , as well as lexicographers , has been to speculate on such relationships . Recent re­ search has taken up this question again in a systematic way. The most de­ tailed contemporary study along these lines has been done by B rugman ( 1 98 1 ) , and it will be discussed below in case study 2.
Let us now turn to Austin's examples :
The adjective 'healthy' : when I talk of a healthy body , and again of a healthy complexion, of healthy exercise: the word is not just being used equivocally . . . there is what we may call a primary nuclear sense of 'healthy' : the sense in which 'healthy' is used of a healthy body: I call this nuclear because it is 'contained as a part' in the other two senses which may be set out as 'productive of healthy bodies' and ' resulting from a healthy body'. . . . Now are we content to say that the exercise, the complexion, and the body are all called 'healthy' because they are similar? Such a remark can­ not fail to be misleading. Why make it? (P. 71)
Austin's primary nuclear sense corresponds to what contemporary lin­ guists call central or prototypical senses . The contained-as-a-part relation-

Austin 19
sh ip is an instance of what we will refer to below as metonymy-where the part stands for the whole. Thus , given the relationships "productive of" and "resulting from," Austin's examples can be viewed in the follow­ ing way :
Exercise of type B is productive of bodies of type A . Complexion of type C results from bodies of type A . The word healthy names A . With respect to naming , A stands for B . (Metonymy) With respect to naming , A stands for C. (Metonymy)
Thus, the word "healthy" has senses A, B , and C. A, B , and C form a cate­ gory whose members are related in the above way . A is the central mem­ ber of this category of senses (Austin's primary nuclear sense) . B and C are extended senses , where metonymy is the principle of extension.
I am interpreting Austin as making an implicit psychological claim about categorization. In the very act of pointing out and analyzing the dif­ ferences among the senses , Austin is presupposing that these senses form a natural collection for speakers-so natural that the senses have to be d ifferentiated by an analyst. No such analysis would be needed for true homonyms, say , bank (where you put your money) and bank (of a river) , which are not part of a natural collection (or category) of senses. In point­ ing out the existence of a small number of mechanisms by which senses are related to one another, Austin is implicitly suggesting that those mechanisms are psychologically real (rather than being j ust the arbitrary machinations of a clever analyst) . He is , after all , trying to explain why people naturally use the same words for different senses . His implicit claim is that these mechanisms are principles which provide a "good rea­ son" for grouping the senses together by the use of the same word . What I have referred to as "metonymy" is just one such mechanism .
From metonymy . Austin turns to what Johnson and I (Lakoff and Johnson 1 980) refer to as metaphor , but which Austin , following Aris­ totle , terms "analogy ."
When A : B : :X: Y then A and X are often called by the same name , e.g. , the foot of a mountain and the foot of a list. Here there is a good reason for calling the things both "feet" but are we to say they are "similar"? Not in any ordinary sense . We may say that the relations in which they stand to B and Y are similar relations. Well and good: but A and X are not the relations in which they stand . (Pp . 71-72)
Austin isn't explicit here , but what seems to be going on is that both mountains and lists are being structured in terms of a metaphorical pro­ jection of the human body onto them. Expanding somewhat on Austin's analysis and translating it into contemporary terminology , we have :

20 Chapter 2
A is the bottom-most part of the body . X is the bottom-most part of the mountain. X' is the bottom-most part of a list. B ody is projected onto mountain , with A projected onto X.
(Metaphor) B ody is projected onto list, with A projected onto X' .
( Metaphor) The word "foot" names A . A, X , and X' form a category, with A as central member . X and X ' are
noncentral members related to A by metaphor.
Austin also notes examples of what we will refer to below as chaining within a category .
Another case is where I call B by the same name as A , because it resembles A , C by the same name because it resembles B , D . . . and so on. But ulti­ mately A and, say D do not resemble each other in any recognizable sense at all. This is a very common case: and the dangers are obvious when we search for something 'identical' in all of them ! (P. 72)
Here A is the primary nuclear sense, and B, C, and D are extended senses forming a chain . A, B, C, and D are all members of the same category of senses, with A as the central member.
Take a word like 'fascist' : this originally connotes a great many characteristics at once : say , x, y, and z. Now we will use 'fascist' subsequently of things which possess only Oile of these striking characteristics. So that things called 'fascist' in these senses, which we may call 'incomplete' senses, need not be similar at all to each other. (P. 72)
This example is very much like one Fillmore (1982a) has recently given in support of the use of prototype theory in lexical semantics . Fillmore takes the verb climb , as in
- John climbed the ladder.
Here , "climbing" includes both motion upward and the use of the hands to grasp onto the thing climbed. However, climbing can involve just mo­ tion upwards and no use of the hands , as in
- The airplane climbed to 20,000 feet.
Or the motion upward may be eliminated if there is grasping of the ap­ propriate sort, as in
- He climbed out onto the ledge .
Such contemporary semantic analyses using prototype theory are very much in the spirit of Austin.

Zadeh 2 1
Fillmore's frame semantics is also prefigured by Austin.
Take the sense in which I talk of a cricket bat and a cricket ball and a cricket umpire. The reason that all are called by the same name is perhaps that each has its part -its own special part-to play in the activity called cricketing: it is no good to say that cricket means simply 'used in cricket' : for we cannot explain what we mean by 'cricket' except by explaining the special parts
played in cricketing by the bat, ball, etc. (P. 73)
Austin here is discussing a holistic structure-a gestalt-governing our understanding of activities like cricket. Such activities are structured by what we call a cognitive model, an overall structure which is more than merely a composite of its parts . A modifier like cricket in cricket bat, cricket ball, cricket umpire, and so on does not pick out any common property or similarity shared by bats , balls , and umpires . It refers to the structured activity as a whole. And the nouns that cricket can modify form a category , but not a category based on shared properties. Rather it is a category based on the structure of the activity of cricket and on those things that are part of the activity . The entities characterized by the cogni­ tive model of cricket are those that are in the category. What defines the category is our structured understanding of the activity .
Cognitive psychologists have recently begun to study categories based on such holistically structured activities. B arsalou ( 1 983, 1 984) has stud­ ied such categories as things to take on a camping trip, foods not to eat on a diet, clothes to wear in the snow , and the like . Such categories , among their other properties , do not show family resemblances among their members.
Like Wittgenstein, Austin was dedicated to showing the inadequacies of traditional philosophical views of language and mind-views that are still widely held . His contribution to prototype theory was to notice for words the kinds of things that Wittgenstein noticed for conceptual catego­ ries. Language is, after all , an aspect of cognition . Following Austin's lead , we will try to show how prototype theory generalizes to the linguis­ tic as well as the nonlinguistic aspects of mind.
Zadeh
Some categories do not have gradations of membership, while others do. The category U. S. Senator is well defined. One either is or is not a sena­ tor . On the other hand , categories l ike rich people or tall men are graded , simply because there are gradations of richness and tallness. Lotfi Zadeh ( 1 965) devised a form of set theory to model graded categories . He called it fuzzy set theory. In a classical set, everything is either in the set (has membership value 1) or is outside the set (has membership value 0) . In a

22 Chapter 2
fuzzy set, as Zadeh defined it , additional values are allowed between 0 and 1 . This corresponds to Zadeh's intuition that some men are neither clearly tall nor clearly short , but rather in the middle-tall to some de­ gree.
In the original version of fuzzy set theory , operations on fuzzy sets are simple generalizations of operations on ordinary sets :
Suppose element x has membership value v in fuzzy set A and membership value w in fuzzy set B.
Intersection : The value of x in A n B is the minimum of v and w. Union: The value of x in A U B is the maximum of v and w. Complement: The value of x in the complement of A is 1 - v.
It is a natural and ingenious extension of the classical theory of sets . Since Zadeh's original paper, other definitions for union and intersec­
tion have been suggested. For an example, see Goguen 1969 . The best discussion of attempts to apply fuzzy logic to natural language is in Mc­ Cawley 198 1 .
Lou nsbu r y
Cognitive anthropology has had an important effect on the development of prototype theory, beginning with Floyd Lounsbury's ( 1964) studies of American Indian kinship systems. Take the example of Fox, in which the word nehcihsiihA is used not only to refer to one's maternal uncle-that is , one's mother's mother's son-but also to one's mother's mother's son's son, one's mother's mother's father's son's son , one's mother'� brother's son , one's mother's brother's son's son, and a host of other rela­ tives . The same sort of treatment also occurs for other kinship categories . There are categories of "fathers ," "mothers ," sons ," and "daughters" with j ust as diverse a membership.
The Fox can , of course , distinguish uncles from great-uncles from nephews . But they are all part of the same kinship category, and thus are named the same. Lounsbury discovered that such categories were struc­ tured in terms of a "focal member" and a small set of general rules extending each category to nonfocal members . The same rules apply across all the categories. The rules applying in Fox are what Lounsbury called the "Omaha type":
Skewing rule: Anyone's father's sister, as a linking relative, is equiva­ lent to that person's sister.
Merging rule: Any person's sibling of the same sex , as a linking rela­ tive , is equivalent to that person himself.

Lounsbury 23

Half-sibling rule: Any child of one of one's parents is one's sibling.
The condition "as a linking relative" is to prevent the rule from applying directly ; instead, there must be an intermediate relative between ego (the reference point) and the person being described . For example, the skew­ ing rule does not say that a person's paternal aunt is equivalent to his sis­ ter. B ut it does say , for example, that his father's paternal aunt is equiva­ lent to his father's sister. In this case , the intermediate relative is the father.
These rules have corollaries. For example ,

Skewing corollary : The brother's child of any female l inking relative is equivalent to the sibling of that female linking relative . (For example , a mother's brather's daughter is equivalent to a mother's sister. )

Lounsbury illustrates how such rules would work for the Fox maternal uncle category. We will use the following abbreviations : M: mother, F: father , B : brother, S: sister, d: daughter, s: son . Let us consider the fol­ lowing examples of the nehcihsiihA (mother's brother) category, and the equivalence rules that make them part of this category. Lounsbury's point in these examples is to take a very distant relative and show precisely how the same general rules place that relative in the MB (mother's brother) category. Incidentally , all the intermediate relatives in the following cases are also in the MB category�.g . , MMSs, that is , mother's mother's s ister's son , etc . Let "--7 " stand for "is equivalent to."

S im ilarly , the other "uncles" in Fox are equivalent to MB. Not all conceptual systems for categorizing kinsmen have the same skewing rules . Lounsbury also cites the Crow version of the skewing rule :
Skewing rule: Any woman's brother, as a l inking relative , is equivalent to that woman's son, as a linking relative.

24 Chapter 2

Skewing corollary: The sister of any male linking relative is equivalent to the mother of that male linking relative.
These rules are responsible for some remarkable categorizations. One's paternal aunt's son is classified as one's "father." But one's paternal aunt's daughter is classified as one's "grandmother" ! Here are the deriva­ tions :

Moreover , Lounsbury observed that these categories were not mere mat­ ters of naming. Such things as inheritance and social responsibilities fol­ low category lines.
Categories of this sort-with a central member plus general rules-are by no means the norm in language , as we shall see . Yet they do occur. We will refer to such a category as a generative category and to its central member as a generator. A generative category is characterized by at least one generator plus something else: it is the "something else" that takes
the generator as input and yields the entire category as output It may be either a general principle like similarity or general rules that apply else­ where in the system or specific rules that apply only in that categor y . In Lounsbury's cases , the "something else" is a set of rules that apply throughout the kinship system. The generator plus the rules generate the catego r y .
In such a category , the generator has a special status. It is the best ex­ ample of the category, the model on which the category as a whole is built. It is a special case of a prototype.

Berlin and Kay
The next major contribution of cognitive anthropology to prototype the­ ory was the color research of Brent Berlin and Paul Kay . In their classic , Basic Color Terms (Berlin and Kay 1969) , they took on the traditional view that different languages could carve up the color spectrum in arbi­ trary ways . The first regularity they found was in what they called basic color terms. For a color term to be basic,

Berlin and Kay 25
- It must consist of only one morpheme , like green , rather than more than one , as in dark green or grass-colored.
- The color referred to by the term must not be contained within an­ other color. Scarlet is , for example , contained within red.
- It must not be restricted to a small number of objects . Blond, for ex­ ample , is restricted to hair, wood , and perhaps a few other things.
- It must be common and generally known , like yellow as opposed to saffron .
Once one distinguishes basic from nonbasic color terms , generalizations appear .
- B asic color terms name basic color categories, whose central members are the same universally. For example , there is always a psychologi­ cally real category RED , with focal red as the best , or "purest ," exam­ ple .
- The color categories that basic color terms can attach to are the equivalents of the English color categories named by the terms black, white, red, yellow, green, blue, brown, purple, pink, orange and gray.
- Although people can conceptually d ifferentiate all these color catego­ ries , it is not the case that all languages make all of those d ifferentia­ tions . Many languages have fewer basic categories . Those categories include unions of the basic categories ; for example , B LUE + GREEN, RED + ORANGE + YELLOW , etc. When there are fewer than eleven basic color terms in a language , one basic term , or more , names such a union.
- Languages form a hierarchy based on the number of basic color terms they have and the color categories those terms refer to.
Some languages , like English, use all eleven , while others use as few as two. When a language has only two basic color terms, they are black and white-which might more appropriately be called cool (covering black , blue , green, and gray) and warm (covering white , yellow, orange , and red) . When a language has three basic color terms , they are black, white , and red. When a language has four basic color terms , the fourth is one of the following: yellow, blue, or green. The possibilities for four-calor-term languages are thus : black, white, red, yellow; black, white, red, blue; and black, white, red, green . And so on, down the following hierarchy :
black, white red yellow , blue , green brown purple, pink, orange , gray

What made it possible for Berlin and Kay to find these regularities was their discovery of focal colors. If one simply asks speakers around the world to pick out the portions of the spectrum that their basic color terms refer to, there seem to be no significant regularities. The boundaries be­ tween the color ranges differ from language to language . The regularities appear only when one asks for the best example of a basic color term given a standardized chart of 320 small color chips. Virtually the same best ex­ amples are chosen for the basic color terms by speakers in language after language . For example , in languages that have a basic term for colors in the blue range , the best example is the same focal blue for all speakers no matter what language they speak. Suppose a language has a basic color term that covers the range of both blue and green ; let us call that color grue. The best example of grue, they claim , will not be tur­ quoise, which is in the middle of the blue-to-green spectrum. Instead the best example of grue will be either focal blue or focal green. The focal colors therefore allow for comparison of terms across languages.
The existence of focal colors shows that color categories are not uni­ form. Some members of the category RED are better examples of the cate­ gory than others. Focal red is the best example . Color categories thus have central members. There is no general principle , however, for pre­ dicting the boundaries from the central members . They seem to vary, somewhat arbitrarily, from language to language .
Kay and McDaniel The Berlin-Kay color research raised questions that were ' left un­ answered . What determines the collection of universal focal colors? Why should the basic color terms pick out just those colors? Kay and Mc­ Daniel ( 1978) provided an answer to these questions that depended j ointly on research on the neurophysiology of color vision by DeValois and his associates and on a slightly revised version of Zadeh's fuzzy set theory.
DeValois and his associates (DeValois, Abramov, and Jacobs 1966 ; DeValois and Jacobs 1968) had investigated the neurophysiology of color vision in the macaque , a monkey with a visual system similar to man's . Their research concentrated on the neural pathways between the eye and the brain. They found six types of cell. Four of these , called opponent re­ sp onse cells, determine hue , while the other two determine brightness . The opponent response cells are grouped into two pairs, one having to do with the perception of blue and yellow, the other having to do with the perception of red and green. Each opponent response cell has a spontane­ ous rate of firing-a base response rate that it maintains without any ex-

Kay and McDaniel 27
ternal stimulation. There are two types of blue-yellow cells . The + B Y cells fire above their base rate in response to a blue stimulus, and below their base rate in response to a yellow stimulus . The + Y - B cells do the re­ verse: they fire above their base rate in response to yellow and below their base rate in response to blue . Similarly , there are two types of red-green cells : + G - R cells fire above their base rate in response to green and be­ low in response to red, while + R - G cells fire above in response to red and below in response to green. The two types of blue-yellow cells jointly de­ termine a blue-yellow response, while the two kinds of red-green cells jointly determine a red-green response.
Focal blue is perceived when the blue-yellow cells show a blue response and when the red-green cells are firing at the neutral base rate . Purple is a combination of blue and red ; it is perceived when the blue-yellow cells show a blue response and the red-green cells show a red response. Tur­ quoise is perceived when the blue-yellow cells show a blue response and the red-green cells show a green response . Pure primary colors-blue , yellow, red , and green-are perceived when either the blue-yellow or red­ green cells are firing at their neutral base rates . Nonprimary colors corre­ spond to cases where no opponent cells are firing at neutral base rates.
The remaining two kinds of cells are light-sensitive and darkness­ sensitive . Pure black , white , and gray are perceived when the blue-yellow and red-green cells are all firing at their neutral base rates and making no color contribution . Pure black occurs when the darkness-sensitive cells are firing at their maximum rate and the light-sensitive cells are firing at their minimum rates . Pure white is the reverse.
Given these results from neurophysiological studies , Kay and McDan­ iel apply a version of fuzzy set Theory to make sense of the Kay-Berlin re­ sults. For example , they define degree of membership in the category blue as the proportion of blue response on the part of the blue-yellow cells . Pure blue (degree of membership = 1) occurs when the red-green re�ponse is neutral . Blues in the direction of purple or green or white have an inter­ mediate degree of membership in the blue category. Corresponding definitions are given for other primary colors.

grams give curves that correlate degree of membership in color categories with wavelengths in nanometers for hues and percentage of reflectance for black and white.
The neurophysiological account only characterizes the primary colors : bl ack , white, red , yellow , blue, and green. What allows us ta "see" other colors as being members of color categories? What about orange, brown ,

purple, etc. ? Some cognitive mechanism in addition to the neurophysiol­ ogy is needed to account for those . Kay and McDaniel suggested that such a mechanism would make use of something akin to fuzzy set theory .
The postulation o f a cognitive mechanism that has some of the effects of fuzzy set theory enables Kay and McDaniel to do two things that the neurophysiological account alone could not do. First, it enables them to characterize focal nonprimary colors (orange, purple, pink, brown, gray , etc . ) in the following intuitive way :

and ORANGE = RED

Y E L LOW

and PURPLE = B LU E

RED

and PINK = RED

WHITE

and BROWN = BLACK

YELLOW

and GRAY = BLACK

WHITE

Thus , ORANGE is characterized in terms of the fuzzy set intersection of the RED and YELLOW curves . (Actually , for technical reasons the definition is twice the fuzzy-set intersection value. See Kay and McDaniel 1978 , pp . 634-35 , for details . ) Correspondingly , PURPLE is defined in terms of the fuzzy set intersection of BLUE and RED , and GRAY in terms of the fuzzy set in­ tersection for BLACK and WHITE. PINK and BROWN require somewhat differ­ ent functions based on fuzzy set intersections .
The second advantage of fuzzy set theory is that it permits an intuitive account of basic color categories that include more than one focal color. Dani , for example, has only two basic color terms: mili contains black and all the cool colors , the greens and blues ; mala contains white and all the warm colors, the reds, oranges , yellows, pinks , and red-purples. Some

Kay and McDaniel 29
languages have basic color categories containing both blues and greens , while others have basic color categories containing both reds and yellows . Such cases can be accounted for intuitively by using fuzzy set union.
DARK-COOL = BLACK or GREEN or BLUE LIGHT-WARM = W H ITE or RED or YELLOW COOL = GREEN or B LUE WARM = RED or YELLOW
Thus, Kay and McDaniel make the claim that basic color categories are a product of both neurophysiology and cognitively real operations that can be partially modelled by fuzzy set intersection and union.
At present, this is the only plausible account we have of why the facts of basic color categories should be as they are. The Kay-McDaniel theory has important consequences for human categorization in general . It claims that colors are not objectively "out there in the world" indepen­ dent of any beings . Color concepts are embodied in that focal colors are partly determined by human biology. Color categorization makes use of human biology , but color categories are more than merely a conseque nce of the nature of the world plus human biology. Color categories result from the world plus human biology plus a cognitive mechanism that has some of the characteristics of fuzzy set theory plus a culture-specific choice of which basic color categories there are .
The Kay-McDaniel theory seems to work well for characterizing the focal colors corresponding to basic color categories . But it does not work as well at the boundar:-=s between colors . According to the Kay­ McDaniel account, the boundaries , as well as the focal colors , should be uniform across languages . But this is simply not the case. The most de­ tailed work on the detailed mapping of color categories , especially in non­ focal areas , has been done by MacLaury (in preparation) . Among the test cases for the Kay-McDaniel theory are cases where a language does not have a separate color category for nonprimary focal colors, like purple and orange , colors that , in the Kay-McDaniel account, are "computed" on the basis of fuzzy set theory plus the response curves for the primary colors . The Kay-McDaniel theory predicts that colors like purple and or­ ange should be treated uniformly across languages and that they should always be on the boundaries between basic color categories in languages that do not have separate categories for them.
B ut Macl,aury has found cases where purple is entirely within the cool color range (a single color with focal points at blue and green) and other cases where purple is on the boundary between cool and red . He has also found cases where brown is subsumed by yellow and other cases where it is subsumed by black . That is , what we call "brown" falls within the range

30 Chapter 2
of a category with a center at pure yellow in some languages , and it falls within the range of a category with a center at pure black in other lan­ guages.
In Kay- McDaniel terms , this means that the fuzzy-set-theoretical func­ tions that compute conjunctions and disjunctions for color categories are not exactly the same for all people; rather they vary in their boundary conditions from culture to culture. They are thus at least partly conven­ tional , and not completely a matter of universal neurophysiology and cognition. What this requires is a revision of the Kay-McDaniel theory to permit conceptual systems for color to vary at the boundaries , by having the exact nature of the disjunction function be somewhat different in dif­ ferent systems. Such differences may not only be at the boundaries but at the focal peaks . Kay and McDaniel's theory implied that each binary dis­
j unctive color category (e.g. , COOL :;:= BLUE or GREEN) should have two focal
peaks (e.g . , both focal blue and focal green) . MacLaury has found cases where there is a cool category covering blue and green , but where there is a skewing effect such that the center of the category is at pure green alone or pure blue alone . Thus, in Kay-McDaniel terms , conceptual systems seem to have disjunction functions that take the blue and green response curves as input and yield an output curve with only one focal center. This would require a cognitive mechanism with more than just something akin to the operation of union in fuzzy set theory.
Color categories , thus , are generative categories in the same sense in which kinship categories characterized by Lounsbury are . They have generators plus something else. The generators are the neurophysiologi­ cally determined distribution functions , which have peaks where the pri­ mary colors are pure: black , white, red , yellow, blue , and green. These generators are universal; they are part of human neurophysiology . The "something else" needed to generate a system of basic color categories consists of a complex cognitive mechamism incorporating some of the characteristics of fuzzy set theory union and intersection. This cognitive mechanism has a small number of parameters that may take on different values in different cultures .
It is important to bear in mind that it is not just the names for colors that vary. The color names do not just attach to the neurophysiologically determined distribution functions directly. Cognitive mechanisms of the sort described above must be postulated in addition. There are general characteristics of the cognitive mechanisms, for example , the use of something like fuzzy set theory union and intersection. But, as MacLaury shows, color cognition is by no means all the same across cultures. Nor is it by any means arbitrarily different across cultures . The possible color
ranges depend upon limited parameters within the cognitive mechanism .

Brown and Berlin 3 1
B rown and B erlin: Glimpses of the B asic Level
The study of basic-level categories is usually traced to Roger Brown's classic paper, "How Shall a Thing Be Called?" (1 958) , and his textbook, Social Psychology ( 1 965 , pp. 3 17-2 1 ) .
Brown observed that objects have many names: "The dime in my pocket is not only a dime. It is also money, a metal object, a thing, and , moving to subordinates , it is a 1952 dime , in fact, a particular 1 952 dime with a unique pattern of scratches , discolorations , and smooth places . The dog on the lawn is not only a dog but is also a boxer, a quadruped, an animate being" (Brown 1�58, p. 14) . Brown also observed that of alJ the possible names for something in a category hierarchy , a particular name , at a particular level of categorization , "has a superior status ." "While a dime can be called a coin or money or a 1 952 dime, we somehow feel that dime is its real name . The other categorizations seem like achievements of the imagination" (Brown 1965 , p. 320) . Such "real names ," Brown ob­ served, seem to be shorter and to be used more frequently . They also seem to correlate with nonlinguistic actions.
When Lewis' SOil first looked upon the yellow jonquils in a bowl and heard them named flowers he was also enjoined to smell them and we may guess that his mother leaned over and did just that. When a ball is named ball it is also likely to be bounced. When a cat is named kitty it is also likely to be petted . Smelling and bouncing and petting are actions distinctively linked to certain categories. We can be sure they are distinctive because they are able to function as symbols of these categories. In a game of charades one might symbolize cat by stroking the air at a suitable height in a certain fashion , or symbolize flower by inclining forward and sniffing.
Flowers are marked by sniffing actions , but there are no actions that distin­ guish one species of flower from another. The first names given to things fall at the level of distinctive action but names go on to code the world at every level ; non-linguistic actions do not.
When something is categorized it is regarded as equivalent to certain other things. For what purposes equivalent? How are all dimes equivalent or all flowers or all cats? . . . Dimes are equivalent in that they can be exchanged for certain newspapers or cigars or ice cream cones or for any two nickels . In fact , they are equivalent for all purposes of economic exchange . Flowers are equivalent in that they are agreeable to smell and are pickable. Cats are equivalent in that they are to be petted, but gently , so that they do not claw. (Brown 1965 , pp. 3 1 8-19)

The picture Brown gives is that categorization , for a child , begins " at the

level then

of distinctive action ," proceeds upward to su

ptehreolredvinelatoefcfalotewgeorrsieasn(dlikcaetpslaanndt adnidmaensimaanld)

and downward to subordinate categories (like jonquil and Siamese) by

" achievements of the imagination." "For these latter categories there

seem to be no characterizing actions" (Brown 1965 , p. 321) . This "first

level " of categorization was seen by Brown as having the following con­

verging properties:

- It is the level of distinctive actions.
- It is the level which is learned earliest and at which things are first named .
- It is the level at which names are shortest and used most frequentl y . - It is a natural level of categorization , as opposed t o a level created b y
"achievements of the imagination."

The next important impetus to the study of basic-level categories came from the work of Brent Berlin and his associates . Berlin 's research can be viewed as a response to the classical philosophical view that THE CATE­ GORIES OF MIND FIT THE CATEGORIES OF THE WORLD , and to a linguistic ver­ sion of this , THE DOCTRINE OF NATURAL KIND TERMS. That doctrine states that the world consists very largely of natural kinds of things and that natural languages contain names (called "natural kind terms") that fit those natural kinds. Typical examples of natural kinds are COws, dogs , tigers , gold, silver, water, etc.
Berlin takes these philosophical doctrines as empirically testable Issues and asks : To what extent do the categories of mind (as expressed in lan­ guage) fit the categories of the world? In particular, Berlin considers do­ mains in which there are natural kinds of things: the domains of plants and animals. Moreover, botany and zoology can reasonably be taken to have determined to a high degree of scientific accuracy j ust what kinds of plants and animals there are. Since Berlin is an anthropologist who stud­ ies people who live close to nature and who know an awful lot about plants and animals, he is in an excellent position to test such philosophical doctrines empirically.
Berlin and his students and associates have studied folk classification of plants and animals in incredibly minute detail and compared those cl assi­
fications with scientific classifications. Most of the research has been car­ ried out with speakers of Tzeltal living in Tenejapa in the Chiapas region
of Mexico. This enormous undertaking has been documented
meticulously in Principles of Tzeltal Plant Classification (Berlin , Breed­ love , and Raven 1974) , Tzeltal Folk Zoology (Hunn 1977) , and "Lan-

Brown and Berlin 33
guage Acquisition by Tenejapa Tzeltal Children" (Stross 1 969) . The re­ sults to date have been surprising and have formed the basis for the psychological research on basic-level categorization.
What Berlin and his co-workers discovered was that a single level of classification-the genus-was for Tzeltal speakers psychologically basic in a certain number of ways . Examples of plants and animals at the genus level are oak, maple, rabbit, raccoon , etc. The first way that the priority of the genus manifested itself was in a simple naming task . Berlin went out into the jungle with a native consultant, stopped on the path , and asked the consultant to name the plants he could see . The consultant could eas­ ily name forty or fifty, but he tended to name them at the level of the genus (oak, maple, etc.) instead of the level of the species (sugar maple, live oak) , even though further study showed he could distinguish the species and had names for them. Nor did he name them at the level of the life form (tree) , nor at an intermediate level (needle-bearing tree) . The level of the genus is , incidentally, "in the middle" of the folk classification hier­ archy , the levels being:
UNIQUE BEGINNER (plant, animal) LIFE FORM (tree, bush , bird , fish) INTERMEDIATE (leaf-bearing tree, needle-bearing tree) GENUS (oak, maple) SPECIES (sugar maple, white oak) VARIETY (cutleaf staghorn sumac)
Further study revealed tLat this was no accident and that the level of the genus (what B erlin called the " folk-generic level ") seems to be a psy­ chologically basic level in the following respects:
- People name things more readily at that level. - Languages have simpler names for things at that level . - Categories at that level have greater cultural significance . - Things are remembered more readily at that level . - At that level , things are perceived holistically , as a single gestalt,
while for identification at a lower level , specific details (called distinc­ tive features) have to be picked out to distinguish, for example, among the kinds of oak.
In addition , Stross ( 1969) , in a study of Tzeltal language acquisition , dis­ covered that "the bulk of the child's first-learned plant names are generic names and that from this starting point he continues to differentiate no­ menclaturally , while cognitively he continues to differentiate and generalize plants simultaneously ." In other words , the basic-level (or ge-

34 Chapter 2
neric) categories, which are in the middle of the taxonomic hierarchy, are learned first; then children work up the hierarchy generalizing, and down the hierarchy specializing. Thus , we can add the finding:
- Children learn the names for things at that level earlier.
But perhaps the most remarkable finding of all was this:
- Folk categories correspond to scientific categories extremely accurately at this level, but not very accurately at other levels.
This says something very remarkable about THE DOCTRINE OF NATURAL KIND TERMS: For the Tzeltal , this doctrine works very well at the level of the genus , but not very well at other levels of classification , e.g. , the inter­ mediate, the species, and the variety levels.
But now if one considers philosophical discussions of natural kinds , it turns out that this is not such a surprising result after all . In the literature on natural kinds, one finds that the usual examples of natural kinds are animals like dog, cow, tiger, and substances like gold and water. As it hap­ pens, they are all basic-level categories ! In short, the examples on which the doctrine of natural kinds was based were all basic level , which is the level of the genus among plants and animals. At least for the Tzeltal , the doctrine works wel l for the kinds of examples that philosophers had in mind when they espoused the doctrine. For other kinds of examples , it does not work very well .
But if THE DOCTRINE OF NATURAL KIND TERMS fits well for the Tzeltal at even one level of categorization , it still seems to be quite a remarkable result . It suggests that there is one psychologically relevant level at which THE CATEGORIES OFTHE MIND FIT THE CATEGORIES OF THE WORLD . However , Berlin's research into the history of biological classification shows this re­ sult to be much less remarkable. Scientific classification in biology grew out of folk classification . And when Linnaeus classified the living things of the world , he specifically made use of psychological criteria in establish­ ing the level of the genus. This comes across particularly clearly in A. J. Cain's 1958 essay " Logic and Memory in Linnaeus's System o f Taxon­ omy" ( 1 958) . The heart of the Linnaean system was the genus , not the species . It is the genus that gives the general characteristics and the species that is defined in terms of differentiating characteristics . But what is a general characteristic? As Cain observes , "The Essential Character of a genus is that which gives some characteristic peculiar to it, if there is one such , which will instantly serve to distinguish it from all others in the natural order" (p. 148) . This is a psychologically defined notion of an "essential character" ; which characteristics can be instantly distinguished

Brown and Berlin 35
depends on the perceptual systems of the beings doing the distinguishing. As Linnaeus's son writes ,
My Father's secret art of determining (delimiting) genera in such a way the S pecies should not become genera? This was no other than his practice in knowing a plant from its external appearance (externa facie) . Therefore he often deviated from his own principles in such a way that variation as to the number of parts . . . did not disturb him, if only the character of the genus . . . could be preserved . Foreigners don't do so , but as soon as a plant has a different splitting (cleavage) of the corolla and calyx, or if the number of sta­ mens and pistils . . . varies, they make a new genus. . . . If possible he [Linnaeus] tried to build the character genericus on the cleavage of the fruit so that all species that constitute a genus should have the same shape of their fruit. (Cain , p. 159)
Why did Linnaeus use the shape of the fruit as a basis for defining the genus? As Cain observes , "The characters chosen from the fructification were clearly marked, readily appreciated, easily described in words , and usually determinable on herbarium specimens" (p. 152) . In other words, the shape of the fruit was easy to perceive and describe . Genera, as Lin­ naeus conceived of them, were "practical units of classification" upon which all biologists should be able to agree; it was important that they should " not become confused and indistinct in the mind" (Cain , p. 1 56) . Most of Linnaeus's rules of nomenclature "follow directly from [the] re­ quirement that the botanist must know and remember all genera" (Cain, p. 162)-again a psychological requirement. "Linnaeus states explicitly and repeatedly that the botanist . . . [andl the zoologist too must know all genera and commit their names to memory" (Cain, p. 156) . Linnaeus also assumed, of course, that this practical system would also be "natu­ ral ," in short , a convergence between nature and psychology could be taken for granted at this level.
In short , the genus was established as that level of biological disconti­ nuity at which human beings could most easily perceive , agree on, learn, remember, and name the discontinuities . The genus, as a scientific level of classification , was set up because it was the most psychologically basic level for the purposes of the study of taxonomic biology by human beings . It ,vas assumed that this would also fit certain real discontinuities in nature . Berlin found that there is a close fit at this level between the cate­ gories of Linnaean biology and basic-level categories in folk biology . This fit follows in part from the criteria used to set up the level of the genus in Linnaean biology ; those criteria correspond to the psychological criteria that characterize the basic level in folk biology.

36 Chapter 2
At the level of the genus, the categories of mind of the biologists who set up the level of the genus correspond closely to the basic-level cate­ gories of mind of Tzeltal speakers. But this is not merely a fact about psy­ chology . It is a fact about both psychology and biology . Here is the reason : Within scientific biology, the genus is one level above the species-the level defined by interbreeding possibilities : two populations that are members of the same species can breed and produce fertile off­ spring. Typically, members of two populations that can interbreed have pretty much the same overall shape. In the course of evolution, two popu­ lations of the same species may change sufficiently so that interbreeding is no longer possible. At the point at which they cease to be able to inter­ breed , they become different species. But at this point they may still have pretty much the same overall shape . They will no longer be members of the same species , but they will be members of the same genus-the cate­ gory one level up. Thus, one level up from the species in scientific biology, it is common to find certain general shape similarities. It may not always happen , but it is common.
Now overall shape is a major determinant of the basic level in folk bio­ logy . The basic level is primarily characterized by gestalt perception (the perception of overall shape) , by imaging capacity (which depends on overall shape) , and by motor interaction (the possibilities for which are also determined by overall shape). It is anything but an accident that the level of the genus in scientific biology should correspond so welJ to the ba­
sic level in folk biology. Moreover, given the experience of people like the Tzeltal , who are in­
digenous to a circumscribed geographical area, there is a good reason why divisions in nature at the level of the genus should be particularly striking. In the course of evolution, the species that survive in a particular geographical region are those that adapt most successfuly to the local en­ vironment . Thus , for each genus , it is common for there to be only one species representing the genus locally . This does not always happen , but it does happen frequently. Thus, there tend to be genus-sized gaps among the species that occur locally-and these are very striking and perceptible gaps . Thus , divisions at the basic level in folk biology correspond to very striking discontinuities in nature for people in a circumscribed geographi­ cal area.
In summary, ethnobiological research has established that there is, at least for biological categories, a basic level of categorization. Among the Tzeltal , who have an intimate familiarity with a large range of plants and animals, the categories of the mind fit discontinuities in the world very well at the level of the genus, though not very well at other levels. The reason for this is partly because the level of the genus, as a fundamental

Brown and Berlin 37
level used in scientific biology , is a psychologically based level of categori­ zation. B ut there are equally important biological reasons.
Basic-level categorization depends upon experiential aspects of human psychology: gestalt perception, mental imagery, motor activities , social function , and memory. (What I call "memory" here is the ability of a sub­ ject in a psychological test to recall on demand particular presented in­ stances of the categor y.) To what extent is basic-level categorization uni­ versal? If we assume that human physiology and psychology are pretty much the same around the world, then any variation would most likely be due to culture and context . But how much variation would there be and what kind would it be?
Berlin has suggested (personal communication) that a distinction be made between a general human capacity for basic-level categorization (due to general physiological and psychological factors) and functional basic-level categorization , which adds in factors having to do with culture and specialized training. Berlin suggests that a given culture may under­ utilize certain human capacities used in basic-level categorization , for ex­ ample , the capacity for gestalt perception . Thus , in urban cultures, peo­ ple may treat the category tree as basic level. Such cases have been documented by Dougherty ( 1978) . Moreover, there may be subpopula­ tions of specialists in a culture who, through training, may achieve a more !indy honed gesta lt perception for a limited range of domains , e . g . , breeds of horses , types of cars , etc . But this should be possible only in a limited number of domains , even for trained specialists . Berlin thus hy­
pothesizes two kinds of nonuni- 'ersality: (a) one kind due to cultural un­
derutilization of general human capacities , with the result that certain higher-level categories (e.g. , tree) may be treated as basic, and (b) an­ other kind due to special training, limited to subpopulations of experts who may treat a slightly more specific level as basic in some domains of expertise .
Berlin's hypothesis makes the following prediction: People from , say , an urban culture that treats trees as basic level should still have the gen­ eral human capacity for gestalt perception and should thus be capable of learning to discriminate among trees readily at the level of the genus, but not so readily at the level of the species or variety . Berlin's hypothesis also predicts that there will be no whole cultures that will treat the level of the species or variety as basic , but that individuals may have a capacity for expertise in a limited range of domains and thus may be able to treat a smal l number of more specific categories as basic.
Berlin also predicts that there will be no culture where all the levels of categorization are different from ours or from the Tzeltal . In most do­ mains , levels of categorization will be the same for all human beings, sim-

38 Chapter 2
ply because human beings share the same general capacities for gestalt perception and for holistic motor movement. It is these capacities that have the major role in determining basic-level categorization.
Basicness in categorization has to do with matters of human psychol­ ogy : ease of perception, memory, learning, naming, and use. Basicness of level has no objective status external to human beings. It is constant only to the extent that the relevant human capacities are utilized in the same way . Basicness varies when those capacitie� either are underutilized in a culture Or are specially developed to a level of expertise.
As we shall see below, Berlin's results have a special philosophical im­ portance . Berlin showed that human categorizations based on interac­ tions with the environment are extremely accurate at the basic level . B asic­ level interactions thus provide a crucial link between cognitive structure and real k nowledge of the world . We will argue in chapter 17 that basic­ level interactions can therefore form the basis of an epistemology for a philosophy of mind and language that is consistent with the results of pro­ totype theory.
Ekman
In research spanning more than two decades , Paul Ekm an and his associ­ ates have studied in detail the physiological correlates of emotions (Ek­ man 197 1 ; Ekman, Friesen, and Ellsworth 1972) . In a major crosscultural study of facial gestures expressing emotion , Ekman and his associates dis­ co , ered that there were basic emotions that seem to correlate universally with facial gestures: happiness , sadness, anger, fear, surprise , and inter­ est. Of all the subtle emotions that people feel and have words and con­ cepts for around the world, only these have consistent correlates in facial expressions across cultures.
Although Ekman was by no means a prototype theorist, his research fits prototype research in the following way. The seven basic emotions ap­ pear to have prototype status. There are many shades and varieties of happiness , sadness, anger, etc. These form categories of emotions. Rage and annoyance, for example, are in the anger category. Basic happiness , anger , etc.-the emotions that correlate with the universal facial ges­ tures-seem to function as central members of those categories. These emotions also appear to have basic-level status . They are readily recognizable by gestalt perception around the world. We have facial im­ ages and motor movements for them that represent the entire emotional category.
As we will see below in case study 1, emotional concepts are embodied, in that the physiology corresponding to each emotion has a great deal to

Rosch 39
do with how the emotion is conceptualized . We will see, for example, that anger is metaphorically understood in terms of heat and internal pres­ sure. Ekman, Levenson, and Friesen (1983) have shown that there is au­
tonomic nervous system (ANS) activity that corresponds to the basic
emotions. The ANS activity that corresponds to anger is an increase in
skin temperature and an increase in heart rate (experienced as internal
pressure) . The experiments that demonstrated this involved two tasks . In the first,
subj ects were instructed to change their facial expressions, muscle by muscle, until their expressions matched the facial prototypes of emotions. In the second, subjects were asked to relive emotional experiences. Heart rate and left- and right-finger temperatures were recorded.
Two findings were consistent across tasks :
(i) Heart rate increased more in anger (mean calculated across tasks ± stan­
dard error, + 8.0 ± 1 .8 beats per minute) and fear ( + 8.0 ± 1 . 6 beats per
minute) than in happiness ( + 2. 6 ± 1 . 0 beat per minute) .
(ii) Left- and right-finger temperatures increased more in anger (left, + 0. 100e ± 0.009°; right, + 0.08° ± 0.008°C) than in happiness (left,
- o.ore ± 0.002° ; right , - 0.03° ± 0.002°) . (Ekman , Levenson , and
Friesen 1983 , p. 1 209)
Thus the metaphorical conceptualization of anger that we will explore in case study 1 is actually embodied in the autonomic nervous system , in that it is motivated by ANS activity that corresponds to the emotions as fe l t .
Rosch
The studies cited above are all special cases. It was Eleanor Rosch who first provided a general perspective on all these problems. She developed what has since come to be called "the theory of prototypes and basic-level categories," or "prototype theory." In doing so , she provided a full-scale challenge to the classical theory and did more than anyone else to estab­ lish categorization as a subfield of cognitive psychology. Before her work, the classical theory was taken for granted , not only in psychology , but in linguistics, anthropology, and philosophy, as well as other disciplines. In a series of electrifying papers, Rosch and her associates presented an overwhelming array of empirical studies that challenged the classical view.
The experimental contributions of Rosch and her associates are gener­ ally and justly recognized by cognitive psychologists as having revolution­ ized the study of categorization within experimental psychology. Rosch's

40 Chapter 2
experimental results fall into two categories: prototype effects, which ex­ tend the Berlin -Kay color research , and basic-level effects, which generalize Brown's observations and Berlin's results .
Prototype Effects
If the classical theory were both correct and complete , no member of a category would have any special status . The reason is that, in the classical theor y, the properties defining the category are shared by all members , and so all members have equal status as category members. Rosch's re­ search on prototype effects has been aimed at showing asymmetries among category members and asymmetric structures within categories. Since the classical theory does not predict such asymmetries, either some­ thing more or something different must be going on.
Rosch's early studies were on color. She learned of the Berlin-Kay color research midway through her own research and found that their re­ sults meshed with her own work on Dani, a New Guinea language that has only two basic color categories: mili (dark-cool , including black , green , and blue) and mala (light-warm, including white , red, yellow) . Berlin and Kay had shown that focal colors had a special status within color categoraies-that of the best example of the category. Rosch found that Dani speakers , when asked for the best exampies of their two color categories , chose focal colors, for example , white, re d, or yellow for mala with different speakers making different choices.
In a remarkable set of experiments, Rosch set out to show that primary color categories were psychologically real for speakers of Dani , even though they were not named. She set out to challenge one of Wharf's hy­ potheses, namely, that language determines one's conceptual system. If Wharf were right on this matter, the Dani's two words for colors would determine two and only two conceptual categories of colors. Rosch rea­ soned that if it was language alone that determined color categorization, then the Dani should have equal difficulty learning new words for colors, no matter whether the color ranges had a primary color at the center or a nonprimary color. She then went about studying how Dani speakers would learn new, made-up color terms. One group was taught arbitrary names for eight focal colors, and another group, arbitrary names for eight nonfocal colors (Rosch 1973) . The names for focal colors were learned more easily. Dani speakers were also found (like English speakers) to be able to remember focal colors better than nonfocal colors (Heider 1972) . In an experiment in which speakers judged color similarity, the Dani were shown to represent colors in memory the same way English speakers do (Heider and Olivier 1972) . Rosch's color research also ex­ tended to children. When three-year-olds were presented with an array of

Rosch 41
color chips , and the experimenter turned her back and said "Show me a color ," the children picked focal colors overwhelmingly over nonfocal colors (Heider 197 1 ) . And when four-year-olds were given a color chip and asked to pick from an assortment of chips the one that matched best , the children did best with focal colors.
Focal colors correspond to what Rosch in her later research called cog­ nitive reference points and prototypes-subcategories or category mem­ bers that have a special cognitive status-that of being a "best example." Rosch showed that a variety of experimental techniques involving learn­ ing, matching , memor y, and judgments of similarity converged on cogni­ tive reference points . And she extended the results from colors to other categories , primarily categories of physical objects. She developed other experimental paradigms for investigating categories of physical objects . In each case , asymmetries (called prototype effects) were found: subjects judged certain members of the categories as being more representative of the category than other members. For example, robins are judged to be more representative of the category BIRD than are chickens , penguins, and ostriches, and desk chairs are judged to be more representative of the category C HAIR than are rocking chairs , barber chairs , beanbag chairs , or electric chairs. The most representative members of a category are called "prototypical" members. Here are some of the experimental paradigms used in studying categories of physical objects. Subjects give consistent goodness-of-example ratings across these experimental paradigms.
Direct rating: SUbjects are asked to rate , say o n a scale from one to
seven, how good an example of a category (e.g. , BIRD) various mem­
bers are (e.g. , a robin, a chicken , etc . ) . Reaction time: Subjects are asked to press a button to indicate true or
false in response to a statement of the form "An [example] is a [category name]" (e.g. , "A chicken is a bird"). Response times are shorter for representative examples. Production of examples: When asked to list or draw examples of cate­ gory members , subjects were more likely to list or draw more repre­ sentative examples. Asymmetry in similarity ratings: Less representative examples are of­ ten considered to be more similar to more representative examples than the converse. Not surprisingly, Americans consider the United States to be a highly representative example of a country. In experi­ ments where subjects were asked to give similarity ratings for pairs of countries , the following asymmetry arose . Subjects considered Mexico to be more similar to the United States than the United States is to Mexico. See Rosch 1975a and Tversky and Gati 1978 .

42 Chapter 2
Asymmetry in generalization: New information about a representative category member is more likelytobe generalized to nonrepresentative members than the reverse. For example, it was shown that subjects be­ lieved that a disease was more likely to spread from robins to ducks on an island , than from ducks to robins. (This result is from Rips 1 975 . )
Family resemblances: Wittgenstein had speculated that categories were structured by what he called "family resemblances." Rosch showed that what philosophers took as a matter for a priori speculation could be demonstrated empirically. Characterizing "family resemblances" as perceived similarities between representative llnd nonrepresenta­ tive members of categories, Rosch showed that there was a correla­ tion between family resemblances and numerical ratings of best ex­ amples derived from the above experiments . (See Rosch and Mer vis 1975 and Rosch , Simpson , and Miller 1976 .)
Such studies have been replicated often by other experimenters. There is no doubt that prototype effects of this sort are real . However, there have been some misunderstandings and debates concerning the interpretation of these results. Some of the debates will be discussed in detail below. But hefore we go on , we ought to clear up some of the common misunder­ st andings .
Rosch's genius has two aspects: she both launched a general challenge to the classical theory and devised , with her co-workers , replicable experiments demonstrating prototype effects, as well as basic-level ef­ fects . These experiments demonstrate the inadequacy of the classical the­ ory; the classical theory cannot account for such results . But prototype effects , in themselves, do not provide any specific alternative theory of mental representation. And, as a responsible experimenter, Rosch has consistently distinguished between what her experimental results show and any theories that might account for those results .
Rosch went through three phases in her thinking about categorization.
- Phase I (late 1960s to early 1970s) : Because she was studying color , shape , and emotions , she assumed prototypes were primarily a matter of (a) perceptual salience, or which things are most readily noticed by people; (b) memorability , or which things are easiest for people to re­ member; and (c) stimulus generalization, or the ability of people to generalize from one thing to something else that is physically similar to it. As she says (Rosch, in press) : "Suppose that there are percep­ tually salient colors which more readily attract attention and are more easily remembered than other colors. When category names are learned, they tend to become attached first to the salient stimuli ; then ,

Rosch 43
by means of the principle of stimulus generalization , they generalize to other, physically similar instances." - Phase II (early to mid 1970s) : Under the influence of information­ processing psychology, Rosch considered the possibility that proto­ type effects , as operationalized by the experiments cited above, might provide a characterization of the internal structure of the category. Thus, for example, the goodness-of-example ratings might directly reflect the internal structure of the category in mental representation . Two natural questions arose: 1 . Do the EFFECTS , defined operationally , characterize the STRUCTURE of the category as it is represented in the mind? 2. Do the PROTOTYPES constitute mental REPRESENTATIONS? Given the assumptions of information-processing psychology, the ex­ perimental data can be interpreted most straightforwardly by answer­ ing yes to both questions. Rosch (1975b) initially interpreted her data in j ust this way. - Phase III (late 1970s) : Rosch eventually gave up on these interpreta­ tions of her experimental results. Such interpretations were artifacts of an overly narrow view of information-processing psychology. She came to the conclusion that prototype effects, defined operationally by experiment , underdetermined mental representations. The effects constrained the possibilities for what representations might be , but there was no one-to-one correspondence between the effects and mental representations. The effects had " sources ," but one could not determine the sources given the effects. As she says of the research in Phase II (Rosch , in press) : "The type of conclusions generated by this approach were , however, very general ; e.g. , that the representation evoked by the category name was more like good examples than poor examples of the category; that it was in a form more general than ei­ ther words or pictures , etc . On the whole other information-processing researchers have considered the concepts of prototypes and typicality functions underspecified and have provided a variety of precise models , mini-models, and distinctions to be tested ."
I t is often the case that positions taken early in one's career tend to be associated with a researcher long after he or she has given up those posi­ tions . Many of those who read Rosch's early works did not read her later works , where she gave up on her early interpretations of the experimental results. Consequently, it is not widely known that Rosch abandoned the ideas that prototype effects directly mirror category structure and that prototypes constitute representations of categories. Because of this,

44 Chapter 2
Rosch has had to provide explicit admonitions against overly simplistic interpretations of prototype effects-interpretations of the sort that she herself made in Phase II of her research . For example , she states :
The pervasiveness of prototypes in real-world categories and of prototypi­ cality as a variable indicates that prototypes must have some place in psycho­ logical theories of representation , processing, and learning. However, proto­ types themselves do not constitute any particular model of processes, representations, or learning. This point is so often misunderstood that it re­ quires discussion :
1 . To speak of a prototype at all is simply a convenient grammatical fiction; what is really referred to are j udgments of degree of prototypicality . · . . For natural-language categories, to speak of a single entity that is the prototype is either a gross misunderstanding of the empirical data or a covert theory of mental representation.
2. Prototypes do not constitute any particular processing model for cate­ gories. . . . What facts about prototypicality do contribute to processing no­ tions is a constraint-processing models should not be inconsistent with the known facts about prototypes . For example , a model should not be such as to predict equal verification times for good and bad examples of categories nor predict completely random search through a category.
3 . Prototypes do n o t constitute a theory of representation for categories. · . . Prototypes can be represented either by propositional or image systems. · . . As with processing models, the facts about prototypes can only con­ strain, but do not determine , models of representation . A representation of categories in terms of conjoined necessary and sufficient attributes alone would pi"obably be incapable of handling all of the presently known facts, but there are many representations other than necessary and sufficient attributes that are possible .
4 . Although prototypes must be learned, they do not constitute any par­ ticular theory of category learning. (Rosch 1978, pp. 40--41 )
Despite Rosch's admonitions to the contrary, and despite her minimal theorizing concerning the sources of prototype effects, her results on pro­ totype effects are still sometimes interpreted as constituting a prima facie theory of representation of category structure, as she thought was possi­ ble during Phase II of her research .
For example, take her results showing prototype effects within the category bird. Her experimental ranking shows that subjects view robins and sparrows as the best examples of birds, with owls and eagles lower down in the rankings and ostriches, emus, and penguins among the worst examples . In the early to mid 1970s , during Phase II of Rosch's research , such empirical goodness-of-example ratings were commonly taken as

Rosch 45
constituting a claim to the effect that membership in the category bird is graded and that owls and penguins are less members of the bird category than robins . (See Lakoff 1972 for a typical example.) It later became clear that that was a mistaken interpretation of the data . Rosch's ratings make no such claim; they are just ratings and do not make any claims at all . They are consistent with the interpretation that the category bird has strict boundaries and that robins, owls , and penguins are all 100 percent members of that category . However, that category must have additional internal structure of some sort that produces these goodness-of-example ratings . Moreover , that internal structure must be part of our concept of what a bird is, since it results in asymmetric inferences of the sort dis­ cussed above, described by Rips (1975).
This point is extremely important . Category structure plays a role in reasoning. In many cases , prototypes act as cognitive reference points of various sorts and form the basis for inferences (Rosch 1 975a , 1981 ) . The study of human inference is part of the study of human reasoning and con­ ceptual structure ; hence, those prototypes used in making inferences must be part of conceptual structure .
It is important to bear in mind th at prototype effects are superficial. The y may result fro m many factors. In the case of a graded category like tall man , which is fuzzy and does not have rigid boundaries, prototype ef­ fects may result from degree of category membership, while in the case of bird, which does have rigid boundaries, the prototype effects must result from some other aspect of internal category structure .
One of the goals of this book is to ou'line a general approach to the the­ ory of categorization and to sketch the range of sources for superficial prototype effects . We will undertake this in chapters 4 through 6, where we discuss cognitive models. Our basic claim will be that prototype effects result from the nature of cognitive models , which can be viewed as "theo­ ries" of some subj ect matter .
One of the most interesting confirmations of this hypothesis has come through the work of B arsalou ( 1983 , 1 984) . B arsalou has studied what he calls " ad hoc categories"--categories that are not conventional or fixed, but rather are made up on the fly for some i mmediate purpose . Such categories must be constructed on the basis of one's cognitive models of the subject matter under consideration . Examples of such categories are things to take from one's home during a fire, what to get for a birthday present, what to do for entertainment on a weekend, etc . Barsalou ob­ serves that such categories have prototype structure-structure that does not exist in advance, since the category is not conventional and does not exist in advance. Barsalou argues that in such cases , the nature of the

46 Chapter 2
category is principally determined by goals and that such goal structure is a function of one's cognitive models . Such a view has also been advocated by Murphy and Medin ( 1984) .

Basic-Level Effects
The classical theory of categories gives no special importance to catego­ ries in the middle of a taxonomic hierarchy . Yet, as Berlin (Berlin , Breed­ love , Raven 1974) and Hunn (1977) have shown for Tzeltal plant and ani­ mal taxonomies, the level of the biological genus is psychologically basic. The genus stands in the middle of the hierarchy that goes from UNIQUE BEGINNER to LIFE FORM to INTERMEDIATE to GENUS to SPECIES to VARIETY. Their results show a discrepancy between the classical theory of categories and a cognitively adequate theory of categories .
Rosch and her associates have extended the study of basic-level effects from cognitive anthropology to the experimental paradigm of cognitive psychology . Like Berlin, they found that the psychologically most basic level was in the middle of the taxonomic hierarchies :

SUPERORDINATE BASIC LEVEL SUBORDINATE

ANIMAL DOG RETRIEVER

FURNITURE CHAIR ROCKER

Just as Hunn (1975) argued that the basic level for animal categories is the only level at which categorization is determined by overall gestalt percep­ tion (without distinctive feature analysis) , so Rosch and others (1976) have found that the basic level is:

- The highest level at which category members have similarly perceived
overall shapes. - The highest level at which a single mental image can reflect the entire
category. - The highest level at which a person uses similar motor actions for
interacting with category members. - The level at which subjects are fastest at identifying category mem-
bers. - The level with the most commonly used labels for category members . - The first level named and understood by children . - The first level to enter the lexicon of a language .
- The level with the shortest primary lexemes. - The level at which terms are used in neutral contexts. For example ,
There's a dog on the porch can be used in a neutral context, whereas special contexts are needed for There's a mammal on the porch or
There's a wire-haired terrier on the porch. (See Cruse 1977 . ) - The level at which most of our knowledge is organized.

Thus basic-level categories are basic in four respects:

Rosch 47

Perception : Overall perceived shape ; single mental image ; fast identi­
fication . Function: General motor program. Com munication: Shortest , most commonly used and contextually neu­
tral words, first learned by children and first to enter the lexicon . Knowledge Organization : Most attributes of category members are
stored at this level .

The fact that knowledge is mainly organized at the basic level is deter­ mined in the following way : When subjects are asked to list attributes of categories, they list very few attributes of category members at the super­ ordinate level (furniture , vehicle, mammal) ; they list most of what they know at the basic level (chair, car , dog) ; and at the subordinate level (rocking chair, sports car, retriever) there is virtually no increase in knowledge over the basic level.
Why should most information be organized at a single conceptual level and why should it be this level in particular? To me, the most convincing
hypothesis to date comes from the research of Tversky and Hemenway ( 1 984) . Berlin (Berlin, B reed love, Raven 1 974) and Hunn ( 1 977) had suggested that gestalt perception-perception of overall part-whole con­ figuration-is the fundamental determinant of the basic level. The experi­ mental evidence accumulated by Tversky and Hemenway supports the Berlin-Hunn hypothesis. Their basic observation is that the basic level is distinguished from other levels on the basis of the type of attributes peo­ ple associate with a category at that level, in particular , attributes con­ cerned with parts. Our knowledge at the basic level is mainly organized around part-whole divisions. The reason is that the way an object is di­ vided into parts determines many things . First, parts are usually corre­ lated with functions, and hence our knowledge about functions is usually associated with knowledge about parts. Second , parts determine shape , and hence the way that an object will be perceived and imaged. Third, we usually interact with things via their parts, and hence part-whole divisions play a major role in determining what motor programs we can use to interact with an object . Thus, a handle is not just long and thin, but it can be grasped by the human hand. As Tversky and Hemenway say , "We sit on the seat of a chair and lean against the back , we remove the peel of a
banana and eat the pulp. " Tversky and Hemenway also suggest that we impose part-whole struc­
ture on events and that our knowledge of event categories is structured ver y much the way our knowledge of physical object categories is . Their suggestion is in the same spirit as Lakoff and Johnson ( 1 980) , where it is

48 Chapter 2
suggested that event categories and other abstract categories are struc­ tured metaphorically on the basis of structures from the realm of physical experience .
Acquisition
One of the most striking results about basic-level categorization concerns the acquisition of concepts by children. If the classical theory of categori­ zation were correct , then there should be no more to categorization than what one finds in the logic of classes: hierarchical categorization based on shared properties of the members of the categories. Before the work of Rosch and Mervis (Rosch et al. 1976) , research on child development had not been informed by the idea of basic-level categorization. It had been concluded that, for example, three-year-old children had not mas­ tered categorization, which was taken to be taxonomic categorization defined by the logic of classes. This conclusion was based on the perform­ ance of children in "sorting tasks," where subjects are asked to "put to­ gether the things that go together." Rosch and her associates observed that such studies tended to involve categorization at the superordinate level.
The stimuli used in sorting tasks have tended to be of two types: If abstract (e . g . , geo:netric forms varying in dimensions such as form, color, and size), they are typically presented in a set which has no structure (e . g . , each attribute occurs with all combinations of all others) ; if representational (e. g . , toy versions o r pictures of real-world objects), the arrays are such that they can be grouped taxonomically only at the superordinate level. Thus, the representational stimuli used in sorting tasks are such that if the child were to sort the objects into those of like taxonomic category , he would have to put together such items as socks and shirt, dog and cow . Children do not seem to have been asked to sort together objects belonging to the same basic level category (e.g. , several shoes or several dogs) . We suspect this results from the fact that basic objects are so obviously the "same object" to adults that a task does not seem to be a problem of categorization to an adult experimenter unless objects are taken from different basic level categories . (Rosch et al . 1976, pp. 414-15)
Rosch and Mervis then compared sorting tasks for basic-level and super­ ordinate categories . Basic-level sorting required being able to put to­ gether pictures of two different kinds of cows (compared to an airplane, say) or two different kinds of cars (compared to, say, a dog) . Superordi­ nate sorting required , for example, being able to put together a cow and a dog (compared to an airplane) , or a motorcycle and an airplane (com­ pared to a cow) . At all age levels , from three years old up, subjects were

Rosch 49
virtually perfect on basic-level sorting . But, as had been well-known, the three-year-olds had trouble with superordinate sorting. They were only 55 percent correct , while the four-year-olds were 96 percent correct .
It is not true that three-year-olds have not mastered categorization. They have mastered basic-level categorization perfectly. It is superordi­ nate categorization that is not mastered till later. The ability to categorize at the basic level comes first ; the general logic of classes is learned later. Learning to categorize is thus something rather different from learning to use the logic of classes. Therefore, categorization itself is not merely the use of classical taxonomies.
It is important to bear these results in mind throughout the remainder of the book . The reason is this: It is sometimes claimed that basic-level categorization is merely classical taxonomic classification with additional constraints on cognitive processing added (e.g. , perceptual and motor constraints) . The Rosch-Mervis acquisition results show that this is not the case. Basic-level categories develop prior to classical taxonomic cate­ gories. They therefore cannot be the result of classical taxonomic catego­ ries plus something of a sensory-motor nature . Basic-level categories have an integrity of their own. They are our earliest and most natural form of categorization. Classical taxonomic categories are later " achieve­ ments of the imagination ," in Roger Brown's words .
As Rosch and her co-workers Gbserve , basic-level distinctions are "the generally most useful distinctions to make in the world ," since they ar� characterized by overall shape and motor interaction and are at the most general level at which one can form a mental image . Basic-level categori­ zation is mastered by the age of three . But what about children at earlier ages? It is known , for example , that two-year-olds have different catego­ ries from adults . Lions and tigers as well as cats are commonly called "kitty" by two-year-olds . Round candles and banks are commonly called "ball." And some things that we call "chair" may not be chairs for two­ year-olds, e . g . , beanbag chairs. The categories of two-year-olds may be broader than adult categories, or narrower, or overlapping. Does this mean that two-year-olds have not mastered the ability to form basic-level categories?
Not at all . Mervis (1984) has shown that although two-year-olds may have different categories than adults have, those categories are deter­ mined by the same principles that determine adult basic-level catego­ ries . In short , two-year-olds have mastered basic-level categorization , but have come up with different categories than adults-for very good reasons.
The difference is determined by three factors :

50 Chapter 2
1 . The child may not know about culturally significant attributes. Thus , not knowing that a bank is used for storing money , the child may attend to its round shape and cl assify it as a ball.
2 . The salience of particular attributes may be different for a child than for an adult. Thus, a child may know that a bank is for storing money, but may attend to its round shape more than to the slot and keyhole , and still call it a ball . Or the child may attend to both and classify it as both a bank and a ball.
3 . The child may include false attributes in the decision process. Thus , if the child thinks a leopard says "meow," he or she may classify leopards as kitties. The point is that the level of categorization is not independent of who is doing the categorizing and on what basis . Though the same principles may determine the basic level, the circumstances under which those prin­ ciples are employed determine what system of categories results .
Clusters of Interactional Properties
What determines basic-level structure is a matter of correlations: the overall perceived part-whole structure of an object correlates with our motor interaction with that object and with the functions of the parts (and our knowledge of those functions) . It is important to realize that these are not purely objective and "in the world" ; rather they have to do with the world as we interact with it: as we perceive it , image it, affect it with our bodies, and gain knowledge about it.
Thir; is, again, a matter which has often been misunderstood, and Rosch has written at length on the nature of the misunderstanding . "It should be emphasized that we are talking about a perceived world and not a metaphysical world without a knower" (Rosch 1978 , p. 29). She contin­ ues :
When research on basic objects and their prototypes was initially con­ ceived (Rosch et al. 1976), I thought of such attributes as inherent in the real world. Thus , given an organism that had sensory equipment capable of per­ ceiving attributes such as wings and feathers , it was a fact in the real world that wings and feathers co-occurred. The state of knowledge of a person might be ignorant of (or indifferent or inattentive to) the attributes or might know the attributes but be ignorant concerning their correlation . Conversely, a person might know of the attributes and their correlational structure but exaggerate that structure , turning partial into complete correlations (as when attributes true of only many members of a category are thought of as true of all members). However, the environment was thought to constrain categorizations in that human knowledge could not provide correlational structure where there was none at all. For purposes of the basic object

Rosch 5 1
experiments, perceived attributes were operationally defined as those attri­ butes listed by our subjects. Shape was defined as measured by our computer programs. We thus seemed to have our system grounded comfortably in the
real world . On contemplation of the nature of many of our attributes listed by our
subjects, however, it appeared that three types of attributes presented a problem for such a realistic view: (1 ) some attributes, such as "seat" for the object "chair," appeared to have names that showed them not to be mean­
ingful prior to the knowledge of the object as chair; (2) some attributes such as "large" fer the object "piano" seemed to have meaning only in relation to categorization of the object in terms of a superordinate category-piano is large for furniture but small for other kinds of objects such as buildings ; (3)
some attributes such as "you eat on it" for the object "table" were functional
attributes that seemed to require knowledge about humans, their activities, and the real world in order to be understood. That is , it appeared that the analysis of objects into attributes was a rather sophisticated activity that our subjects (and indeed a system of cultural knowledge) might be considered to be able to impose only after the development of a system of categories. (Rosch 1978, pp. 41-42)
Thus the relevant notion of a "property" is not something objectively in the world independent of any being; it is rather what we will refer to as an interactional property-the result of our interactions as part of our physi­ cal and cultural environments given our bodies and our cognitive appara­ tus . Such interactional properties form clusters in our experience , and prototype and basic-level structure can reflect such clusterings.
As Berlin has obser ved , interactional properties and the categories they determine seem objective in the case of properties of basic-level categories�ategories like chair, elephant, and water. The reason is that , given our bodies , we perceive certain aspects of our external envi­ ronment very accurately at the basic level, though not so accurately at other levels . As long as we are talking about properties of basic-level ob­ jects , interactional properties will seem objective .
Perhaps the best way of thinking about basic-level categories is that they are "human-sized." They depend not on objects themselves, inde­ pendent of people, but on the way people interact with objects: the way they perceive them , image them , organize information about them, and behave toward them with their bodies. The relevant properties clustering together to define such categories are not inherent to the objects , but are interactional properties , having to do with the way people interact with objects .
B asic-level categories thus have different properties than superordi­ nate categories . For example , superordinate categories seem not to be characterized by images or motor actions . For example , we have mental

52 Chapter 2
images of chairs-abstract images that don't fit any particular chair-and we have general motor actions for sitting in chairs . But if we go from the basic-l evel categoryCHAIR to thesuperordinate categor y FURNITURE, a differ­ ence emerges. We have no abstract mental images of furniture that are not images of basic-level objects like chairs, tables, beds, etc. Try to imagine a piece of furniture that doesn't look like a chair, or table, or bed , etc. , but i s more abstract . People seem not to b e able t o do so. Moreover, we do not have motor actions for interacting with furniture in general that are not motor actions for interacting with some basic-level object­ chairs , tables, beds, etc. B ut superordinate categories do have other hu­ man-based attributes-like purposes and functions.
In addition , the complements of basic-level categories are not basic level . They do not have the kinds of properties that basic-level categories have. For example, consider nonchairs, that is, those things that are not chairs . What do they look like? Do you have a mental image of a general or an abstract nonchair? People seem not to. How do you interact with a nonchair? Is there some general motor action one performs with non­ chairs? Apparently not. What is a nonchair used for? Do nonchairs have general functions? Apparently not.
In the classical theory, the complement of a set that is defined by neces­ sary and sufficient conditions is another set that is defined by necessary and sufficient conditions. B ut the complement of a basic-level category is not itself a basic-level category.
Cue Validity
One of the ideas that Rosch has regularly stressed is that categories occur in systems, aTld such systems include contrasting categories . Categoriza­ tion depends to a large extent on the nature of the system in which a cate­ gory is embedded . For example, within the superordinate category of things-to-sit-on, chair contrasts with stool, sofa, bench , etc. Chair would no doubt cover a very different range if one of the contrasting categories , say , stool or sofa , were not present .
Rosch has made use of contrasting categories in trying to give a theory of basic-level categorization . At the basic level , Rosch has claimed, cate­ gories are maximally distinct-that is , they maximize perceived similarity among category members and minimize perceived similarities across con­ trasting categories. Rosch and others (1976) attempted to capture this in­ tuition by means of a quantitative measure of what they called category cue validity.
Cue validity is the conditional probability that an obj ect is in a particular category given its possession of some feature (or "cue") . The best cues are those that work all of the time for categories at a given level. For ex-

Rosch 53
ample, if you see a living thing with gills , you can be certain it is a fish. Gills thus has a cue validity o f 1 . 0 for the category fish , and a cue validity of a for other categories. Rosch and her associates suggested that one could extend this definition of cue validity to characterize basic-level cate­ gories . They defined category cue validity as the sum of all the individual cue validities of the features associated with a category.
The highest cue validities in a taxonomic hierarchy , they reasoned , should occur at the basic level. For example , subordinate categories like kitchen chair should have a low category cue validity because most of the attributes of kitchen chairs would be shared with other kinds of chairs and only a few attributes would differentiate kitchen chairs from other chairs . The individual attributes shared across categories would have low cue va­ lidities for the kitchen chair category; thus , seeing a chair with a back doesn't give you much reason for thinking it's a kitchen chair rather than some other kind of chair. Since most of the individual cue validities for at­ tributes would be low, the sum should be low.
Correspondingly, they reasoned that category cue validity would be low for superordinate categories like furniture , since they would have few or no common attributes. Since basic-level categories have many proper­ ties in common among their members and few across categories , their category cue validities should be highest.
This idea was put forth during the earlier phase of Rosch's career when she still believed that the relevant attributes for characterizing basic-level categories were objectively existing attributes "in the world ." Murphy ( 1 982) has shown, however, that if category cue validity is defined for ob­ jectively existing attributes , then that measure cannot pick out basic-level categories. Murphy observes that individual cue validities for a superor­ dinate category are always greater than or equal to those for a basic-level category; the same must be true for their sums. For example,
(a) If people know that some trucks [basic-level] have air brakes, they know that having air brakes is a possible cue for being a vehicle [superor­ dinate] . (b) People know that some animals [superordinate] have beaks, but that fish [basic-level] do not (thereby giving animal a valid cue that the basic category does not have). (Murphy 1982, p. 176)
Murphy observes that his objection could be gotten around under the as­ sumption that most attributes are not directly linked to superordinate categories in memory. This would be true , for example , given Tversky and Hemenway's characterization of the basic level as that level at which most knowledge is organized. But this would require a psychological definition of attribute (equivalent to our interactional properties) , not a

54 Chapter 2
notion of attributes as existing objectively in the external world . But such a notion would presuppose a prior characterization of basic-level cate­ gory-that level at which most knowledge is organized. Category cue va­ lidity defined for such psychological (or interactional) attributes might correlate with basic-level categorization , but it would not pick out basic­ level categories ; they would already have to have been picked out in or­ der to apply the definition of category cue validity so that there was such a correlation. Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that basic-level categories are , in fact , most differentiated in people's minds; but they are most differentiated because of their other properties, especially because most knowledge is organized at that level.
Clustering and Causation
Two of the themes that emerge from the research just discussed are the clustering of properties and the nonobjective , or interactional , character of properties relevant to human categorization. One of the most interest­ ing of human categories from a philosophical point of view is the category of causes . Causation is represented in the grammar of most languages­ and usually not just one kind of causation, but a variety of kinds. I have suggested elsewhere (Lakoff 1977) that the category of kinds of causation shows prototype effects in the ways that they are represented in natural languages. These effects are relatively uniform across languages.
We can account for these effects if we assume that prototypical causa­ tion is understood in terms of a cluster of interactional properties. This hypothesis appears to account best for the relation between language and conceptual structure , as well as for the relationships among the varieties of causation. The cluster seems to define a prototypical causation , and nonprototypical varieties of causation seem to be best characterizable in terms of deviations from that cluster.
Prototypical causation appears to be direct manipulation, which is characterized most typically by the following cluster of interactional properties:
1 . There is an agent that does something . 2. There is a patient that undergoes a change to a new state . 3 . Properties 1 and 2 ccnstitute a single event; they overlap in time
and space ; the agent comes in contact with the patient . 4. Part of what the agent does (either the motion or the exercise of
will) precedes the change in the patient . 5 . The agent is the energy source ; the patient is the energy goal ;
there is a transfer of energy from agent to patient. 6. There is a single definite agent and a single definite patient .

Rosch 55
7. The agent is human. 8 . a. The agent wills his action.
b. The agent is in control of his action. c. The agent bears primary responsibility for both his action and
the change. 9 . The agent uses his hands, body, or some instrument. 10. The agent is looking at the patient, the change in the patient is
perceptible, and the agent perceives the change . The most representative examples of humanly relevant causation have all ten of these properties . This is the case in the most typical kinds of exam­ ples in the linguistics literature: Max broke the window, Brutus killed Caesar, etc. B illiard-ball causation, of the kind most discussed in the natural sciences, has properties 1 through 6. Indirect causation is not pro­ totypical, since it fails in number 3 , and possibly other conditions . According to this account, indirect causes are less representative exam­ ples of causation than direct causes. Multiple causes are less representa­ tive than single causes. Involuntary causation is less representative than voluntary causation. Many languages of the world meet the following generalization: The more direct the causation, the closer the morphemes expressi ng the cause and the result. This accounts for the distinction be­ tween kill and cause to die. Kill expresses direct causation, with cause and result expressed in a single morpheme-the closest possible connection . When would anyone ever say "cause to die"? In general, when there is no direct causation , when there is causation at a distance or accidental causa­ tion. Hinton ( 1982) gives a similar case from Mixtec, an Otomanguean language of Mexico. Mi xt{ c has three causative morphemes: the word S{Pa , and the prefi xes sa- and S-. The longest of these corre sponds to the most indirect causation, and the shortest to the most direct causation . An explanation of this fact about the linguistic expression of kinds of causa­ tion is provided by Lakoff and Johnson (1980, chap . 20) .
What is particularly interesting about this state of affairs is that the best example of the conceptual category of causation is typically marked by a grammatical construction or a morpheme and that the word cause is re­ served for noncentral members of the conceptual category. There is a good reason for this . The concept of causation-prototypical causation -is one of the most fundamental of human concepts. It is a concept that people around the world use in thought. It is used spontaneously, auto­ matically, effortlessly , and often. Such concepts are usually coded right into the grammar of languages�ither via grammatical constructions or grammatical morphemes. For this reason, the prototypical concept of causation is built into the grammar of the language , and the word cause is relegated to characterizing noncentral causation .

Summary
The basic results of prototype theory leading up to the cognitive models approach can be summarized as follows:
- Some categories, like tall man or red, are graded; that is, they have in­ herent degrees of membership, fuzzy boundaries , and central mem­ bers whose degree of membership (on a scale from zero to one) is one.
- Other categories, like bird, have clear boundaries; but within those boundaries there are graded prototype effects-some category mem­ bers are better examples of the category than others.
- Categories are not organized just in terms of simple taxonomic hierar­ chies. Instead, categories "in the middle" of a hierarchy are the most basic, relative to a variety of psychological criteria: gestalt percep­ tion , the ability to form a mental image , motor interactions, and ease of learning, remembering, and use . Most knowledge is organized at this level.
- The basic level depends upon perceived part-whole structure and cor­ responding knowledge about how the parts function relative to the whole.
- Categories are organized into systems with contrasting elements. - Human categories are not objectively "in the world ," external to hu-
man beings. At least some categories are embodied. Color catego­ ries, for example , are determined jointly by the external physical world , human biology , the human mind , plus cultural considerations. Basic-level structure depends on human perception, imaging capac­ ity, motor capabilities, etc. - The properties relevant to the description of categories are interac­ tional properties , properties characterizable only in terms of the inter­ action of human beings as part of their environment. Prototypical members of categories are sometimes describable in terms of clusters of such interactional properties. These clusters act as gestalts : the cluster as a whole is psychologically simpler than its parts.
- Prototype effects, that is, asymmetries among category members such as goodness-of-example judgments , are superficial phenomena which may have many sources.
The cognitive models approach to categorization is an attempt to make sense of all these observations. It is motivated by
- a need to understand what kinds of prototype effects there are and what their sources are

Summary 57
- a need to account for categorization not merely for physical objects but in abstract conceptual domains�motions , spatial relations, so­ cial relationships, language, etc.
- a need for empirical study of the nature of cognitive models - a need for appropriate theoretical and philosophical underpinnings
for prototype theory.
These needs will be addressed below . But before we begin, it is important to see that prototype effects occur not only in nonlinguistic conceptual structure , but in linguistic structure as well. The reason is that linguistic structure makes use of general cognitive apparatus , such as category structure. Linguistic categories are kinds of cognitive categories.

3 CHAPTE R
Prototype Effects in Language
One of the principal claims of this book is that language makes use of our general cognitive apparatus . If this claim is correct, two things follow:
- Linguistic categories should be of the same type as other categories in our conceptual system . In particular, they should show prototype and basic-level effects .
- Evidence about the nature of linguistic categories should contribute to a general understanding of cognitive categories in general. Because language has such a rich category structure and because linguistic evidence is so abundant, the study of linguistic categorization should be one of the prime sources of evidence for the nature of category structure in general.
Thus , we need to ask the general question: What evidence is there that language shows prototype and basic-level effects?
The issue is a profound one , because it is by no means obvious that the language makes use of our general cognitive apparatus. In fact, the most widely accepted views of language within both linguistics and the philoso­ phy of language make the opposite assumption: that language is a sepa­ rate "modular" system independent of the rest of cognition . The indepen­ dence of grammar from the rest of cognition is perhaps the most fundamental assumption on which Noam Chomsky's theory of language rests . As we shall see in chapter 14, the very idea that language is a "for­ mal system" (in the technical mathematical sense used by Chomsky and many other linguistic theorists) requires the assumption that language is independent of the r(:st of cognition. That formal-system view also embodies the implicit assumption that categories are classical (and hence can be characterized by distinctive features) . Such views are also the norm in the philosophy of language , especially in the work of Richard Montague, Donald Davidson , David Lewis, Saul Kripke , and many othe rs . 58

Prototype Effects in Linguistic Categories 59
Thus , the question of what linguistic categories are like is important in two ways.
First , it affects our understanding of what language is. Does language make use of general cognitive mechanisms? Or is it something separate and independent, using only mechanisms of its own? How this question is answered will determine the course of the future study of language. Entirely different questions will be asked and theories proposed de­ pending on the answer.
Second , the answer will affect the study of cognition, since it will deter­ mine whether linguistic evidence is admissible in the study of the mind in general.
It is for these reasons that it is important to look closely at studies that have revealed the existence of prototype effects in language.
There are actually two bodies of relevant studies. One is a body of re­ search based on Phases I and II of Rosch's research on prototype theor y. It i s concerned with demonstrating the existence of prototype effects in language . The second body of research focuses on the cognitive model in­ terpretation of prototype effects that we will be discussing below. The present chapter is a survey of the first body of results , which show little more than the existence of prototype effects in language. Chapters 4 through 8 and the three case studies at the end of the book will survey the second body of results , which focus more on the nature of the effects .
Prototype Effects in Linguistic Categories
The study of prototype effects has a long tradition in linguistics. The kinds of effects that have been studied the most are asymmetries within categories and gradations away from a best example .
Markedness
The study of certain types of asymmetries within categories is known within linguistics as the study of markedness. The term markedness arises from the fact that some morphological categories have a "mark" and others are "unmarked." Take the category of number in English . Plural number has a "mark," the morpheme -s , as in boys , while singular num­ ber lacks any overt "mark ," as in boy. The singular is thus the unmarked m ember of the morphological category number in English. Thus , singular and plural-the two members of the number category-show an asymme­ tr y ; they are not treated the same in English, since singular has no overt mark. The intuition that goes along with this is that singular is, somehow, cognitively simpler than plural and that its cognitive simplicity is reflected

60 Chapter 3
in its shorter form . The idea here is that simplicity in cognition is reflected in simplicity of form . Zero-marking for a morpheme is one kind of
simplicity . In phonology , markedness is often understood in terms of some notion
of relative ease of articulation. For example, the consonants p, t, and k are voiceless, that is, they do not involve the vibration of the vocal chords , while the minimally contrasting voiced consonants h, d, and g do involve vocal cord vibration. Thus, one can understand voicing as a " mark" added to voiceless consonants to yield voiced consonants , except between vowels where the vocal cords are vibrating to produce the vowels . In that situation, the voiced consonants are unmarked and the voiceless consonants are marked. Thus, there is an asymmetry in terms of �elative ease of articulation. Voiced and voiceless consonants also show an asymmetry in the way they pattern in the sound systems of languages . For example, many languages do not have both voiced and voiceless con­ sonants. If voicing and voicelessness were symmetric, one might expect an equal number of languages to have only voiceless or only voiced consonants. But in such a situation , the norm is for such a language to have voiceless consonants. Similarly, within a language, there are envi­ ronments where it is impossible to have both voiced and voiceless con­ sonants. For example , in English , after initial S- , there is no contrast between voiced and voiceless consonants. Only voiceless consonants may occur. English has words like spot, but no contrasting words like shot. Similarly, at the end of words in German, there is no contrast between voiced and voiceless stop consonants. Only the voiceless consonants can occur. Thus, for example, /d/ is pronounced as [t] . In general, where the contrast is neutralized (that is, only one member of the pair can occur) , the one which occurs is "unmarked" in that environment.
Neutralization of contrasts can also occur in semantics. Consider con­ trasts like tall-short, happy-sad, etc. These pairs are not completely symmetric. For example, if one asks How tall is Harry? one is not suggest­ ing that Harry is tall, but if one asks How short is Harry? one is suggesting that Harry is short . Only one member of the pair tall-short can be used with a neutral meaning, namely, tall. Since it occurs in cases where the contrast is neutralized , tall is referred to as the " unmarked" member of the tall-short contrast set . Correspondingly , it is assumed that tallness is cognitively more basic than shortness and the word marking the cogni­ tively basic dimension occurs in neutral contexts .
In general, markedness is a term used by linguists to describe a kind of prototype effect-an asymmetry in a category, where one member or subcategory is taken to be somehow more basic than the other (or

Prototype Effects in Linguistic Categories 61
others) . Correspondingly, the unmarked member is the default value­ the member of the category that occurs when only one member of the category can occur and all other things are equal .
Other Prototype Effects
Prototype effects have shown up in all areas of language-phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics . In all cases , they are inconsistent with the classical theory of categories and are in conflict with current or­ thodoxies in the field which assume the correctness of the classical theory. Here is a sampling of studies which have shown prototype effects .
Phonology
There is no more fundamental distinction in linguistics than the distinc­ tion between a phone and a phoneme. A phone is a unit of speech sound , while a phoneme is a cognitive element understood as occurring "at a higher level" and usually represented by a phone. For example, English has a phoneme I k l (sometimes spelled with the letter c in English orthog­ raphy) which occurs in the words cool, keel, key, school, andflak. If atten­ tion is payed to details of pronunciation, it turns out that I k l is pro­ nounced differently in these words: aspirated velar [kh] in cool, aspirated palatel [k'h] in keel, unaspirated velar [k] in school, and unaspirated palatal [k'] in ski. English speakers perceive these, despite their differences in pronunciation , as being instances of the same phc­ neme I k / . However, there are other languages in which [kh] and [k] are instances of different phonemes , and others still in which [k ' ] and [k] are instances of different phonemes .
Jeri Jaeger (1 980) has replicated Rosch's experiments in the domain of phonology. She suggests , on the basis of experimental evidence , that phonemes are prototype-based categories of phones . Thus , the phoneme I k l in English is the category consisting of the phones [k] , [kh] , [k ' J , and [k 'h] with [k] as the prototypical member. Phonemic categories in general are understood in terms of their prototypical members. The non­ prototypical phones are related to the prototype by phonological rules . Jaeger's results, if correct, indicate that phonological categorization , like other cognitive categorization, shows prototype effects . Her results con­ tradict most contemporary phonological theories, which take the classical theory of categorization for granted. They point in the direction of a uni­ fication of phonology and other aspects of cognition .
Jaeger's other experimental results show:
- In English, the [k] after word-initial [s] is part of the I k l phoneme and not either the /g l phoneme or some velar archiphoneme.

62 Chapter 3
- In English , the affricates [15] and [dz] are unitary phonemes from a cognitive point of view.
- English speakers consider the following vowel pairs to belong to­ gether in a psychologically unified set: [ey-ae] , [i-E.] , [ow-a] , [u-A] . The source of the speaker's knowledge about this set of alter­ nations is the orthographic system of English.
- Phonetic features in general have psychological reality, but not all the features proposed in various theories do. [Continuant] , [sono­ rant] , and [voice] are confirmed as real by the experiments , but [anterior] is brought into question .
- Phonetic features are not binary , but consist of a dimension along which segments can have varying values.
- A psychologically real theory must allow for the possibility of more than one correct feature assignment for a segment.
The application of Rosch's experimental techniques to phonology is a real innovation that requires a thorough reevaluation of phonological theor y.
Morphology
Bybee and Moder (1983) have shown that English strong verbs like string/strung form a morphological category that displays prototype effects . They argue that verbs that form their P1st tense with A (spelled u in English orthography) form a prototype-based category. The verbs in­ clude: spin, win, cling, fling, sling, sting, string, swing, wring, hang, stick, strike, slink, stick, sneak, dig, and some others that have recently devel­ oped similar past tense forms in certain dialects , e .g . , bring, shake. On the basis of experimental results, they argue that the category has a prototype with the following properties :
It begins with s followed by one or two consonants: sC(C)-. It ends with the velar nasal: /fJ/. It has a lax high front vowel: [.
Although the vcrbs in the category cannot be defined by common fea­ tures , they all bear family rescmblances to this prototype. String, sling, swing, and sting fit it exactly. The following have what Bybee and Moder analyze as "one" difference from the prototype: cling, fling, and bring have two initial consonants , but no s; spin and stick have the right initial consonant cluster and vowel, but differ from the final consonant by one phonological property each-spin has a dental instead of a velar nasal and stick has a velar stop instead of a velar nasal. Win has two minimal differ­ ences : no initial s and a final dental nasal instead of a velar. Strike also has twO differences : a nonnasal final COnsonant and a different vowel .

Prototype Effects in Linguistic Categories 63
This category can be categorized by a central member plus something else. In this case the "something else" is a characterization of "minimal" phonological differences : the lack of an initial s, the lack of nasalization, a different vowel , the difference between a velar and a dental consonant , etc . Bybee and Moder have investigated this case only and do not claim that these "minimal" differences will always count as minimal, either in English or in all languages. Without a theory of what counts as a minimal difference for morphological categorization , Bybee and Moder simply have a list of relevant differences that hold in this case. It would be inter­ esting to see if a more general theory could be developed.
Syntax
In a number of studies ranging widely over English syntax , John Robert Ross (1972, 1973a, b , 1974 , 1981) has shown that just about every syntac­ tic category in the language shows prototype effects . These include categories like noun, verb , adj ective , clause, preposition, noun phrase , verb phrase, etc. Ross has also demonstrated that syntactic construc­ tions in English show prototype effects, for example, passive , relative WH-preposing, question WH-preposing, topicalization , conjunction , etc.
Let us consider one of Ross's examples: nouns . Ross's basic insight is that normal nouns undergo a large range of grammatical processes in English , while less nouny nouns do not undergo the full range of pro­ cesses that apply to nouns in general. Moreover, even nouns that, in most constructions , are excellent examples of nouns may be less good exam­ ples in special constructions. Consider the nouns toe, breath, way , and time, as they occur in the expressions:
to stub one's toe to hold one's breath to lose one's way to take one's time
These all look superficially as if they have the same structure. But, as Ross demonstrates , within these expressions toe is nounier than breath , which is nounier than way, which is nounier than time. Ross (1981) gives three syntactic environments that demonstrate the hierarchy. Starred sentences indicate ill-formedness.
I. Modification by a passive participle A stubbed toe can be very painful. * Held breath is usually fetid when released . *A lost way has been the cause of many a missed appointment . * Taken time might tend to irritate your boss .

64 Chapter 3
II. Gapping I stubbed my toe, and she hers. I held my breath, and she hers . *1 lost my way , and she hers. *1 took my time, and she hers.
III. Pluralization Betty and Sue stubbed their toes. *Betty and Sue stubbed their toe.
Betty and Sue held their breaths. Betty and Sue held their breath.
*Betty and Sue lost their ways. Betty and Sue lost their way.
*Betty and Sue took their times. Betty and Sue took their time.
Ross's tests do not differentiate way and time. Here is a further test envi­ ronment that confirms Ross's judgment:
IV. Pronominalization I stubbed my toe , but didn't hurt it. Sam held his breath for a few seconds and then released it. Harry lost his way , but found it again . * Harry took his time, but wasted it.
In each of these cases, the nounier nouns follow the general rule (that is , they behave the way one would expect nouns to behave) , while the less nouny nouns do not follow the rule. As the sentences indicate , there is a hierarchy of nouniness among the examples given. Rules differ as to how nouny a noun they require . As Ross has repeatedly demonstrated, exam­ ples like these are rampant in English syntax.
More recently, Hopper and Thompson ( 1984) have proposed that the prototypical members of the syntactic categories noun and verb can be defined in terms of semantic and discourse functions . They provide an ac­ count with examples from a wide range of languages that indicate that nouns and verbs have prototypical functions in discourses.
Subject , Agent , and Topic
B ates and MacWhinney (1982) proposed on the basis of language acquisi­ tion data that prototype theory can be used to characterize the grammati­ cal relation SUBJECT in the following way :
- A prototypical SUBJECT is both AGENT and TOPIC.

Subject, Agent, and Topic 65
Van Oosten ( 1984) has found a wide range of evidence in English substan­ tiating this hypothesis and expanding it to include the following:
- AGENT and TOPIC are both natural categories centering around proto­ types.
- Membership in the category SUBJECT cannot be completely predicted from the properties of agents and topics .
As usual in prototype-based categories, things that are very close to pro­ totypical members will most likely be in the category and be relatively good examples. And as expected, the boundary areas will differ from lan­ guage to language. Category membership will be motivated by (though not predicted from) family resemblances to prototypical members.
- Noun phrases that are neither prototypical agents nor prototypical topics can be subjects-and relatively good examples of subjects­ providing that they have important agent and topic properties.
- This permits what we might call a "prototype-based universal." SUB­ JECT IS A CATEGORY WHOSE CENTRAL MEMBERS ARE BOTH PROTOTYPICAL AGENTS AND PROTOTYPICAL TOPICS.
This characterization of subject is semantically based , but not in the usual sense ; that is, it does not attempt to predict all subjects from semantic and pragmatic properties. But it does define the prototype of the category in semantic and pragmatic terms. Noncentral cases will differ according to language-particular conventions. The subject category is thus what we will refer to in chapter 6 as a radial category. In lhis case , the center, or prototype , of the category is predictable. And while the noncentral mem­ bers are not predictable from the central member, they are "motivated" by it, in the sense that they bear family resemblances to it. Motivation in this sense will be discussed in great detail below.
Perhaps the most striking confirmation of the Bates-MacWhinney hy­ pothesis comes from Van Oosten's study of the uses of the passive in En­ glish. Van Oosten picked out passive sentences as they occurred in tran­ scribed conversation and compiled a list of all the uses. The list seemed random. She then compared her list of uses of the passive with her list of the properties of prototypical agents and topics. What she noticed was a remarkable correlation. According to the Bates-MacWhinney hypothe­ sis, the subjects of simple active sentences should be capable of displaying all the properties of agents and topics . We can view this as a conj unction of the following form , where each Pi is either an agent property or a topic property :

66 Chapter 3
Passive sentences are used for various reasons-whenever no single noun phrase has all the agent and topic properties. Thus, passives (on the Bates­ MacWhinney hypothesis) should occur when the subject of the passive sentence fails to have one of the prototypical agent or topic properties . Thus, the uses of the passive should be a disjunction of the form :
not PI or not P2 or . . . or not Pt! .
This was in fact just the list of uses of the passive that Van Oosten had compiled in her empirical study !
For example, among the agent properties are volition (call it PI ) and primary responsibility for the action (call it P2) . Correspondingly , pas­ sives can be used to indicate that an action was accidental (not PI) or to avoid placing responsibility on the person performing the action (not P2). Similarly , one of the topic properties of a prototypical simple active sen­ tence is that the actor is already under discussion in the discourse (call this P3) . Correspondingly , a passive may be used to introduce (not P3) the ac­ tor into the discourse , by placing the actor in the by-phrase . In this way , prototype theory enables Van Oosten to explain why the passive is used as it is. Van Oosten's analysis also provides evidence that supports the conception of subject as a category whose prototypical subcategory is predictable from semantic and pragmatic considerations.
Basic Clause Types
Just about all of the considerable number of contemporary theories of grammar recognize an asymmetry among types of clauses in a given lan­ guage . In certain clauses , there is a "natural" or "direct" relationship be­ tween the meaning of the clause and the grammar of the clause. In En­ glish, for example , simple active declarative sentences-Sam ate a peach, Max is in the kitchen, Harry drives a sports car, Thatfact is odd, etc.-are usually taken as examples of that natural (or direct) relationship. Other kinds of clause types are usually considered as deviations from the basic clause type. Here is a handful of standard examples of such "deviations":
Passive: The peach was eaten by Sam. Existential There-sentences: There is a man in the kitchen . Patient subject sentences: This car drives easily . Extrapositions: It is odd that Maxine eats pears. WH-questions: What did Sam eat?
Different theories of grammar treat such basic clause types by different theoretical means. Harris (1957) hypothesized "kernel sentences." Chomsky ( 1 965) hypothesized "deep structures." And virtually every theory of grammar since then has made some such distinction. What is of

Summary 67
interest in this context is the asymmetry. The basic clauses show a privi­ leged relationship between meaning and grammar; the nonbasic clause types do not show that relationship. Within the category of clause types in a language , the subcategory of basic clause types has a privileged status. This asymmetry between basic clause types and other clause types is a kind of prototype effect. Within the theory of grammatical constructions , described in case study 3 below, such prototype effects in grammar are characterized in the same way as other prototype effects , using the gen­ eral theory of cognitive models, which is set out in the remainder of this book.
Summary
Linguistic categories , like conceptual categories , show prototype ef­ fects . Such effects occur at every level of language, from phonology to morphology to syntax to the lexicon . I take the existence of such effects as prima facie evidence that linguistic categories have the same character as other conceptual categories . At this point I will adopt it as a working hy­ pothesis that language does make use of general cognitive mechanisms­ at least categorization mechanisms. Under this working hypothesis , we will use linguistic evidence to study the cognitive apparatus used in categorization. On the basis of all of the available evidence , I will argue in chapters 9-17 that our working hypothesis is indeed correct and that as a result our understanding of both language and cognition in general must be changed considerably.

Idealized Cognitive Models
Sources of Prototype Effects
The main thesis of this book is that we organize our knowledge by means of structures called idealized cognitive models , or ICMs , and that cate­ gory structures and prototype effects are by-products of that organiza­ tion . The ideas about cognitive models that we will be making use of have developed within cognitive linguistics and come from four sources: Fill­ more's frame semantics (Fillmore 1982b) , Lakoff and Johnson's theory of metaphor and metonymy (Lakoff and Johnson 1980) , Langacker's cogni­ tive grammar (Langacker 1986) , and Fauconnier's theory of mental spaces (Fauconnier 1985) . Fillmore's frame semantics is similar in many ways to schema theory (Rumelhart 1975) , scripts (Schank and Abelson 1977) , and frames with defaults (Minsky 1975). Each ICM is a complex structured whole, a gestalt, which uses four kinds of structuring princi­ ples:
- propositional structure, as in Fillmore's frames - image-schematic structure , as in Langacker's cognitive grammar - metaphoric mappings , as described by Lakoff and Johnson - metonymic mappings , as described by Lakoff and Johnson
Each ICM , as used, structures a mental space , as described by Faucon­ mer.
Probably the best way to provide an idea of what ICMs are and how they work in categorization is to go through examples. Let us begin with Fillmore's concept of a frame. Take the English word Tuesday. Tuesday can be defined only relative to an idealized model that includes the natu­ ral cycle defined by the movement of the sun , the standard means of char­ acterizing the end of one day and the beginning of the next, and a larger seven-day calendric cycle-the week . In the idealized model, the week is a whole with seven parts organized in a linear sequence; each part is called a day, and the third is Tuesday. Similarly, the concept weekend re-
68

The Simplest Prototype Effects 69
quires a notion of a work week of five days followed by a break of two days, superimposed on the seven-day calendar.
Our model of a week is idealized. Seven-day weeks do not exist objec­ tively in nature. They are created by human beings. In fact, not all cul­ tures have the same kinds of weeks. Consider, for example, the Balinese calendric system:
The two calendars which the Balinese employ are a lunar-solar one and one built around the interaction of independent cycles of day-names, which I shaH call "permutational." The permutational calendar is by far the most im­ portant. It consists of ten different cycles of day-names, following one an­ other in a fixed order, after which the first day-name appears and the cycle starts over. Similarly, there are nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, and even-the ultimate of a "contemporized" view of time--one day-name cycles. The names in each cycle are also different, and the cycles run concur­ rently . That is to say, any given day has, at least in theory, ten different names simultaneously applied to it, one from each of the ten cycles. Of the ten cycles, only those containing five, six, and seven day-names are of major cultural significance. . . . The outcome of all this wheels-within-wheels computation is a view of time as consisting of ordered sets of thirty , thirty­ five , forty-two and two hundred and ten quantum units ("days"). . . . To identify a day in the forty-two-day set-and thus assess its practical and/or religious significance--one needs to determine its place , that is, its name in the six-name cycle (say A riang) and in the seven-day cycle (say Boda): the day is Boda-Ariang, and one shapes one's actions accordingly. To identify a day in the thirty-five day set, one needs its place and name in the five-name
cycle (for example, Klion) and in the seven-: for exarr;Jle , Boda-Kliol1 . . . .
For the two-hundred-and-ten-day set, unique determination demands names from all three weeks: for example, Boda-Ariang-Klion, which, it so happens, is the day on which the most important Balinese holiday , Galungan , is cele­ brated. (Geertz 1973 , pp. 392-93)
Thus, a characterization of Galungan in Balinese requires a complex ICM which superimposes three week-structures--{)-ne five-day, one six-day , and one seven-day . In the cultures of the world, such idealized cognitive models can be quite complex.
The Simplest Prototype Effects
In general, any element of a cognitive model can correspond to a concep­ tual category. To be more specific, suppose schema theory in the sense of Rumelhart (1975) were taken as characterizing propositional models. Each schema is a network of nodes and links. Every node in a schema would then correspond to a conceptual category. The properties of the category would depend on many factors: the role of that node in the given

70 Chapter 4
schema, its relationship to other nodes in the schema, the relationship of that schema to other schemas , and the overall interaction of that schema with other aspects of the conceptual system. As we will see , there is more to ICMs than can be represented in schema theory. But at least those complexities do arise . What is particularly interesting is that even if one set up schema theory as one's theory of ICMs, and even if the categories defined in those schemas were classical categories, there would still be prototype effects-effects that would arise from the interaction of the given schema with other schemas in the system.
A clear example of this has heen given by Fillmore (1982a) . The exam­ ple is a classic: the category defined by the English word bachelor.
The noun bachelor can be defined as an unmarried adult man , but the noun clearly exists as a motivated device for categorizing people only in the con­ text of a human society in which certain expectations about marriage and marriageable age obtain . Male participants in long-term unmarried couplings
would not ordinarily be described as bachelors; a boy abandoned in the jun­ gle and grown to maturity away from contact with human society would not be called a bachelor; John Paul II is not properly thought of as a bachelor.
In other words , bachelor is defined with respect to an ICM in which there
is a human society with (typically monogamous) marriage, and a typical
marriageable age. The idealized model says nothing about the existence of priests, "long-term unmarried couplings," homosexuality, Moslems who are permitted four wives and only have three, etc. With respect to this idealized cognitive model, a bachelor is simply an unmarried adult man.
This idealized model, however, does not fit the world very precisely . It is oversimplified in its background assumptions . There are some segments of society where the idealized model fits reasonably well , and when an un­
married adult man might well be called a bachelor. But the ICM does not
fit the case of the pope or people abandoned in the jungle , like Tarzan . In such cases , unmarried adult males are certainly not representative mem­ bers of the category of bachelors.
The theory of ICMs would account for such prototype effects of the category bachelor in the following way: An idealized cognitive model may fit one's understanding of the world either perfectly , very well, pretty well , somewhat well, pretty badly, badly, or not at all . If the ICM in which bachelor is defined fits a situation perfectly and the person referred to by the term is unequivocally an unmarried adult male , then he qualifies as a member of the category bachelor. The person referred to deviates from prototypical bachelorhood if either the ICM fails to fit the world per­ fectly or the person referred to deviates from being an unmarried adult male.

The Simplest Prototype Effects 71
Under this account bachelor is not a graded category. It is an all-or­ none concept relative to the appropriate ICM. The ICM characterizes representative bachelors . One kind of gradience arises from the degree to which the ungraded ICM fits our knowledge (or assumptions) about the world.
This account is irreducibly cognitive. It depends on being able to take two cognitive models-one for bachelor and one characterizing one's knowledge about an individual, say the pope-and compare them , noting the ways in which they overlap and the ways in which they differ. One needs the concept of "fitting" one's ICMs to one's understanding of a given situation and keeping track of the respects in which the fit is imper­ fect.
This kind of explanation cannot be given in a noncognitive theory­ one in which a concept either fits the world as it is or not. The background conditions of the bachelor ICM rarely make a perfect seamless fit with the world as we know it. Still we can apply the concept with some degree of accuracy to situations where the background conditions don't quite mesh with our knowledge. And the worse the fit between the background conditions of the ICM and our knowledge, the less appropriate it is for us to apply the concept. The result is a gradience-a simple kind of proto­ type effect.
Lie
A case similar to Fillmore's bachelor example , but considerably more complex, has been discussed by Sweetser ( 1 984) . It is the category defined by the English word lie. Sweetser's analysis is based on experi­
mental results by Coleman and Kay (1981) on the use of the verb lie.
Coleman and Kay found that their informants did not appear to have necessary and sufficient conditions characterizing the meaning of lie. In­ stead they found a cluster of three conditions, no one of which was neces­ sary and all of which varied in relative importance:
A consistent pattern was found: falsity of belief is the most important ele­ ment of the prototype of lie, intended deception the next most important element, and factual falsity is the least important. Informants fairly easily and reliably assign the word lie to reported speech acts in a more-or-less, rather than all-or-none, fashion , . . . [and] . . . informants agree fairly gen­ erally on the relative weights of the elements in the semantic prototype of lie.
Thus, there is agreement that if you steal something and then claim you didn't, that's a good example of a lie. A less representative example of a lie is when you tell the hostess "That was a great party ! " when you were bored stiff. Or if you say something true but irrelevant, like "I'm going to

72 Chapter 4
the candy store , Ma" when you're really going to the pool hall, but will be stopping by the candy store on the way .
An important anomaly did , however, turn up in the Coleman-Kay study. When informants were asked to define a lie, they consistently said it was a false statement, even though actual falsity turned out consistently to be the least important element by far in the cluster of conditions. Sweetser has observed that the theory of ICMs provides an elegant way out of this anomaly. She points out that, in most everyday language use, we take for granted an idealized cognitive model of social and linguistic interaction . Here is my revised and somewhat oversimplified version of the ICM Sweetser proposes :
THE MAXIM OF HELPFULNESS
People intend to help one another.
This is a version of Grice's cooperative principle .
THE ICM OF ORDINARY COMMUNICATION
(a) If people say something, they're intending to help if and only if
they believe it. (b ) People intend to deceive if and only if they don't intend to help .
THE ICM OF JUSTIFIED BELIEF
(c) People have adequate reasons for their beliefs.
(d) What people have adequate reason to believe is true .
These two ICMs and the maxim of helpfulness govern a great deal of what we consider ordinary conversation , that is , conversation not con­ strained .by special circumstances. For example , if I told you I just saw a mutual friend, under ordinary circumstances you'd probably assume I was being helpful , that I wasn't trying to deceive you , that I believed I had seen the friend, and that I did in fact see the friend . That is , unless you have reason to believe that the maxim of helpfulness is not applying or that one of these idealized models is not applicable, you would simply take them for granted.
These I CMs provide an explanation of why speakers will define a lie as a false statement, when falsity is by far the least important of the three factors discovered by the Kay-Coleman study. These two ICMs each have an internal logic and when they are taken together, they yield some inter­
esting inferences . For example , it follows from (c) and (d) that if a person
believes something, he has adequate reasons for his beliefs , and if he has adequate reasons for believing the proposition, then it is true . Thus, in
the idealized world of these ICMs if X believes a proposition P, then P is
true. Conversely, if P is false , then X doesn't believe P. Thus , falsity en­ tails lack of belief.

The Simplest Prototype Effects 73

In this idealized situation , falsity also entails an intent to deceive . As

we have seen, falsity entails a lack of belief. By (a) , someone who says

something is intending to help if and only if he believes it. If he doesn't

believe it, then he isn't intending to help. And by (b) , someone who isn't

intending to help in giving information is intending to deceive. Thus, in

these ICMs , falsity entails both lack of belief and intent to deceive . Thus,

from the definition of a lie as a false statement, the other properties of ly­

ing follow as consequences. Thus, the definition of lie does not need to list

all these attributes . If lie is defined relative to these ICMs, then lack of be­

lief and intent to deceive follow from falsity.

As Sweetser points out, the relative importance of these conditions is a

consequence of their logical relations given these ICMs. Belief follows

from a lack of intent to deceive and truth follows from belief. Truth is of

the least concern since it is a consequence of the other conditions . Con­

versely , falsity is the most informative of the conditions in the idealized

model, since falsity entails both intent to deceive and lack of belief. It is

thus falsity that is the defining characteristic of a lie .

Sweetser's analysis provides both a simple , intuitive definition of lie

and an explanation of all of the Coleman-Kay findings . The ICMs used

are not made up j ust to account for lie. Rather they govern our everyday

common sense reasoning. These results are possible because the ICMs

have an internal logic . It is the structure of the ICMs that explains the

Coleman-Kay findings.

Coleman and Kay discovered prototype effects for the category /ie­

situations where subjects gave uniform rankings of how good an example

of a lie a given statement was . Sweetser's analysis explains these rankings

on the basis of her ICM analysis, even though her ICM fits the classical

theory! Nonprototypical cases are accounted for by imperfect fits of the

lying ICM to knowledge about the situation at hand . For example , white

lies and social lies occur in situations where condition (b) does not hold .

A white lie is a case where deceit is not harmful, and a social lie is a case

where deceit is helpful. In general, expressions such as social lie, white lie,

exaggeration, joke, kidding, oversimplification, tall tale, fiction, fib, mis­

take , etc . can be accounted for in terms of systematic deviations from the

above ICMs. Although ne

the­

ory of complex concepts in terms of the theory of ICMs, it is worth con­

sidering what would be involved in doing so. As should be obvious ,

adjective-noun expressions like social lie do not work according to tradi­

tional theories. The category of social lies is not the intersection of the set

of social things and the set of lies. The term social places one in a domain

of experience characterized by an ICM that says that being polite is more

74 Chapter 4
important than telling the truth . This conflicts with condition (b) , that intent to deceive is not helpful , and it overrides this condition . Saying "That was a great partyl " when you were bored stiff is a case where de­ ception is helpful to all concerned. It is a prototypical social lie , though it is not a prototypical lie . The concept social lie is therefore represented by an ICM that over laps in some respects with the lying ICM, but is different in an important way. The question that needs to be answered is whether the addition of the modifier social can account for this difference sys­ tematically . Any general account of complex concepts like social lie in terms of ICMs will have to indicate how the ICM evoked by social can cancel one condition of the ICM evoked by lie, while retaining the other conditions . An obvious suggestion would be that in conflicts between modifiers and heads , the modifiers win out . This would follow from the general cognitive principle that special cases take precedence over gen­ eral cases.
Cluster Models: A Second Source of Prototype Effects
It commonly happens that a number of cognitive models combine to form a complex cluster that is psychologically more basic than the models ta­ ken individually . We will refer to these as cluster models.
Mother An ex ample is the concept mother. According to the c l assical theory, it s hould be possible to give clear necessary and sufficient conditions for mother that will fit all the cases and apply equally to all of them . Such a definition might be something like: a woman who has given birth to a child. But as we will see , no such definition will cover the full range of cases . Mother is a concept that is based on a complex model in which a number of individual cognitive models combine , forming a cluster model . The models in the cluster are:
- The birth model: The person who gives birth is the mother.
The birth model is usually accompanied by a genetic model, although since the development of egg and embryo implants, they do not always coincide.
- The genetic model: The female who contributes the genetic material is the mother.
- The nurturance model: The female adult who nurtures and raises a child is the mother of that child .
- The marital model: The wife of the father is the mother. - The genealogical model: The closest female ancestor is the mother.

Cluster Models 75
The concept mother normally involves a complex model in which all of these individual models combine to form a cluster model. There have al­ ways been divergences from this cluster; stepmothers have been around for a long time. B ut because of the complexities of modern life, the mod­ els in the cluster have come to diverge more and more . Still, many people feel the pressure to pick one model as being the right one, the one that "really" defines what a mother is. But although one might try to argue that only one of these characterizes the "real" concept of mother, the lin­ guistic evidence does not bear this out. As the following sentences indi­ cate , there is more than one criterion for "real" motherhood :
- I was adopted and I don't know who my real mother is. - I am not a nurturant person, so I don't think I could ever be a real
mother to any child . .- My real mother died when I was an embryo , and I was frozen and
later implanted in the womb of the woman who gave birth to me . - I had a genetic mother who contributed the egg that was planted in
the womb of my real mother, who gave birth to me and raised me. - By genetic engineering, the genes in the egg my father's sperm fertil­
ized were spliced together from genes in the eggs of twenty different women. I wouldn't call any of them my real mother. My real mother is the woman who bore and raised me , even though I don't have any sin­ gle genetic mother.
In short, more than one of these models contributes to the characteriza­ tion of a real mother, and any one of them may be absent from such a characterization . Still, the very idea that there is such a thing as a real mother seems to require a choice among models where they diverge . It would be bizarre for someone to say :
- I have four real mothers : the woman who contributed my genes , the woman who gave birth to me, the woman who raised me , and my fa­ ther's current wife .
When the cluster of models that jointly characterize a concept diverge , there is still a strong pull to view one as the most important. This is reflected in the institution of dictionaries . Each dictionary, by historical convention , must list a primary meaning when a word has more than one . Not surprisingly , the human beings who write dictionaries var y in their choices . Dr. Johnson chose the birth model as primar y, and many of the applied linguists who work for the publishers of dictionaries, as is so often the case, have simply played it safe and copied him. B ut not all. Funk and Wagnall's Standard chose the nurturance model as primary, while the American College Dictionary chose the genealogical model . Though

76 Chapter 4
choices made by dictionary-makers are of no scientific importance , they do reflect the fact that, even among people who construct definitions for a living , there is no single , generally accepted cognitive model for such a common concept as "mother."
When the situation is such that the models for mother do not pick out a single individual , we get compound expressions like stepmother, surro­ gate mother, adoptive mother, Jaster mother, biological mother, donor mother, etc. Such compounds , of course, do not represent simple sub­ categories , that is, kinds of ordinary mothers. Rather, they describe cases where there is a lack of convergence of the various models .
And , not surprisingly , different models are used as the basis of differ­ ent extended senses of mother. For example , the birth model is the basis of the metaphorical sense in
- Necessity is the mother of invention.
while the nurturance model is basis for the derived verb in
- He wants his girlfriend to mother him.
The genealogical model is the basis for the metaphorical extension of mother and daughter used in the description of the tree diagrams that lin­ guists use to describe sentence structure. If node A is immediately above node B in a tree , A is called the mother and B, the daughter. Even in the case of metaphorical extensions, there is no single privileged model for mother on which the extensions are based . This accords with the evidence cited above which indicates. that the concept mother is defined by a cluster model.
This phenomenon is beyond the scope of the classical theory . The con­ cept mother is not clearly defined , once and for all, in terms of common necessary and sufficient conditions. There need be no necessary and suf­ ficient conditions for motherhood shared by normal biological mothers , donor mothers (who donate an egg) , surrogate mothers (who bear the ' child , but may not have donated the egg) , adoptive mothers , unwed mothers who give their children up for adoption , and stepmothers . They are all mothers by virtue of their relation to the ideal case, where the models ·converge. That ideal case is one of the many kinds of cases that give rise to prototype effects .

5 CHAPTE R
Metonymic Models
Metonymy is one of the basic characteristics of cognition . It is extremely common for people to take one well-understood or easy-to-perceive aspect of something and use it to stand either for the thing as a whole or for some other aspect or part of it. The best-known cases are those like the following:
- One waitress says to another, "The ham sandwich just spilled beer all over himself."
Here the ham sandwich is standing for the person eating the sandwich . A nother well-known example is the slogan:
- Don't let El Salvador become another Vietnam. Here the place is standing for the events that occurred at that place . As Lakoff and Johnson ( 1980, chap. 8) showed , such examples are instances of general principles ; they do not just occur one by one . For example , English has a general principle by which a place may stand for an institu­ tion located at that place:
- The White House isn't saying anything. - Washington is insensitive to the needs of ordinar y people. - The Kremlin threated to boycott the next round of talks. - Paris is introducing shorter skirts this season. - Hollywood isn't what it used to be. - Wall Street is in a panic. In each of these cases, a place like The Kremlin is standing for an institu­ tion located at that place, like the Soviet government. Moreover, the principle applies to an open-ended class of cases , not to any fixed list. For example , suppose that I am running a company that has many branch offices , including one in Cleveland, and I have asked each branch to send
77

78 Chapter 5

in a report on how it is doing. Upon failure to receive a report from the branch in Cleveland , I could say :
- Cleveland hasn't reported.

The point is that a general principle is needed because one cannot list all the examples. Since such general principles are not the same in all lan­ guages , one cannot simply say that anything can stand for anything else in
the right context. One needs to distinguish which principles work for
which languages . Such principles take the following form : Given an ICM with some
background condition (e .g. , institutions are located in places) , there is a "stands for" relation that may hold between two elements A and B , such that one element of the ICM, B, may stand for another element A . In this case , B = the place and A = the institution . We will refe r to such ICMs containing stands··for rel ations as metonymic models .
A particularly interesting case of metonymy occurs in giving answers to questions . It is common to give an answer that evokes the information re­
quested , and there seem to be language-particular metonymic models used to do so. Take , for example , the case described by Rhodes (1977) , a linguist who does fieldwork on Oj ibwa , a Native American language of central Canada. As part of his fieldwork , he asked speakers of Ojibwa who had come to a party how they got there . He got answers like the fol­
lowing (translated into English) :

- I started to come. - I stepped into a canoe. - I got into a car.

He figured out what was going on when he read Schank and Abelson's Scripts, Plans, Goals, and Understanding ( 1977) . Going somewhere in a vehicle involves a structured scenario (or in our terms, an ICM) :

Precondition : You have (or have access to) the vehicle . Embarcation: You get into the vehicle and start it up. Center: You drive (row, fly, etc.) to your destination . Finish : You park and get out . End point: You are at your destination.

What Rhodes found was that in Ojibwa it is conventional to use the em­

barcation point of an ICM of this sort to evoke the whole ICM . That is , in

answering questions, part of an ICM is used to stand for the whole . In

Ojibwa, that part is the Ojibwa does not look

from the same point of view. What are possible normal answers to a ques­ tion such as "How did you get to the party?"
- I drove. (Center stands for whole ICM .) - I have a car. (Precondition stands for whole ICM . ) - I borrowed my brother's car. (This entails the precondition, which in
turn stands for the whole ICM. )
English even has special cases that look something like Ojibwa.
- I hopped on a bus. (Embarcation stands for whole ICM.) - I just stuck out my thumb. (Embarcation stands for whole ICM . )
In short, English can use the embarcation metonymicaliy to stand for the whole ICM , j ust in case there is no further effort involved, as in taking a bus or hitchhiking .
There are many metonymic models in a rich conceptual system , and they are used for a wide variety of purposes. The kind of most interest for our present purposes are those in which a member or subcategory can stand metonymically for the whole category for the purpose of making in­ ferences or judgments.
Metonymic Sou rces of Prototype Effects
As Rosch ( 1 978) observed , prototype effects are surface phenomena. A major source of such effects is metonymy-a situation in which some sub­ category or member or submodel is used (often for some limited and im­ mediate purpose) to comprehend the categor y as a whole. In other words , these are cases where a part (a subcategor y or member or suu­ model) stands for the whole categor y-in reasoning , recognition , etc. Within the theor y of cognitive models , such cases are represented by metonymic models .
The Housewife Stereotype
We have seen how the clustering of cognitive models for mother results in prototype effects . However , an additional level of prototype ef­ fects occurs in the mother categor y. The source of these effects is the stereotype of the mother as housewife . Social stereotypes are cases of me­ tonymy-where a subcategory has a socially recognized status as standing for the category as a whole, usually for the purpose of making quick judg­ ments about people . The housewife-mother subcategory, though un­ named , exists . It defines cultural expectations about what a mother is sup-

80 Chapter 5
posed to be. And because of this , it yields prototype effects . On the whole in our culture , housewife-mothers are taken as better examples of mothers than nonhousewife-mothers .
Such goodness-of-example judgments are a kind of prototype effect . B ut this effect is not due to the clustering of models , but rather to the case of a metonymic model in which one subcategory, the housewife-mother, stands for the whole category in defining cultural expectations of mothers . Other kinds of metonymic models will be discussed below.
Working Mothers
A working mother is not simply ,a mother who happens to be working. The category working mother is defined in contrast to the stereotypi­ cal housewife-mother . The housewife-mother stereotype arises from a stereotypical view of nurturance, which is associated with the nurturance model . According to the stereotypical view , mothers who do not stay at home all day with their children cannot properly nurture them . There is also a stereotypical view of work , according to which it is done away from the home, and housework and child-rearing don't count . This is the stereotype that the bumpersticker "Every Mother Is a Working Mother" is meant to counter.
The housewife-mother stereotype is therefore defined relative to the nurturance model of motherhood . This may be obvious , but it is not a trivial fact . It shows that metonymic models like stereotypes are not necessarily defined with respect to an entire cluster. In this case , the met­ onymic model is characterized relative to only one of the models in the cluster-the nurturance model. Here is some rather subtle 'evidence to prove the point :
Consider an unwed mother who gives up her child for adoption and then goes out and gets a job. She is still a mother , by virtue of the birth model, and she is working-but she is not a working mother!
The reason is that it is the nurturance model, not the birth model, that is relevant . Thus , a biological mother who is not responsible for nurturance cannot be a working mother , though an adoptive mother, of course , can be one.
This example shows the following:
- A social stereotype (e .g. , the housewife-mother) may be defined with respect to only one of the base models of an experiential cluster (e.g. , the nurturance model).
- Thus , a metonymic model where a subcategory stands for the whole

Working Mothers 8 1
categor y may be defined relative to only one model i n a complex clus­ ter. - A subcategory (e.g . , working mother) may be defined in contrast with a stereotype (e.g. , the housewife-mother) . - When this occurs , it is only the relevant cognitive model (e.g. , the nurturance model) that is used as a background for defining the sub­ category (e . g . , working mother) .
Thus , only those mothers for whom nurturance is an issue can be so cate­ gorized . Stepmothers and adoptive mothers may also be working mothers , but biological mothers who have given up their children for adoption and surrogate mothers (who have only had a child for someone else) are not working mothers-even though they may happen to be hold­ ing down a job.
Such models of stereotypes are important for a theory of conceptual structure in a number of ways . First , as we have seen , they may be used to motivate and define a contrasting subcategory like working mother. This is important because , according to the classical theory, such cases should not exist. In the classical theory, social stereotypes, by definition, play no role in defining category structure , because they are not part of any neces­ sary and sufficient conditions for category membership ! In the classical theor y, only necessary and sufficient conditions can have a real cognitive function in defining category membership. For this reason , the classical theory permits no cognitive function at all for social stereotypes . But the fact that the conceptual category working mother is defined by contrast with the housewife-mother stereotype indicates that stereotYFs do have a role in characterizing concepts.
The second way in which stereotypes are important for conceptual structure is that they define normal expectations . Normal expectations play an important role in cognition , and they are required in order to characterize the meanings of certain words. For example, the word but in English is used to mark a situation which is in contrast to some model that serves as a norm . Stereotypic models may serve as such a norm :
Normal : She is a mother, but she isn't a housewife . Strange : She is a mother, but she's a housewife .
The latter sentence could only be used if stereotypical mothers were not housewives . Conversely , a category defined in contrast to a stereotype has the opposite properties.
Normal : She is a mother, but she has a job. Strange : She is a mother, but she doesn't have a job .

Similar complexities arise for unwed mother. An unwed mother is not simply a mother who is not married . For example , an adoptive mother who is not married is not a unwed mother. And we would normally not use the term unwed mother for a millionaire actress who chose to have a child out of wedlock . Unwed mother is defined relative to the birth model . Hence , adoptive mothers , foster mothers , egg donors, etc. don't count . In the stereotypical case , the unwed mother did not choose to get preg­ nant, and she has difficulty supporting the child.
The term daddy is defined relative to a nurturance model , not just a birth model . Thus , one may ask of an unmarried pregnant woman Who is the child's father? but not Who is the child's daddy ? One may be called a father before one may be called a daddy .
In summary, we have seen two kinds of models for mother:
- a cluster of converging cognitive models - a stereotypic model, which is a metonymic model in which the house-
wife-mother subcategory stands for the category as whole and serves the purpose of defining cultural expectations
Both models give rise to prototype effects, but in different ways. To­ gether, they form a structure with a composite prototype : the best exam­ ple of a mother is a biological mother who is a housewife principally con­ cerned with nurturance , not working at a paid position, and married to the child's father. This composite prototype imposes what is called a rep­ resentativeness structure on the category: the closer an individual is to the prototype, the more rtpresentative a mother she is.
Representativeness structures are linear. They concern nothing but closeness to the prototypical case, and thus they hide most of the richness of structure that exists in the cognitive models that characterize the cate­ gory. Representativeness structures , though real, are mere shadows of cognitive models.
It is important to bear this in mind, since prototype theory is some­ times thought of as involving only such linear representativeness struc­ tures and not cognitive models.
The study of representativeness structures has played an important role in the history of prototype theory-largely in demonstrating that prototypes do exist and in making a bare first approximation to finding out what they are and what properties they have . But a full study of category structure must go well beyond just isolating a prototype and giving a lin­ ear ranking of how close nonprototypical cases are . At the very least, it must provide an account of the details of the cognitive models that give rise to the representativeness structure .

Radial Structures 83
Radial Structures
Here are some kinds of mothers:
- The central case , where all the models converge , includes a mother w ho is and always has been female , and who gave birth to the child , supplied her half of the child's genes , nurtured the child , is married to the father , is one generation older than the child , and is the child's le­ gal guardian.
- Stepmother: She didn't give birth or supply the genes, but she is cur­ rently married to the father.
- Adoptive mother: She didn't give birth or supply the genes , but she is the legal guardian and has the obligation to provide nurturance .
- Birth mother: This is defined in contrast to adoptive mother; given an adoption reM , the woman who gives birth and puts the child up for adoption is called the birth mother.
- Natural mother: This was once the term used to contrast with adop­ tive mother, but it has been given up because of the unsavory infer­ ence that adoptive mothers were , by contrast , "unnatural." This term has been repl aced by birth mother.
- Foster mother: She did not give birth to the child , and is being paid by the state to provide nurturance .
- Biological mother: She gave birth to the child, but is not raising �t and there is someone else who is and who qualifies to be called a mother of some sort.
- Surrogate mother: She has contracted to give birth and that's all . She may or may not have provided the genes , and she is not married to the father and is not obligated to provide nurturance . And she has con­ tractually given up the right to be legal guardian .
- Unwed mother: She is not married at the time she gives birth . - Genetic mother: This is a term r have seen used for a woman who sup-
plies an egg to be planted in someone else's womb and has nothing else whatever to do with the child . It has not yet to my knowledge be­ come conventional.
These subcategories of mother are all understood as deviations from the central case. But not all possible variations on the central case exist as categories. There is no categor y of mothers who are legal guardians but who don't personally supply nurturance, but hire someone else to do it. There is no category of transsexuals who gave birth but have since had a sex-change operation. Moreover, some of the above categories are prod­ ucts of the twentieth century and simply did not exist before. The point is

84 Chapter 5
that the central case does not productively generate all these subcatego­ ries . Instead , the subcategories are defined by convention as variations on the central case. There is no general rule for generating kinds of mothers. They are culturally defined and have to be learned . They are by no means the same in all cultures . In the Trobriands , a woman who gives birth often gives the child to an old woman to raise. In traditional Japanese society, it was common for a woman to give her child to her sister to raise. Both of these are cases of kinds of mothers that we don't have an exact equiva­ lent of.
The categor y of mother in this culture has what we will call a radial structure. A radial structure is one where there is a central case and con­ ventionalized variations on it which cannot be predicted by general rules . Categories that are generated by central cases plus general principles­ say , the natural numbers or Lounsbur y's account of the categor y mater­ nal uncle in Fox-are not radial structures , as we are defining the term . We are limiting radial structures only to cases where the variations are conventionalized and have to be learned . We are also ruling out cases where the central case is j ust more general than the noncentral case-that is , where the noncentral cases just have more properties than the central case, but no different ones . Radial structures are extremely common , and we will discuss them in ver y great detail below.
Some Kinds of Metonymic Models
So far , we have looked at one case of a metonymic model: the housewife­ mother stereotype . It defines a subcategor y that is used to stand for the entire categor y of mothers in defining social expectations . Any time a subcategor y (or an individual member of a category) is used for some purpose to stand for the category as a whole , it is a potential source of prototype effects. For this reason, metonymic models play an important role in prototype theory. Let us look at them a bit more closely .
In general, a metonymic model has the following characteristics :
- There is a "target" concept A to be understood for some purpose in some context.
- There is a conceptual structure containing both A and another con­ cept B.
- B is either part of A or closely associated with it in that conceptual structure. Typically , a choice of B will uniquely determine A , within that conceptual structure .
- Compared to A , B is either easier to understand , easier to remember, easier to recognize, or more immediately useful for the given purpose in the given context.
