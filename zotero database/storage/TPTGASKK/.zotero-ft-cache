Studies in the Social and Cultural Foundations of Language

The aim of this series is to develop theoretical perspectives on the essential social and cultural character of language by methodological and empirical emphasis on the occurrence of language in its communicative and interactional settings, on the sociocuhurally grounded "meanings" and "functions" of linguistic forms, and on the social scientific study of language use across cultures. It will thus explicate the essentially ethnographic nature of linguistic data, whether spontaneously occurring or experimentally induced, whether normative or variational, whether synchronic or diachronic. Works appearing in the series will make substantive and theoretical contributions to the debate over the socioculluralfunctional and structural-formal nature of language, and will represent the concerns of scholars in the sociology and anthropology of language, anthropological linguistics, sociolinguistics, and socio-culturally informed psycholinguistics.

INTRODUCTION: LINGUISTIC RELATIVITY RE-EXAMINED
JOHN J. GUMPERZ AND STEPHEN C. LEVINSON
Quelle est Pinfluence reciproque des opinions du peuple sur le langage et du langage sur les opinions?
The theme of the 1757 Prize Essay Competition of the Berlin Academy.1
1 Language, thinking, and reality
Every student of language or society should be familiar with the essential idea of linguistic relativity, the idea that culture, through language, affects the way we think, especially perhaps our classification of the experienced world. Much of our experience seems to support some such idea, for example the phenomenology of struggling with a second language, where we find that the summit of competence is forever over the next horizon, the obvious absence of definitive or even accurate translation (let alone the ludicrous failure of phrasebooks), even the wreck of diplomatic efforts on linguistic and rhetorical rocks.
On the other hand, there is a strand of robust common sense that insists that a stone is a stone whatever you call it, that the world is a recalcitrant reality that imposes its structure on our thinking and our speaking and that the veil of linguistic difference can be ripped aside with relative ease. Plenty of subjective experiences and objective facts can be marshalled to support this view: the delight of foreign friendships, our ability to "read" the military or economic strategies of alien rivals, the very existence of comparative sciences of language, psychology, and society.2
These two opposing strands of "common sense" have surfaced in academic controversies and intellectual positions over many centuries of Western thought. If St. Augustine (354-430) took the view that language is a mere nomenclature for antecedently existing concepts, Roger Bacon (1220-92) insisted, despite strong views on the universal basis of grammar, that the mismatch between semantic fields in different languages made accurate translation impossible (Kelly 1979:9).3 The Port Royal grammarians of the seventeenth century found universal logic thinly disguised behind linguistic difference, while the German romantics

in a tradition leading through to Humboldt in the nineteenth century found a unique Weltanschauung, "world view," in each language. The first half of our own century was characterized by the presumption of radical linguistic and cultural difference reflecting profound cognitive differences, a presumption to be found in anthropology, linguistics and behaviourist psychologies, not to mention philosophical emphasis on meaning as use. The second half of the century has been dominated by the rise of the cognitive sciences, with their treatment of mind as inbuilt capacities for information processing, and their associated universalist and rationalist presuppositions. St. Augustine would probably recognize the faint echoes of his views in much modern theorizing about how children acquire language through prior knowledge of the structure of the world.
There is surely some spiral ascent in the swing of this pendulum. Nevertheless it is important to appreciate how little real scientific progress there has been in the study of lexical or morphosyntactic meaning - most progress in linguistics has been in the study of syntax and sound systems, together with rather general ideas about how the meaning of phrases might be composed out of the meaning of their constituents. Thus there is still much more opinion (often ill-informed) than solid fact in modern attitudes to "linguistic relativity."
There are three terms in the relation: language, thought, and culture. Each of these are global cover terms, not notions of any precision. When one tries to make anything definite out of the idea of linguistic relativity, one inevitably has to focus on particular aspects of each of these terms in the relation.4 This book will show how each can be differently construed and, as a consequence, the relation reconsidered. In addition the connecting links can be variously conceived. Thus by the end of the book the reader will find that the aspects of language and thinking that are focused on are selective, but also that the very relation between culture and community has become complex. Readers will find the original idea of linguistic relativity still live, but functioning in a way that differs from how it was originally conceived.

2 Linguistic relativity re-examined
The original idea, variously attributable to Humboldt, Boas, Sapir, Whorf, was that the semantic structures of different languages might be fundamentally incommensurable, with consequences for the way in which speakers of specific languages might think and act. On this view, language, thought, and culture are deeply interlocked, so that each language might be claimed to have associated with it a distinctive worldview.5

Introduction: linguistic relativity re-examined

These ideas captured the imagination of a generation of anthropologists, psychologists, and linguists, as well as members of the general public. They had deep implications for the way anthropologists should ;onduct their business, suggesting that translational difficulties might lie it the heart of their discipline.6 However, the ideas seemed entirely and abruptly discredited by the rise of the cognitive sciences in the 1960s, which favoured a strong emphasis on the commonality of human ;ognition and its basis in human genetic endowment. This emphasis was strengthened by developments within linguistic anthropology, with the discovery of significant semantic universals in color terms, the structure DF ethnobotanical nomenclature, and (arguably) kinship terms.
However, there has been a recent change of intellectual climate in psychology, linguistics, and other disciplines surrounding anthropology, as well as within linguistic anthropology, towards an intermediate position, in which more attention is paid to linguistic and cultural difference, such diversity being viewed within the context of what we have learned about universals (features shared by all languages and cultures). Mew work in developmental psychology, while acknowledging underlying universal bases, emphasizes the importance of the socio-cultural context of human development. Within sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology there has also been increasing attention to meaning and discourse, and concomitantly a growing appreciation of how interpretive differences can be rooted as much in the systematic uses of language as in its structure.7
2.1 The "classical" hypothesis: some historical background
Speculation about the relation between language, culture, and thought can probably be traced back to the dawn of philosophy. We cannot here give an adequate history of the ideas, which has yet to be written from the current perspective, and would in any case connect closely to the entire treatment of epistemology and ontology in two millennia of speculations about language and mind. Many early classical and medieval controversies centered on issues of translation, which have always played a central role in Christian thinking.8 Speculations about the origin of language in the course of human cognitive and cultural development, and debate about whether language presupposes or instead makes available abstract symbolic thought, also have a long history, with celebrated controversies in the eighteenth century.9 The process of conquest and colonialism also brought forth from its beginning many ruminations on the role of language in perceived cultural superiority.10 Thus in a number of arenas, theological, philosophical, legal, and colonial, there have been for centuries wellrehearsed debates about the mutual dependence or independence of

language and thought, and about the relation between social systems and that interdependence.
Special conditions reinvigorated the debate in the first half of this century in America.1' Suffice it to say here that the phrase linguistic relativity achieved notoriety through its use by Whorf, and that the basis of Whorf's ideas can be lineally traced through Sapir to Boas, or alternatively through (German-trained) Whitney and other early American linguists, and thus to Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767-1835), the great German educator, linguist, and philosopher.'2 From there the conventional history has it that the trail leads to Herder and the German romantics, and on back to Leibniz in opposition to the enlightenment ideas of Universal Grammar and words as mere nomenclature for preexisting concepts.13 The lineage is both stepwise and direct: e.g. Sapir wrote a master's thesis on a comparison between Herder and Humboldt, while Boas of course embodied the transatlantic migration of the German tradition.14
However, this potted history is now known to be at least partially misleading, because Humboldt also directly absorbed French eighteenthcentury ideas, some of which, by the close of the century, almost sketched his own program (Aarsleff 1988).l5 Those ideas were transmitted through multiple channels to America, directly (e.g. in the person of Du ponceau, an early student of Amerindian languages), and indirectly through Humboldt's correspondence in the 1820s and 1830s with Pickering, Duponceau, and others,16 through publication of Humboldt's works in translation as early as 1885, and via Steinthal's writings to Whitney by 1867.17
An additional source of these ideas is the growth of early twentiethcentury structuralism.18 For example, the Saussurean notion of valeur, wherein an expression picks up distinctive meaning through its opposition to other expressions, has the implication that the content of linguistic expressions depends on the system in which they are embedded, rather than in the first instance on their denotation.19 Since no two linguistic systems or subsystems arc ever identical, as is easily shown by comparison of semantic fields from English vs. French, linguistic relativity more or less follows. This form of linguistic relativism is historically tied to the cultural relativism immanent in Durkheim's later sociological ideas, which still (despite protestations to the contrary) dominate anthropological ideas. Anthropologists, as indeed do many field linguists, take these kind of structuralist ideas as a methodological presupposition: "strive to understand the native ideas in the context of the entire local system of ideas, leaving comparison to be made between systems, not between isolated words or traits across systems." It is hard to quarrel with this as a methodological stance, but it is a reasonable

charge that subscribers to this doctrine have mistaken methodological prescription for theory: the result of comparison between systems may be a robust finding of universal principles governing individual traits.
The essential point here is that the ideas we associate today so especially with Whorf and Sapir have a long and distinguished lineage on the one hand, while perhaps being no more than one of two opposing perennial strands of thought, universalism vs. relativism, on the other. Nevertheless, they crystallized in a particular fashion in American intellectual life of the 1940s.20 The idea of a close link between linguistic and conceptual categories took on a new meaning in the context of three further background assumptions characteristic of the first half of the century. One was the presumption of a (sometimes tempered) empiricist epistemology, that is, the view that all knowledge is acquired primarily through experience. The other was the structuralist assumption that language forms a system of oppositions, such that formal distinctions directly reflect meaning distinctions.21 The third was the idea of an unconscious mental life, and thus the possibility of linguistic effects beyond conscious awareness. It was the conjunction of these background ideas together with the specific formulation of the "linguistic relativity" hypothesis, that gave that hypothesis its particular character in the history of ideas.
Sapir may have originated the phrase,22 but the locus classicus (though by no means the most careful statement) of the concept of linguistic relativity is the popular articles by Whorf (1940a-b, reprinted 1956:207-33), where the following oft-quoted passages may be found which illustrate all the central themes.

Epistemology
We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native languages. The categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do not find there because they stare every observer in the face; on the contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscopic flux of impressions which has to be organized by our minds - and this means largely by the linguistic systems of our minds.
(1956:213)

Structuralism

Pattern-symbolic expressions [i.e. linguistic notations of inherent linguistic

patterning] are exact, as mathematics is, but are not quantitative. They do not

refer ultimately to number and dimension, as mathematics does, but to pattern

and structure.

(1956:226)

Quantity and number play little role in the realm of pattern, where there are no

variables but, instead, abrupt alternations from one configuration to another. The

mathematical sciences require exact measurement, but what linguistics requires

is, rather, exact "patlernmenl."

(1956:230-I)23

John J. Gumperz and Stephen C. Levinson

Unconscious thought
[T]he phenomena of language are to its own speakers largely of a background character and so are outside the critical consciousness and control of the speaker.
(1956: 211)

Linguistic relativity
The phenomena of language are background phenomena, of which the talkers are unaware or, at most, dimly aware... These automatic, involuntary patterns of language are not the same for all men but are specific for each language and constitute the formalized side of the language, or its "grammar"...
From this fact proceeds what I have called the "linguistic relativity principle," which means, in informal terms, that users of markedly different grammars are pointed by their grammars toward different types of observations and different evaluations of externally similar acts of observation, and hence are not equivalent as observers, but must arrive at somewhat different views of the world.
(1956:221)

Or in alternative formulation:

We are thus introduced to a new principle of relativity, which holds that all

observers are not led by the same physical evidence to the same picture of the

universe, unless their linguistic backgrounds are similar, or can in some way be

calibrated.

(1956:214)

The boldness of Whorf *s formulation prompted a succession of empirical studies in America in the 1950s and early 1960s aimed at elucidating and testing what now became known as the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.24 Anthropological and linguistic studies by Trager, Hoijer, Lee, Casagrande, and others have been well reviewed elsewhere (see Lucy 1992a: ch. 3; and this volume).25 These studies hardly touched on cognition, but in the same period a few psychologists (notably Lenneberg, Brown, Stefflre) did try to investigate the relation between lexical coding and memory, especially in the domain of color, and found some significant correlations (again see Lucy 1992a: ch. 5). This line of work culminated, however, in the celebrated demonstration by Berlin & Kay (1969) of the language-independent saliency of "basic colors," which was taken as a decisive anti-relativist finding, and effectively terminated this tradition of investigations into the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis.26 There followed a period in which Whorf's own views in particular became the butt of extensive criticism.27
It is clear from this background that the "Sapir-Whorf" hypothesis in its classical form arose from deep historical roots but in a particular intellectual climate. Even though (it has been closely argued by Lucy 1992a) the original hypothesis has never been thoroughly tested, the intellectual milieu had by the 1960s entirely changed. Instead of empiricism, we now have rationalistic assumptions. Instead of the basic tenets of structuralism, in which each linguistic or social system must be

understood first in internal terms before comparison is possible, modern comparative work (especially in linguistics) tends to presume that one can isolate particular aspects or traits of a system (e.g. aspect or subjecthood) for comparison. The justification, such as it is, is that we now have the outlines of a universal structure for language and perhaps cognition, which provides the terms for comparison. It is true that the assumption of unconscious processes continues, but now the emphasis is on the unconscious nature of nearly all systematic information processing, so that the distinctive character of Whorf's habitual thought has been submerged.28
In this changed intellectual climate, and in the light of the much greater knowledge that we now have about both language and mental processing, it would be pointless to attempt to revive ideas about linguistic relativity in their original form. Nevertheless, there have been a whole range of recent intellectual shifts that make the ground more fertile for some of the original seeds to grow into new saplings. It is the purpose of this volume to explore the implications of some of these shifts in a number of different disciplines for our overall view of the relations between language, thinking, and society.

2.2 The idea behind the present volume
This volume explores one chain of reasoning that is prompted by these recent changes in ideas. The line of argument runs in the following way.
Linguistic relativity is a theory primarily about the nature of meaning, the classic view focusing on the lexical and grammatical coding of language-specific "distinctions. In this theory, two languages may "code" the same state of affairs utilizing semantic concepts or distinctions peculiar to each language; as a result the two linguistic descriptions reflect different construals of the same bit of reality. These semantic distinctions are held to reflect cultural distinctions and at the same time to influence cognitive categorizations, an issue re-examined in part I below.
Assuming that there is such a link between linguistic structure and conceptual categories, the possibility of conceptual relativity would seem at first sight to depend on whether linguistic codings are significantly different across languages. Very little, however, is actually known about substantive semantic or conceptual universals. It is true that there are demonstrations of universal semantic principles in a few domains like color terminology, ethnobiological taxonomies, perhaps also in systems of kinship terminology. However, these demonstrations carry no necessary general implications, and the same holds for studies of grammatical meaning. These issues are discussed in part II below.

8

John J. Gumperz and Stephen C. Le Vinson

Yet, on further reflection, distinctive linguistic (grammatical or lexical) codings are not the only ways in which "meanings" or interpretations can vary systematically across cultures. This is brought out by recent developments in the theory of meaning. These developments show that "meaning" is not fully encapsulated in lexicon and grammar, which provide only schematic constraints on what the speaker will be taken to have meant in a particular utterance. These ideas are quite general across the different theories and frameworks which typify modern linguistics. For example, the same point is made in very different ways in formal semantic theories like Discourse Representation Theory29 or Situation Semantics,30 where contextual determination of interpretation is one of the main issues driving development away from classical truth-conditional theories. Equally, in different varieties of pragmatic theory, from Relevance Theory31 to more conservative Gricean theories,32 current work is addressed to explaining how almost vacuous or semantically general expressions can have determinate interpretations in particular contexts.
These changes in the theory of meaning have been prompted quite largely by the phenomena of deixis, the existence in all natural languages of a plethora of (indexical or deictic) expressions that only refer relative to a context: if you find a note on the ground that says "See you here in ten minutes from now," you will be puzzled about who you denotes, where the place here refers to, and when the countdown from now began. The semantics of these expressions is designed to fix a reference only when given a context by the situation of utterance. But these are simple examples. The kind of contextual information that is actually needed turns out to be deeply embedded in practices of speaking, the local conduct of social life, and the social distribution of shared understandings, All this is the subject of part III of this book.
A large part of the burden of interpretation is thus shifted from theories of context-free lexical and grammatical meaning to theories of use in context. Some important principles of the use of language may plausibly be argued to be universal (e.g. Grice's "maxims of conversation" or the turn-taking and repair systems of conversation, or even some principles of interactional politeness). Yet others seem much more clearly culture-specific. For example, the ethnography of speaking has shown how diverse can be the principles governing the production and interpretation of utterances in specific speech events - court proceedings, formal greetings, religious rituals, councils, and the like. Recent work, however, shows that we cannot always think of speech events as antecedently constructed, forming the frame or context for interpretation. Sometimes, through modulation of the verbal interaction itself, these contextual frames can be invoked, so that utterances can carry with them, or project, the context in which they should be interpreted. These

9

are subtle, culture-specific, processes, learnt within the social networks that utilize them.
In that case, aspects of meaning and interpretation are determined by culture-specific activities and practices. Those activities and practices are interconnected in turn with the larger socio-political systems that govern, and are in turn partly constituted by, them: particular divisions of labor and social networks provide differentia 1 access to such activities and the associated patterns of language use. All these issues are the focus of part IV, the final part of the book.
This book therefore spans a large terrain, from the classic Whorfian issues of the relation of grammar to thought on the one hand to consideration of language use in sociolinguistic perspective on the other. One key idea that supports this span is the notion of indexicality, conceived not just in terms of the contextual dependence of deictic items, but also in the broader Peircean sense, as a broad relationship between interpreters, signals, and the context of interpretation.33 Indexicality necessarily anchors meaning and interpretation to the context of language use and thus to wider social organization. Issues of linguistic relativity are in this way directly related to the variable cultural structuring of contexts.
Another idea is more latent in the book. If new theories of language make possible new connections between meaning and context, there are also new, if still incipient, ideas about the nature of thinking and context. One line of thought explores the idea of "technologies of the intellect": by externalizing thoughts or representing them, we are able to manipulate them in quite different ways. Goody (1977) has argued that literacy makes available multidimensional scanning of what is essentially a linear medium (consider a table of figures, which can be examined from the perspective of either its columns or its rows). Another line of investigation explores how we solve intellectual tasks by embedding them in practical activities: for example, a trucker may estimate loads in a way quite distinct from the way an architect estimates spaces (Scribner 1992, Lave 1988).24 Finally, and most relevantly perhaps, verbal interaction may be seen in the same light: as a means of externalizing thinking that allows joint solutions to many problems, including the very determination of the meaning of utterances (see Clark, this volume). These approaches have in common the idea that thinking does not proceed just according to rules and exceptions, but also by more flexible on-the-spot solutions using general principles suited to the context. These ideas are referred to in a number of the papers in this volume under the rubrics of "practice," "habitus," "strategy," and so on.35
Viewed in these ways, the issue of linguistic relativity shifts significantly. From an "inner circle" of links between grammar, categories,

10

John J. Gumperz and Stephen C. Levinson

and culture as internalized by the individual, the focus shifts to include an "outer circle" of communication and its relation on the one hand to interaction in social settings and on the other hand to individual patterns of cognition which are partly contextúally attuned, and even perhaps acquired primarily through patterns of communication, in turn enabling it. Perhaps this wider perspective will help to build a bridge across the Durkheimian division that we have inherited between the psychological and social sciences.
2.3 The structure of the book
The chapters in this volume explore this series of interlocked issues. The book falls roughly into two halves: the first two sections address the classical issues of the relation between thought and language, and the extent of linguistic and cultural universals. The second two sections show how changes in our understanding of meaning require that we look at how context enters into interpretation, and how context is constituted in social interaction, and reflects properties of larger social wholes.
Part I contributes some fresh ideas about the relation of language to cognition. It seems that, despite much recent skepticism, there are indeed important language-specific effects on cognitive processing. Such claims must be hedged in various ways: perhaps the effects are confined to the process of speaking itself, not all ways of putting things imply ways of thinking, and not all thought is in a form related to language at all. Nevertheless, the debate makes it clear that we can no longer view the idea of "linguistic determinism" as a pure anachronism, not worthy of serious attention.
Part II is concerned with universals in language and culture - do these severely restrict the scope for linguistic and conceptual diversity? It seems that in some semantic domains (e.g. spatial description) where universals are expected, they nevertheless prove hard to specify or indeed to find. Yet in other conceptual domains where they are least expected (like religious ideas), they may in the end be rather self-evident. This unsettles our confidence that we know a priori how to apportion the explanation of behavior between the psychic unity of mankind and the divisive variation of culture. Nor in any case would the existence of enormously rich universals rule out extensive cultural difference at every level.
Part III explores how context and background assumptions enter into the determination of meaning and interpretation. Starting from the clear case of indexicals, the arguments tend to show that understanding is grounded in shared practice and mutual assumptions. Interpretive diversity can thus be generated independently of difference at the level of grammar and lexicon. The scope of linguistic relativity, thus construed as a question of differentiated meaning-systems, is now enormously widened.

Introduction: linguistic relativity re-examined

11

Part IV takes up this idea, and explores its consequences for how we conceive of "language" and "culture." If meaning resides in interpretive practices, and these are located in the social networks one is socialized in, then the "culture-" and "language-" bearing units are not nations, ethnic groups or the like - they are not units at all, but rather networks of interacting individuals, which can be thought of in either more or less inclusive ways.
We end up then with a reconstrual of all the terms in the classic relation of language, thought, and culture.

2.4 Taking stock: some emergent ideas and future prospects
A number of important themes emerge from the volume. First, there are diverse sources of difference and incommensurability across languages and varieties. Whorf emphasized the grammatical, because he felt the unconscious repetitive, coercive patterning on the grammatical level would be reflected in a regimentation of thinking. But in this volume many other levels of linguistic patterning are considered. It is argued that the lexical level can also have deep cognitive effects, by requiring distinctions to be noticed and memorized at the time of experience, in case the need arises for later description. Recent work shows that these effects can be demonstrated and replicated across different languages and cultures.36
Yet there are also levels of patterning beyond the grammatical and lexical, best appreciated by switching the perspective from the language producer to the language interpreter. Here there are different patterns of interpretation, which can be invoked by complex constellations of cues across linguistic and paralinguistic levels. Here we find "transpositions" to contexts distinct from, but functionally similar to, the context of speaking. Here too we find markers of stance, or attitude, through which social relationships are signalled, and subtle contextualization cues that invoke the type of activity (banter, argument, excuse-giving, etc.) within which the utterance is to be assessed.
Thus we are led into the study of the on-line complexities of utterance comprehension, and come to appreciate the miraculous co-ordination of perspectives that is required for satisfactory communication. Serious studies of interactive discourse post-date Sapir or Whorf, of course, if only because practical recording methods were not then available. These studies show recurrent patterning on the discourse level, which may be connected to patterning at the grammatical level (e.g. through the grammaticalizalion of particular expressive techniques). Some of the ideas that emerge have distinct parallels to Whorf's ideas: much of the cueing of context is done through repetitive, subliminal, and subtle cues, not accessible to introspection, and which can differ systematically across

12

cultures and social networks. Whorf was keen to establish the relation between, on the one hand, construing reality in a certain way as required by the language one speaks, and, on the other, acting in certain ways (recollect his example of the gasoline drums marked "empty/' suggesting the absence of danger and prompting carelessness with naked flame). In a similar way, utilizing interpretative strategies of particular sorts can be shown to have demonstrable consequences - these become particularly salient when speaker and addressee do not share them, and systematic miscommunication results.37
Another set of interesting ideas that emerge is the deconstruction of the notion of "culture" or "community." Communication relies on shared meanings and strategies of interpretation. However, this common ground is distributed in a complex way through social networks. Such networks may constitute effective "sub-cultures," nested communities within communities; but they can also cross-cut linguistic and social boundaries of all sorts, creating regional and even global patterns of shared, similar communicative strategies in specialist networks.
All of these ideas have to be set within the context of the everincreasing set of universal cognitive constraints that are being discovered. But the sources of meaning-difference are many, and what, seen in grammatical perspective, may seem like little discrepancies can have large and pervasive communicative effects.38 Thus neither the study of sameness nor that of difference limits the interest of the other.
Given the complexity of the issues raised, the reader will find here no new overall theory. Rather, the aims are much more modest, to introduce the reader to newly discovered, arguably relevant phenomena, to place the constellation of notions associated with linguistic relativity in the context of current theory, and thereby to enrich the original hypothesis. Nevertheless, much of the range of Whorf's interests, from semantic diversity, to cognitive processes, to the nature of culture and the constitution of society, are here reflected.

cognitive categories has generally been in the ascendant The deep influence of Aristotle's categories and Boethius's translations, together with his own views, are no doubt part of the explanation (see Marenbon 1988: ch. 3). On the other hand, the question whether the "modes of being, thinking and signifying" are necessarily in parallel, or whether the categories might be mismatched across reality, cognition, and language was a point of active medieval disputation (see Marenbon 1987:136ff.). Outside the Western tradition, one may find views reminiscent of "linguistic relativity" in, for example, early Indian philosophy, where the word was in some doctrines taken to be an arbitrary conceptual construction, and determinative of cognition and conceptual categories (see Staal 1976:121-3).
4 A point already made by Hamann in 1760; see Cloeren (1988:11-12). 5 This aspect of the Humboldtian tradition and the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis
is not fully developed in this volume. See Hill (1988) and Hill & Mannheim (1992) for recent reviews of the relevant anthropological literature.
6 Despite this, the theory of translation has not played a central role in twentieth-century thinking on the subject. See however Jakobson (1966) and Steiner (1975), and Quine's (1960) celebrated thesis of the indeterminacy of translation. There is now a burgeoning practical field of translation studies; see, e.g., Baker (1992).
7 A point made decades ago by Hymes (1964, 1972).
8 See, e.g., Kelly (1979), Steiner (1975). 9 See, e.g., Berlin (I993:ch. 6) for references; Cloeren (1988), AarslefT(1974). 10 See, e.g. Fagden (1982) for a survey of European ideas about the American
Indian, in which controversies about language difference play no small part: language was presumed to mirror social development, and the Spanish champions of the Indians like Las Casas were keen to show that the Indian languages had a systematic grammar, while their detractors tried to establish that they lacked abstractions fundamental for intellectual and spiritual development.
11 Hymes's reader (1964: Pt. Ill) collects together exemplary papers from this tradition, and is still the best source for the student.
12 Whorfhimselfpaints, beyond Sapirand Boas, a different pedigree (1956:73-8). On the Humboldtian heritage see Aarsleff (1988), Heeschen (1977, 1987), Trabant (1990), Gipper (1972), and references below. Ironically, Humboldtian scholarship seems peculiarly afflicted with the woes of translation (Kelly 1979: 27).
13 See G. Steiner (1975:74) who cites Leibniz's 1697 tract "On the amelioration and correction of German." A now largely forgotten mid eighteenth-century intellectual figure, Johann Georg Hamann, himself the teacher of Herder, preadumbrates many of Humboldt's views (Berlin 1993). Herder's own role is now controversial: Aarsleff (1982, 1988) has challenged any connection between Herder and Humboldt's views, while Mueller-Vollmer (1990:9ff.) ridicules this account of intellectual history: "Humboldt is made out to be a kind of German-speaking French ideologue rather than a student and follower of Herder, Kant or Fichte." A convincing case for a long-running and distinctively German tradition of "linguistic relativists" is made by Cloeren (1988). Such ideas were so much in the air (hat in 1757 the Berlin Academy offered a prize on the theme (see quote at head of this introduction). See also Penn (1972).

15 In turn the enlightenment discussion was fed by sixteenth- and seventeenthcentury Spanish thought prompted by encounters with New World peoples (see Pagden 1982). For the apparent paradox of the German lack of colonial experience on the one hand and their interest in these issues on the other, there was already an answer suggested by British critics of imperial cruelties in the 1830s: the Germans had no motive to belittle the intellectual achievements of distant peoples (see Boening 1990).
16 See AarslefT (1988: IxifT). 17 See Koerner (1992: 174). 18 On the origins of structuralism, see Koerner (1975), Engler (1975), Hymes &
Fought (1975). 19 Mueller-Vollmer (1990) claims that Herder, and especially Humboldt, actually
prefigured the Saussurean concept of the sign, and it is this that distinguishes the German intellectual tradition from the eighteenth-century French one. He quotes an early Humboldt text thus: "The sensory signification of those units into which certain portions of our thinking are united in order to be opposed as parts to other parts of a larger whole... is what may be called language in the widest sense of the word" (1990:17). On the Humboldlian, and more generally German, origins of strucluralism see Koerner (1975).
20 The background to that convergence is well described in Lucy (1992a: ch. 2). 21 Perhaps especially clear in European Saussurean structuralism (for example
through Saussure's metaphor of a linguistic system simultaneously dividing form and meaning like scissors cutting a sheet of paper). The surprisingly independent nature of American structuralism is described by Hymes & Fought (1975:916rT.) who state that there is no evidence that, e.g., Sapir was aware of Saussure's work.
22 Koerner (1992:181) (but the phrase was current in contemporary German philosophy at the turn of the century - see, e.g., Cloeren's 1988: 206-7 discussion of the ideas of Runze). We make no attempt here to characterize or compare Boas's or Sapir's views with those of Whorf- a concise summary may be found in Lucy (1992a: chs. 1 & 2). See also Jakobson (I944).
23 Whorf's views on the structure of language are much better articulated elsewhere; e.g. "it is not words mumbled, but RAPPORT between words, which enables them to work together at all to any semantic result" (1956:67). See especially the article "Grammatical categories" ([1945] 1956:87-101) and the surprisingly "modern" scheme for a typology of languages (1956:125-33).
24 There has always been considerable disagreement about what Whorf "really meant." Some (e.g. Lucy 1922a) think this can be spelt out as a clear, testable doctrine; others (e.g. Schultz 1990) hold that there has been a systematic suppression of Whorf's mystical views and a failure to recognize that the texts through their very ambiguities and implicit implications articulate a protest against "epistemológicaI monomania."
25 See also selected papers in Hymes (1964: pt. III). 26 This was not necessarily the intention of that work, which was merely to
establish perceptual constraints on linguistic coding. In fact Kay & Kempton (1984) demonstrated that differential linguistic coding of colors does indeed effect perceptual judgments. 27 See e.g. Rosch (1977), on the general theory and Maloiki (1983) on Whorf's Hopi data. Many critiques have only a tenuous relation to ideas that Whorf

himself advanced, as in the case of "the great Eskimo vocabulary hoax" (Pul) urn 1991, see Martin 1986 for a more sober view). See also Lucy (1985,1992a: ch. 2). 28 But see Silverstein's (1981) insistence that we have differential conscious access to different aspects of grammatical structure, a point taken up in some of the papers in this volume. Jakobson (1944) pointed out that the linguist's own categories of analysis are likely to reflect encodings in his own language.
29 Kamp (1981). 30 Barwise & Perry (1983). 31 Sperber & Wilson (1986). 32 See Levinson (1983: ch. 3), Horn (1989). 33 There is an enormous literature on the notion of indexicalily, bul useful
reference can be made to Jarvella & Klein (1982) for the notions current in much linguistics, philosophy, and psychology, and to Meriz & Parmentier (1985) for the related but distinct Peircean notions, especially in linguistic anthropology.
34 Yet another line of thought investigates how a single task can be solved by distribution over a co-ordinated team: for example, the piloting of a ship involves single seamen each following highly specific procedures (Hutchins 1990).
35 Bourdieu (1976, 1990a: ch. 3, 1990b: ch. 3), Scribner (1992), and Lave (1988) have been influential in purveying these ideas in anthropology. Some of these ideas come originally from the work of Vygotsky; for a compendium of recent views on the implications for language, thought, and culture, see Wertsch (1985).
36 See e.g. Brown & Levinson (1993), Pederson (1995). 37 See Gumperz (1992), Young (1994).
38 See Young (1994) for an illustration of how ideologies of interpersonal relations, grammar, and contextualization strategies interact in communication, and tend to reinforce stereotypes.

LINGUISTIC DETERMINISM: THE INTERFACE BETWEEN LANGUAGE AND THOUGHT

INTRODUCTION TO PART I
JOHN J. GUMPERZ AND STEPHEN C. LEVINSON
Language is the formative organ of thought. Intellectual activity, entirely mental, entirely internal, and to some extent passing without trace, becomes through sound, externalized in speech and perceptible to the senses. Thought and language are therefore one and inseparable from each other.
Humboldt ([1836] 1988:54)
Human beings do not live in the objective world alone,. .. The fact of the matter is that the "real world" is to a large extent unconsciously built up on the language habits of the group... We see and hear and otherwise experience very largely as we do because the language habits of our community predispose certain choices of interpretation.
Edward Sapir, quoted at the head of Whorf "The relation of habitual thought and behavior to language." (1956:134)
1 The very idea: causal links between language and thinking
Might the language we speak eñect the way we think? Generations of thinkers have been intrigued by this idea. Aarsleff (1988: xviii) summarized Humboldt's influential views thus: "Humboldt's entire view of the nature of language is founded on the conviction that thinking and speaking, thought and language form so close a union that we must think of them as being identical, in spite of the fact that we can separate them artificially. Owing to this identity, access to one of the two will open nearly equal access to the other."1
Whorf, as we saw in the introduction, brought to the idea a new and heady mix of an empiricist epistemology, an insistence on the underlying systematicity of language as a structured semantical system, and an emphasis on the unconscious influence of language on habitual thought:2
Actually, thinking is most mysterious, and by far the greatest light upon it that we have is thrown by the study of language. This study shows that the forms of a person's thoughts are controlled by inexorable laws of pattern of which he is unconscious. These patterns are the unperceived intricate systematizations of his own language - shown readily enough by a candid comparison and contrast with other languages, especially those of a different linguistic family. His thinking itself is in a language - in English, in Sanskrit, in Chinese. And every language is a vast pattern-system, different from others, in which are culturally ordained the
21

forms and categories by which the personality not only communicates, but also analyzes nature, notices or neglects types of relationship and phenomena, channels his reasoning, and builds the house of his consciousness.
(Whorf 1956:252)
The phrase "linguistic determinism" has come to stand for these views that there is a causal influence from linguistic patterning to cognition.3 Despite phrases like "linguistic conditioning," "linguistic legislation," "inexorable control," etc., Whorf's own considered position seems to have been that language influences unconscious habitual thought, rather than limiting thought potential (see Lucy 1992a: 129ff., Kay & Kempton 1984:76-7).4 Thus the phrase "linguistic determinism" should be understood to imply thai there is at least some causal influence from language categories to non-verbal cognition; it was not intended to denote an exclusive causal vector in one direction - probably no proponent has held the view that what cannot be said cannot be thought.5
The idea that language could determine (however weakly) the nature of our thinking nowadays carries more than a faint whiff of anachronism; rather it seems to belong to an altogether different age, prior to the serious study of mind as an information processing device.6 That device, in the predominant metaphor of our time, is instantiated in "wetware," whose properties are in turn dictated by the genetic code of the species. Although those properties are only dimly understood, still it is generally presumed, as Fodor (1983) has influentially put it, that the mind is "modular," composed of subsystems specialized to the automatic unconscious processing of particular kinds of information, visual, auditory, haptic, and so on. Since we can, for example, talk about what we see, the output of these specialized systems must, it seems, be available to some central information processing system, where "thinking," in the sense of ratiocination and deliberation, occurs. This picture (a close analogy of course to the computers of the day) of a single generalized central processor with specialized input/output devices is beginning to give way to a more complex version: each specialized input/ output device is itself a system of modules, while "central processes" may themselves be differentiated into different "languages of thought" (propositional, imagistic, and so on)7 - a view that the paper by Keller & Keller in this section addresses. Nevertheless the essentials of the Fodorean view are very generally held.
Thus, on this widespread view, we can expect thinking in all essentials to have universal properlies, to be couched in an inner language slructurally the same for all members of the species, and to be quite unrelated to the facts of linguistic diversity (see, e.g., Fodor 1983). The tenor of the anli-Whorfian assumptions can be gauged from the following quotations: "For the vocabulary of the language, in and of its self, to be a

moulder of thought, lexical dissections and categorizations of nature would have to be almost accidentally formed, rather as though some Johnny Appleseed had scattered named categories capriciously over the earth" (Rosch 1977: 519); "Whorf *s hypothesis [of linguistic determinism] has engendered much confusion, and many circular arguments. Its converse often seems more plausible" (Wason & Johnson-Laird 1977:411), and "there is no evidence for the strong version of the hypothesis - that language imposes upon its speakers a particular way of thinking about the world" (p. 442); "The discussions that assume that language determines thought carry on only by a collective suspension of disbelief" (Pinker 1994:58).
In short, many authors find the thesis of linguistic determinism wildly adventurous or even ridiculous. On the other hand, others have recently claimed to find it sober and plausible (amongst them Steiner 1975, Lee 1991, Lucy 1992a, b, together with some other contributors to this volume). It is therefore useful to attempt to clarify the issues by dissecting the relativity hypothesis into its component parts, and in particular by isolating the "determinism" hypothesis from other linked ideas. Clearly, the hypothesis of linguistic relativity relies on the presumption of linguistic difference. Thus the discovery of universals may have a bearing on that hypothesis.8 But the hypothesis that linguistic categories might determine aspects of non-linguistic thinking is quite independent of facts about linguistic difference. Let us therefore spell out the nexus of interlinked hypotheses (where the numbers [1] and [2] refer to the premises and the number [3] to an implied conclusion).10
[1] Linguistic difference Languages differ substantially in their semantic structure: both the intensions (the senses) and extensions (the denotations) of lexical and morpho-syntactic categories may differ across languages (and may do so independently).l'
[2] Linguistic determinism Linguistic categorizations, implicit or explicit, may determine or codetermine or influence aspects of non-linguistic categorization, memory, perception or thinking in general.
This is often said to have a "strong" and a "weak" form: under the strong claim, linguistically uncoded concepts would be unattainable; under the weak form, concepts which happen to be linguistically coded would be facilitated or favored (e.g. would be more accessible, easier to remember, or the default coding for non-linguistic cognition).12

The mechanisms whereby semantic distinctions may have an influence on cognition can be left open; a prior task is to show that there is indeed

some correlation. Whorf himself of course held the view that the unconscious "compulsive patterning" of grammatical oppositions would play a special role in habitual unreflective patterns of thought.13

Linguistic relativity Given that: (1) differences exist in linguistic categories across languages; (2) linguistic categories determine aspects of individuals' thinking;
then: (3) aspects of individuals' thinking differ across linguistic communities according to the language they speak.
Note that the conclusion here will hold even under the weakest versions of (1) and (2). Thus if there is at least some aspect of semantic structure that is not universal, and at least some cognitive effect of such distinctive semantic properties, then there must be at least some systematic cognitive variation in line with linguistic difference. That would seem, as Lucy (1992a: 3) puts it, to be as trivially true as the strongest version of linguistic relativity (that one's semantic inventory of concepts provides one's total vocabulary of thoughts) is trivially false."1 Thus the central problem is to illuminate the degrees of language difference, and the ways in which semantics and cognitive categories and processes interact.
Now notice that modern views complicate this picture by apparently subscribing to various aspects of these propositions while robustly denying the conclusion in the syllogism above. For example, a common modern stance is:
(V) languages differ in semantic structure, but only at a molecular level - at an atomic level, the conceptual "atoms" (e.g. "male," "adult," etc.) are identical, and are merely assembled into some culture-specific notion like"uncle";15 (2') "determinism" between semantic categories and conceptual categories is in a sense trivially complete, since they are one and the same the meanings of words are expressed in a "language" that is identical to the "language of thought." However, the directionality of the determinism runs from universal cognition to linguistic semantics (Jackendoif 1983, Lakoff 1987, Hale & Keyser 1987).
Thus although the identity of linguistic and conceptual categories in (2') alone might be thought to entail linguistic relativity, it is in fact usually associated with some claim (often implicit) like that in (1'), allowing subscribers to presume that the Vlanguage of thought" (alias: system of semantic representations) is universal. Then the conclusion in

(3) no longer follows. In schematic form we may now oppose the two views thus:

The Whorfian syllogism
(1) Different languages utilize different semantic representation systems which are informationally non-equivalent16 (at least in the sense thai they employ different lexical concepts); (2) semantic representations determine aspects of conceptual representations; therefore (3) users of different languages utilize different conceptual representations.
The anti-Whorfian syllogism
(1') Different languages utilize the same semantic representation system (if not at the molecular then at least at the atomic level of semantic primes); (20 universal conceptual representations determine semantic systems, indeed THE semantic representation system just is identical to THE propositional conceptual system (the innate "language of thought"); there/ore (3') users of different languages utilize the identical conceptual representation system.
Despite the fact that the doctrines appear diametrically opposed,17 they are nevertheless, on suitable interpretations, entirely compatible, as long as one subscribes to the distinction between atomic and molecular levels of semantic representation. Then, on an atomic level, semantic representations, and their corresponding conceptual representations, are drawn from a universal language of thought, while on the molecular level there are language-specific combinations of universal atomic primitives, which make up lexical meanings (and meanings associated with morpho-syntactic distinctions) and which may have specific conceptual effects.
Most semantic analysts in practice work with an assumption of such "semantic decomposition" of linguistic expressions.>s But it is worth pointing out that there are in fact fundamental problems with that assumption which have long been recognized (Kempson 1977; Fodor 1975; Fodor, Fodor &. Garrett 1975; Putnam 1988:5ff.), and some of those who subscribe enthusiastically to (2') might lose some of their enthusiasm if they realized that without (1'), (2') implies the strongest version of linguistic relativity.19
Let us take slock. Proposition (1) is evidently true, in the sense that languages clearly employ distinct lexical meanings. (1') may or may not

26

John J. Gumperz and Stephen C. Levinson

be tenable, but is in tact compatible with (1). Likewise (2) and (2') are compatible if we make a distinction between atomic and molecular concepts: the inventory of concepts in the language of thought could determine the range of possible lexical concepts, but such lexical concepts once selected could in turn determine the concepts we employ when solving non-linguistic problems. (3) would be the conclusion from (1) and (2). All thus hinges on (2). Is it even remotely plausible?
Although the thesis of linguistic determinism seems at first sight to have an anachronistic flavor, it can easily be brought to bear on modern theorizing in a way that makes it look anything but silly. First, note that there is considerable psychological evidence that our working memory is restricted to about half a dozen chunks of information, but is indifferent to the underlying complexity of those chunks (Miller 1956, Simon 1986). Thus mental operations are facilitated by grouping elementary concepts into larger chunks. And this is just what lexical items do for us. Thus there is every reason to think that such chunks might play an important role in our thinking (Fodor, Fodor & Garrett 1975; Fodor 1992:389).20
Now consider Levelt's (1989) theory of speech production, a synthesis of a large amount of current theory, fact, and speculation. In this theory, the thought-stream is coded in language essentially by matching chunks of conceptual structure with lexical specifications of meaning, further lexical information then driving grammatical and phonological encoding. In order for this encoding process to begin, the speaker must regiment the conceptual structure so that it matches semantic specifications in the lexicon: if there is no match, the thoughts cannot be coded. This regimentation process might be called "thinking for speaking" (see Slobin's chapter below) and must consist of habits learnt during language acquisition.2'
Within such a framework, it is quite easy to show that in certain respects and for certain phenomena linguistic determinism beyond Ihinking-for-speaking is not only plausible, but must be correct. The reasoning can be exemplified as follows. Consider a language that has no words for *in front? 'behind, 'left? 'right,' and so on, preferring instead to designate all such relations, however microscopic in scale, in terms of notions like 'North,' 'South,' 'East,' 'West,' etc. Now a speaker of such a language cannot remember arrays of objects in the same way as you or I, in terms of their relative location from a particular viewing angle. If I think of the visual array currently in front of me, I think of it as, say, "boy in front of tree, dog to left of tree." Later I can so describe it. But that will not do for the speaker of the language with 'Norlh'/'South'/ 'East'/'West' notions: remembering the array in terms of notions like 'front' and 'left' will not allow him to reconstruct the cardinal directions. So if he remembers it that way, he will not be able to describe it later;

Introduction to part I

27

while if he remembers the array in a way congruent with the linguistic coding (in terms of'North' and 'East,' etc.), then he will be able to code it linguistically. So it seems prima facie quite clear that the speaker of such a language and I simply MUST code our experiences differently for memory in order to speak our different languages. In short, thinking in a special way for speaking will not be enough: we must mentally encode experiences in such a way that we can describe them later, in the terms required by our language.
There are in fact just such languages that require the use of cardinal directions (Levinson 1992, Haviland 1993; and chapters 6 & 9 of this volume). Furthermore, this prima facie argument about the cognitive consequences of speaking such different languages can be backed up by empirical investigation: it turns out that in non-linguistic tasks speakers of languages that use 'North'/'SouthV'EastV'West* systems instead of *front*/ 'backV'left'/'right* systems do indeed remember spatial arrays differently, in ways that can be demonstrated experimentally and observationally (see Levinson 1992, Haviland 1993, Brown & Levinson 1993).
Is this a peculiar case? One needs to think afresh to assess the possibilities. From the perspective of speech production, there are three different kinds of ways in which a particular language might determine how we think.22 First, the grammatical or lexical categories may force a specific way of thinking at the time of speaking (the "regimentation" of thoughts described above). Second, such thinking-for-speaking may itself require the coding of situations in specific forms at the time that they are experienced. This is clearly so in the North/South/East/West case above. It is also clearly so in many other cases: for example, obligatory coding of number in languages with plural marking will require noticing for all possible referents whether or not they are singletons-some languages without plural marking will let one say in effect "I saw bird on the lawn," but in English I must say either a bird or birds and must therefore have remembered how many relevant birds there were (see Lucy 1992b, and ch. 1 below); or in systems of honorifics based on relative age, I must have ascertained before speaking whether the referent is senior or junior to me; or in systems of aspect requiring distinctions between perfective and imperfective, I must attend to the exact nature of event-overlap (see Slobin, ch. 3 below). These are language-specific distinctions that seem to require noticing special properties of the world so that one is ready to encode them linguistically should the need arise. Such examples suggest that those theorists who reluctantly subscribe to a relativity in thinkingfor-speaking, will have also to subscribe to a consequent relativity in thinking at the time at which events are experienced. Thirdly, one may also go on to consider the consequences, or after-effects, of thinking-forspeaking in a particular way. There may for example be memory effects:

28

John J. Gumperz and Stephen C. Levinson

it may be easier to remember aspects of events that have been coded for speaking during prior verbalization (hence we may indulge in speakingfor-thinking). Since some languages will enforce particular codings (e.g. in systems of aspect, honorifics, number-marking, etc.), they may ensure that their speakers recall certain features of situations better than others.
At the time of writing, there has been little systematic investigation of any of these possible cognitive effects of semantic categories peculiar to, and recurrent in, specific languages.23 Meanwhile, the chapters in this section explore the thesis of the linguistic determinism of thought from a variety of theoretical and empirical angles. Two of them (those by Kay, and Keller & Keller) are downright skeptical of any such thesis or of its importance, for very different reasons. Two of them are much more sympathetic: one of these (by Slobin) is skeptical of any effects beyond the moment of speaking, the other (by Lucy) assumes that such effects can be empirically demonstrated.

2 The chapters
The chapter by Lucy introduces many of the themes of this volume beyond the issue of the linguistic determinism of thought; for example, he considers narrow vs. wide construals of linguistic relativity, and the different ways in which structure and usage are intertwined. He also provides a useful summary of earlier relevant work.
First, he makes the important point that attitudes to notions of linguistic relativity depend crucially on opinions about the nature of thought without language (see the Kellers' chapter below, and also Weiskrantz 1988). If language is thought of simply as a sort of late evolutionary appendage, a mere transducer or input-output device, with cognition essentially independent, then linguistic relativity will not even be entertained. There is no doubt that a great deal of thinking in the cognitive sciences goes in this direction. If, on the other hand, language is viewed as a uniquely arbitrary symbolic system, which is transformative of internal mental operations, being largely responsible for the specific features of cognition unique to humans, then linguistic relativity has to be taken seriously. For the very arbitrariness of language implies (a) diversity across human groups, (b) cultural transmission.
Lucy goes on to review the existing work on the classic version of the linguistic relativity hypothesis, which holds that the structural diversity of languages implies semantic incommensurability, which is in turn linked to cognitive difference (see also Lucy 1992a for monographic treatment). He points out that there has been very little serious empirical work that meets certain minimal requirements: (a) cdtitrastive linguistic analysis of two or more languages, where (b) a grammatical or major lexical pattern

29

is investigated, and where (c) there are language-independent explorations of relevant aspects of cognition. Previous work on linguistic relativity by anthropological linguists has failed to tie linguistic difference into cognition, while the work of psychologists has failed to pay serious attention to linguistic difference, and recent universalist trends have discouraged interest in the whole problem. He outlines his work, more fully described in Lucy (1992b) (see also the work of Levinson 1992; in press (a), (b); and colleagues; and pari II below).
Lucy then turns to consider a broader perspective on linguistic relativity that takes into account a relativity in use of language (a perspective championed originally by Hymes 1964). He raises the point that differences in use may be caused by structural differences, which are themselves then in turn considerably amplified through use, a thesis given exemplification by the work of Slobin (see ch. 3 below). He goes on to classify different kinds of function according to a Jakobsonian scheme ("referential," "expressive," "metalinguistic," etc.), and discusses how on each of these levels different patterns of use might engender both cultural and cognitive differences. For example, the elaboration of referential functions involved in schooling seems to have transformative effects in traditional societies. Finally, he reminds us that many authors, including other contributors to this volume, have held that these functional differences may feed back into the elaboration of structural differences, so that, for example, an "elaborated code" (Bernstein 1964) or elite mode of talk and style of conceptual analysis may control access to social strata and contribute to an ideological set of cognitive predispositions. Lucy's paper therefore bridges the current section and the last section of this book, where the relation of differences of use to the structure of speech communities is discussed.
The chapter by Slobin focuses directly on the classic issue of "linguistic determinism": can we argue that a particular language determines the way we think? Slobin recasts the problem in some fundamentally new ways. First, he advocates abandoning the original terms of discussion: let us talk not in terms of static wholes like "language" and "thought," but in terms of the relation between grammatical categories and the on-line process of converting thoughts into words - thinking for speaking. Secondly, from this perspective, he suggests that the conservative Boasian view that languages selectively encode features of shared perception may be too weak: grammatical categories may force the encoding of features that have to be actively construed or constructed. Thirdly, he argues that during the process of thinking for speaking our attention is directed by obligatory grammatical categories to certain perceptual features or to certain ways of construing scenes, with the result that the structural features of a language are projected into a specific rhetorical or narrative

30

John J. Gumperz and Stephen C. Levinson

style. This projection from the grammar into features of discourse is not strictly determinative: speakers may and do on occasion use the full resources of the language to express features thai the grammar does not require. In that respect, he rejects a strong version of determinism, which he associates with Whorf (but cf. Lucy 1992a: 40fT.). Nevertheless, as a genera] rule, features of a scene that the grammar does not code through obligatory categories are often left unsaid, and presumably may actually not be attended to during the process of thinking for speaking.
Slobin tests these claims on the basis of a comparative study of children's narrative retellings in several languages, elicited by means of a picture-story book without words. The narratives produced show that on the whole, speakers do adopt a rhetorical style in line with the language, so that, for example, if a language (like Hebrew or German) makes no contrast between a perfective and imperfective aspect, then two events that would be so distinguished in other languages are not distinguished in any other way either, for example, by repetition of the predicate to indicate durativity. However, the exceptions are important: sometimes speakers do make the contrasts that are not encouraged by grammatical means. This allows Slobin to explore the gradual acquisition by children of a rhetorical style in line with the grammar of the language, suggesting that they gradually learn to selectively attend and disattend to construals of a scene during the particular mental process of thinking for speaking.
Kay casts a skeptical eye on the thesis of linguistic relativity. He asks what kind of inference about the nature of thought we can make from the use of certain expressions: we call the familiar tool a "screwdriver," but the German word glosses as 'screw-puller' - Kay is not inclined to conclude that the tool is conceived differently from this evidence alone, but suggests that other scholars may be so inclined. Such scholars, he argues, should consider the fact that within the same language we often find two or more expressions that offer contrastive ways of construing the same facts. He oners four such cases, where English expressions seem lo presuppose completely incompatible schemata for the very same situation. In one of these cases, he argues that the hedges strictly speaking and technically speaking presuppose incompatible views about the nature of reference. In another he argues that the different perspectives encoded in John bought the car from Harry and Harry sold the car to John require, given the systematic patterns of English grammar, seeing just one party as the agent or active party in the exchange. These different schemata within a language can hardly be indicative of essential conceptual patterns, as they are mutually conflicting. Further, they make comparison between languages complex: Whorf's contrasts between English and Hopi often select just one English construal of the situation, ignoring another which parallels the Hopi one.

31

Thus Kay challenges the thesis of linguistic relativity with a reductio ad absurdum: if one argues from the conceptual schemata encoded in the expressions of language to ways of thinking typical of its speakers, one must concede that speakers of a single language hold incompatible, inconsistent conceptualizations of the world. It is preferable instead to think of languages as offering us a variety of different conceptualizations which speakers may choose between, thus decoupling linguistic schema tiza tions from thinking. Not all languages offer the same variety, but the import of that mismatch is not clear. Kay's cautionary remarks show that the would-be relativist must consider the full range of alternative expressions in any language, and consider how to make the argument from linguistic encoding to patterns of thinking given that full range. Two ideas are relevant here: one is the notion of "conventional perspective" introduced by Clark in part III, and another is Whorf's insistence that il is only the repetitive use of a predominant linguistic pattern that one might expect to influence "habitual thought."
As suggested by Lucy, another way to conceive of the problem of linguistic determinism is to think about thought without language. Most theorists subscribe to the idea that there is a kind of prepositional thought closely bound up with language; some hold that this kind of thought determines the nature of semantic representations, while a minority may hold that the causal influence is in reverse. But what is there left if we subtract this kind of cognition?
Whorf's version of the thesis of linguistic determinism was formulated in an era when the psychological sciences conceived of thinking as a unified kind of process. Today, the prevailing assumption is of the "modularity of mind" (to use Fodor's [1983] phrase), wherein it is assumed that there are many distinct "modules" or information processors, each specialized to certain kinds of information: thus there may be visual processors, specialized processors of linguistic signals, specialized devices controlling motor movements, etc. These modules govern the processing of perception and motor output; perhaps the corresponding thinking is similarly divided. Keller & Keller subscribe to this widely held modern view, citing phylogenetic, ontogenetic, and neurophysiological evidence in its favour. Even some theories of linguistic semantics point to the priority of imagistic ways of thinking. What, they ask, remains of the thesis of linguistic determinism given such a view?
Keller & Keller focus on the kind of thinking involved in productive activity. Ethnographic observations of an American blacksmith confirm that production is guided by image not by the proposiUonal forms of information that are thought to He behind linguistic meaning. Thus even when linguistic input is used in design, the words seem to tie into a nonpropositional way of thinking. The study of such verbal interaction, for

32

John J. Gumperz and Stephen C. Levinson

example, between smith and client, seems to show that complex information is successfully and efficiently conveyed through the use of expressions that are propositionally vague, but serve to evoke relatively precise mental images.
Keller & Keller conclude that there seem to be distinct kinds of thought, quite largely independent, so that at most the thesis of linguistic determinism would be a thesis about the relation of language to just that part of the cognitive system specialized to propositional representations. At the very least, the whole thesis of linguistic relativity needs to be reconslrued in a modular theory of mind.

Notes
1 Humboldt's views here probably had in part a French origin, as mentioned in the introduction, cf. e.g.: "If speech is a thought that manifests itself, it must also be true that thought is interior and hidden speech" (Antoine de Riva rol, 1784, piscours sur Tuniversalité de la langue francaise, quoted in AarslefT 1988: xliv).
2 For a careful explication and clarification (indeed extension) of Whorf's ideas here, see Lucy (1992a: ch. 2).
3 A prior thing to establish, one might think, is whether indeed there are any substantial cross-cultural d i (Terences in cognition. Anthropologists on the whole tacitly seem to suppose that there are, and then concern themselves with what exactly constitutes the difference between "us" and "them," finding it, for example, in mythic thought (Lévi-Strauss 1966), or literacy (Goody 1977), or levels of psychic development (Hallpike 1979). There isa discipline charged with this task, cross-cultural psychology (see Triandis & Berry 1980), but curiously this has played hardly any role in the linguistic relativity debate (but see Cole & Scribner 1977).
4 Cf. Schultz (1990:10-15) who argues that some of the more extreme statements have been systematically excluded from the Whorfian canon.
5 Searle's (1969:19-20) principle of expressibility comes close: "anything that can be meant [communicatively intended], can be said." The contrapositive is "anything that cannot be said cannot be meant."
6 For the history of the rise of the cognitive sciences, see Gardner (1985), Hirst (1988).
7 See, e.g., Jackendoff (1992). 8 The relation of universals to relativity is discussed by Gellner (1988) in an
interesting way: he holds that relativity is essentially the claim that there is NOT just one world "out there," a doctrine that science has proved to be false, on the other hand science is a peculiar mode of thought that has occurred just once in cultural traditions, and is by no means universal. Universals of thought and relativity are thus on this account orthogonal issues.
9 In fact some research on the hypothesis of linguistic determinism has been conducted by the intra-language study of whether having linguistic labels for denotata makes them more easily or accurately memorable (e.g. Brown &. Lenneberg 1954).

10 For another attempt to spell out the Whorfian syllogism, see Kay & Kemplon (1984) (drawing on earlier distillations by Eric Lenneberg and Roger Brown). For a detailed discussion of the relation between conceptual structure and linguistic categories in contemporary linguistics and philosophy, see Levinson (in press [a]).
11 For example, our concept of "fish" and their concept of "fish" could be identical, but the extension of theirs could be larger (they might think porpoises are fish); or the extension of their term X and our term "planets" might be identical, while the intensions are contrastive (e.g. their intension of X might be "wandering star").
12 The "strong" form, though, is almost certainly a straw man, since it is unclear that anyone ever held it, despite the fact that the "weak" form is "not the one usually given, and is certainly not what most anthropology students are taught as 'The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis'" (Kay & Kemplon 1984:77). The latter authors point out that Whorf definitely presumed a level of languageindependent cognition (see also documentation in Lucy 1992a: 38-45). Some commentators on Whorf claim that Whorf *s own position on the "strong" vs. "weak'* determinacy issue was equivocal (Schultz 1990:14-15). Still, there is little doubt that much anti-Whorf sentiment (e.g. Pinker 1994: ch. 3, Pullum 1991) is directed at a mythical target.
13 We can take this in part to be a concomitant of the behaviorist era in which he was writing. Some modern sympathizers hold on to some notion of habituation as a causal mechanism in linguistic determinism (Lucy 1992b); see also the more guarded views of Slobin (this volume). We sketch below a different possible argument: if one is to speak a language which makes certain distinctions obligatory, one simply must have categorized experience in appropriate ways (i.e., have noticed how stales or events were structured on the relevant parameters).
14 That some effects of linguistic coding on conceptualization are to be found is not denied by the strongest opponents of the determinacy hypothesis - see e.g. Fodor (1992:389), Pinker (1994:65).
15 Explicitly advanced by Katz & Fodor (1963), still adopted by e.g. Jackendoff (1990: 37ff.), despite the difficulties spelt out in, e.g., Kempson (1977:96fT.).
16 Thus sentences of the one language may be said to be untranslatable into sentences of the other, in the sense that information may simply be lacking: consider the question whether "You are right" in English should be translated with a tu or a vous in French.
17 They are of course opposed in intention: the anli-Whorñan hypothesis, with some adjustments (e.g. the conclusion exchanged for the first premise), is intended to explain semantic universa Is (see, e.g., Clark & Clark 1977):
(1') users of different languages utilize the identical conceptual system; (2') the conceptual system (the innate "language of thought") determines the semantic representation system; there/ore (3') speakers of different languages utilize the same or similar semantic representation systems, hence there are significant semantic universals.
18 They know, of course, that for most purposes such an analysis is equivalent to one employing unanalyzable primitives with their "components" spelt out by meaning postulates (see e.g. Lyons 1982:93f.; for different views about the psychological plausibility of these two solutions see Chierchia & McConnellGinet 1990: ch.8, and Bierwisch & Schreuder 1993).

19 True, one might still escape the relativist conclusion, by desperately adopting (1") instead of (1) (as Fodor 1975 does):
(]") evolution foresaw our need for notions like logarithm, symphony, laser, hologram, etc., and so provided the relevant underlying concepts as unanalyzable conceptual wholes (and so on for every other apparently culture-specific notion).
This looks like an obvious reductio ad absurdum; for discussion, see e.g. Putnam (1988: ch. I), and Sterelny (1990). 20 Curiously, many commentators think this could not be the kind of thing Whorf had in mind: "the argument for an important linguistic relativity evaporates under scrutiny. The only respect in which language clearly and obviously does influence thought turns out to be rather banal: language provides us with most of our concepts" (Devitt & Sterelny 1987:178); "most of the experiments have tested banal 'weak* versions of the Whorfian hypothesis, namely (hat words can have some effect on memory or categorization. Some of the experiments have worked, but that is hardly surprising" (Pinker 1994: 65). The concessions hardly seem banal!
21 Many nativists find this kind of linguistic determinism quite acceptable, e.g. Pinker (1989:360) states "Whorf was surely wrong when he said that one's language determines how one conceptualizes reality in general. But he was probably correct in a much weaker sense: one's language does determine how one must conceptualize reality when one has to talk about il." But it may not be possible to clearly distinguish thinking for speaking from just plain thinking - see below.
22 These paragraphs owe much to seminar discussions at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics with Pirn Levelt, Dan Slobin, and John Lucy.
23 The existing body of research is very small: see Kay & Kempton (1984), the review in Lucy (1992a), Lucy's own studies in Lucy (1992b), and the work of the Cognitive Anthropology Research group at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics, exemplified in, e.g.. Brown & Levinson (1993).

THE SCOPE OF LINGUISTIC RELATIVITY: AN ANALYSIS AND REVIEW OF EMPIRICAL RESEARCH
JOHN A. LUCY
1 Introduction
The possibility that the Language we speak influences the way we think has excited both popular and scientific imagination in the West for well over a century (Lucy 1985a, Aarsleff 1982). Rigorous demonstration of such influences would have profound implications not only for the scientific understanding of human life but also for the conduct of research and public policy. Yet this intense interest and manifest significance have not led to a commensurate volume and quality of empirical research. We still know little about the connections between particular language patterns and mental life - let alone how they operate or how significant they are.
On the one hand, a mere handful of empirical studies address the linguistic relativity proposal directly and nearly all are conceptually flawed in very fundamental ways. Common defects in existing research include working within a single language, privileging the categories of one language or culture in comparative studies, dealing with a relatively marginal aspect of language (e.g. a small set of lexical items), and failing to provide direct evidence regarding individual cognition. On the other hand, both speculation and research have focused rather narrowly on possible links between particular language structures and some measure of cognitive outcome and have ignored two important facets of the problem that must be treated in any full account. A full account must identify the properties of natural language which make diversity possible and give it a crucial role in cultural life. These properties and their consequences will form the cornerstone of any theory about the processes (or mechanisms) underlying the language-thought linkage and indicate exactly where diversity should have effects. A full account must also examine to what extent culturally specific patterns of use - both beliefs and practices - mediate the impact of language structure on thought or have their own direct effects independent of structural type. Understanding the cultural uses of language is essential not only for assessing the particular significance of given structural effects both within and
37

across cultures but also for assessing the general significance of language in social and psychological life. In short, empirical research on the linguistic relativity proposal must rectify the existing conceptual problems while expanding the scope of inquiry to include questions about underlying mechanism and cultural significance.
The present chapter reviews existing empirical research on linguistic relativity within such a broadened framework. The first section briefly sketches the implications of having a natural language or not. The discussion indicates that languages are distinctive, in contrast to other semiotic forms, in having a central symbolic component, and that this property both enables language diversity and holds specific implications for the relation of language and thought. The second section reviews in detail empirical research aimed at assessing the implications of having one language as opposed to another, that is, the classic linguistic relativity proposal that structural differences among languages in their categories of meaning have an impact on thought. The discussion indicates some of the reasons for the paucity of empirical research, analyzes the contributions and limitations of previous work, and describes my own recent efforts to improve research in this area. The third section outlines the significance of diversity in the discursive (or cultural) functions of language for actions in and conceptions of the world. The discussion clarifies the role of patterns of use in mediating structural relativity, suggests that variation in usage might have effects in its own right, and provides a framework for and examples of research suggestive of such effects for both the referential and expressive qualities of language. A fourth and final section discusses how linguistic structure and discursive function interact dialectically in conjunction with language ideologies and how such interactions create problems for the research process itself.

2 Semiotic relativity
Attempts to address the question of the significance of language differences for thought must begin with a consideration of the general role and significance of language in human life. Biologists and psychologists have long speculated on the very diverse worlds available to various species by virtue of the disparate sensory stimuli to which they are sensitive and the different neural capacities for organizing, storing, and manipulating such sensory input. As the only species with language, the human perspective on the world may differ not only in terms of such physical characteristics, but also as a function of the availability and use of this qualitatively different semiotic forrii. That is, in the human case, it is important to ask whether the use of the semiotic form we call language

39

in and of itself fundamentally alters the vision of the world held by humans in contrast to other species. We can call this the hypothesis of semiotic relativity. Although research on the general role of language in human life and thought cannot be reviewed here, it is essential to introduce this perspective into the discussion because the evaluation of the linguistic relativity issue depends greatly on the position one first takes on the implications of having a language at all versus not having one, and then on what features of natural language are regarded as most relevant to thought.
One common view stresses the continuities of human psychology and social organization with that of other species and sees the transformative power oí language as very limited. If there are differences in thought between humans and other species, they stem directly from neurocognitive differences in the brain, not from the system of symbolic signs which they make possible. Those adopting this perspective tend to see experience as a direct function of perception and cognition operating without language, to regard speech itself as a biological phenomenon with a specific localizable organic base, and to view language as a mere encoding of prior experience so that it may be relayed to others. A large amount of research in the social sciences, especially within the cognitive sciences, operates as if language had such an unproblematic "mapping" relationship to perception, cognition, emotion, social interaction, etc.
Another view, the one adopted here, is that the human sciences are fundamentally distinct from the physical and life sciences precisely because they attempt to encompass a new order of regularity closely associated with the use of the symbolic medium of natural language. This new medium not only adds a new level of regularity, it also transforms existing levels. Thus, where biologists operate with units such as individual organism and social group, the human sciences also explore questions of self and culture, the nature of reflective consciousness, and the significance of historically developed systems of meaning. All of the latter depend centrally on language. Further, the cultural creation of new technologies can neutralize the limits in our biological inheritance by augmenting our perceptual, intellectual, and physical powers, and this, in turn, makes our symbolic world relatively more important. Overall, the new order of diversity and regularity characterizing human life requires new approaches to supplement those of the other sciences.
Ultimately, then, an evaluation of the role of language-in-general in human thought constitutes a necessary component of any research on linguistic relativity. Such research must be informed by a semiotic perspective, that is, a perspective which clarines the distinctive qualities of natural language in contrast to other semiotic forms and the relationship of those qualities to psychological and social life. From such a semiotic

40

John A. Lucy

point of view, the distinguishing feature of natural language is its central symbolic component. The more specific distinguishing characteristics of human language inventoried in various accounts (e.g. Hockett 1958) all ultimately depend on or stem directly from this feature. Following Peirce (1932; see also Benveniste [1939] 1971 and Piagel 1973), a symbolic sign involves a sign vehicle which stands for some object only by virtue of being so taken to stand for it by an interpretant. In other words, the sign-object relationship is established conventionally in a social group rather than motivated by a "natural" connection as in the case of icons, where relations of resemblance obtain between the sign vehicle and its object, or indices, where relations of co-presence obtain between the sign vehicle and its object. The signal systems characteristic of other species always depend on iconic or indexical linkages of sign vehicle and object for their effectiveness even when also conventionalized to some degree. Human groups also continue to signal by means of icons and indices, so the presence of symbolic signs does not eliminate the presence or significance of the other sign types. Indeed, language itself as a discursive semiotic is also always both iconic and indexical - and these dimensions of language have been the focus of increasing research attention in recent years.
Because they rely on cultural convention for their effectiveness, languages are essentially social rather than personal, objective rather than subjective. This allows language to be a medium for the socialization or objeciification of individual activities - including thought - to the extent that the activities depend on that medium. At the heart of this conventional system lies the symbolic component of language, the part that establishes sign-object relations purely on the basis of convention. This central symbolic component makes language an especially flexible signaling mode and makes possible the vast formal and functional diversity we see across language communities. Finally, because the language sign need not resemble its object or depend on its co-presence, speech can encompass any imaginable object including itself, thus providing the opportunity for metasemiotic commentary not only on all naturally based signals but also on itself, a reflexive capacity which underlies its potential to create system-internal and -external equivalences. Collectively, these semiotic properties (socialization/objectifixation,flexibility/diversity,and metasemiotic/reflexive capacity) which all stem from the symbolic dimension of language are the most interesting properties when comparing language with other sign modalities. A linguistic relativity proposal is a natural by-product of such a semiotic perspective. It asks about the significance of the socializing power of the diversity of language forms and functions, especially with regard to providing a vehicle for metacommentary on our actions. Indeed, it is the

41

self-reflexive capacity of language which underlies our ability to pose the question, to investigate it, and to transcend it at least analytically, if not habitually (Lucy 1993).

3 Linguistic (or structural) relativity
There are a great many natural languages and they differ in substantial and often surprising ways (Boas [1911] 1966, Sapir [1921] 1949c). In actuality, no person speaks "language-in-general" but always a particular language with its own characteristic structure of meaning. Any investigation of the relation between language and thought must cope with this structural diversity of natural languages by asking whether and to what extent the characteristics of specific languages have an impact on the thought or behavior of those who speak them. We can, following traditional usage, call this the hypothesis of linguistic relativity as long as we understand that by the term linguistic we mean the formal structure of semantic and pragmatic categories available for reference and predication. Where there is a potential for ambiguity in this review, the term structural relativity will be used in place of linguistic relativity.
3.1 Paucity of research
Despite the long tradition of thought and speculation about the implications of structural diversity among languages, there is little actual empirical research and most of it is poorly done. If we restrict ourselves to studies that compare at least two languages and the modes of thought associated with them, there have been only half a dozen studies in the last fifty years (Lucy 1992b). This situation is remarkable given the intense interest in the linguistic relativity issue. In such a context, it makes little sense to speak of the linguistic relativity proposal as having been empirically decided one way or the other at the present time.
The main impediment to research in this area has been the widespread, if tacit, acceptance of certain limiting assumptions about the relationship between language and thought generally. Since the late 1950s, mainstream psychological, linguistic, and cognitive science research on this issue has been guided by three closely linked assumptions which derive ultimately from deep-seated cultural orientations but which received renewed impetus from Piagetian developmental psychology and Chomskian generative linguistics (Piaget [1954] 1967, Inhelder & Piaget 1958, Chomsky 1972). First, there has been an assumption that basic cognitive processes are universal. Any variability in performance across populations is ascribed to mere differences in content. Second, these traditions have assumed that thought shapes language. Thus, when interesting correspondences emerge between cognitive performance and a

42

John A. Lucy

given language (e.g. English), they are routinely interpreted as having been determined by cognition. Third, these traditions assume that all languages must be fundamentally alike. This assumption may follow from the first two or may be independently posited. Since, by assumption, languages do not vary significantly, there is little reason to investigate their diverse forms.
One might expect a critique of this presumptive universalism from anthropologists and comparative linguists who are, as groups, less willing to discount linguistic diversity. Yet few are prepared to engage directly in the discourses of the other fields and many are reluctant to challenge the universality of cognitive processes given historical experience with evolutionary and racial interpretations of purported differences in mentality. By contrast, ideological universalism is ethically well received - its sometimes disastrous effects in our own century notwithstanding. Unable to mount a sophisticated critique of the notion of "basic cognitive processes" itself, or to challenge effectively the "mere content" view of cultural and linguistic differences, the aforementioned assumptions persist along with their chilling effects on research, public policy, and respect for other languages and cultures.

3.2 Review of existing research
Although concern with linguistic relativity has had a long history in the West, contemporary empirical research begins with the work of Benjamin Lee Whorf (1956a, b, Lucy 1985b, 1992b). Nearly all subsequent research has been stimulated by his work and lakes it as a point of departure. This subsequent work can be divided into two broad groups: research done by anthropological linguists and research done by psycholinguists.
3.2.1 Whorf Whorf conceived of his research as part of the larger anthropological project of documenting and understanding languages and cultures different from our own (cf. Fishman 1982). His predecessors Franz Boas ([1911] 1966) and Edward Sapir ([1924] 1949a, [1929] 1949d, [1931] 1964) speculated about the impact of language on thought, but Whorf was the first to try to demonstrate actual correspondences between the structural features of languages and specific modes of thought.
In his research Whorf (esp. 1956a) compared the formal meaning structures of two languages and then traced connections between such meaning structures and habitual thought as manifest in various cultural beliefs and institutions. For example, he showed that the Hopi and English languages encoded what we call "lime" differently and I hat this corresponded to distinct cultural orientations towards temporal notions. Specifically, Whorf argued that speakers of English treat cyclic

43

experiences of various sorts (e.g. the passage of a day or a year) in the same grammatical frame used for ordinary object nouns. Thus, English speakers are led to treat these cycles as object-like - they can be measured and counted just like tangible objects. English also treats objects as if they each have a form and a substance. Since the cyclic words get put into this object frame, English speakers are led to ask what is the substance associated with a day, a year, and so forth. Whorf argues that our global, abstract notion of "time" as a continuous, homogeneous formless something can be seen to arise to nil in the blank in this linguistic analogy. The Hopi by contrast do not treat these cycles as objects but as recurrent events. Thus, although they have, as Whorf acknowledged, words for what we would recognize as temporal cycles (e.g. days, years, etc.), their formal structuration in the grammar does not give rise to the abstract notion of "time" that we have. (Critics of Whorf's Hopi data [e.g. Malotki 1983] have managed to miss completely his point about structuration.) In Whorf's view, grouping referents and concepts as formally "the same" for the purposes of speech has led speakers to group those referents and concepts as substantively "the same" for action generally, as evidenced by related cultural patterns of belief and behavior.
Notice finally that there is an additional element to Whorf's formulation beyond language and thought: a reality against which the two linguistic patterns are tacitly compared but which was not itself seriously analyzed or explicated by him. The cyclic events and subjective experience of duration that he refers to are never fully analyzed. The practical consequences of this neglect are mitigated somewhat because he did not privilege either of the two languages but rather played them off against each other to establish his comparison. Herein lies the nucleus of a procedure for establishing a neutral basis for the comparison of language-reality relationships, a nucleus that has yet to be fully exploited. In short Whorf laid out the basic design of an approach to empirical research on linguistic relativity.

3.2.2 The anthropological linguists Other anthropological linguists who subsequently explored Whorf's proposals continued to link grammatical structures to broad cultural patterns. However, on the whole these studies examined a single grammatical form in a single exotic language and thereby effectively abandoned the effort to analyze a widespread grammatical pattern or to make systematic cross-Unguis tic comparisons. So, for example, in a classic study, Harry Hoijer (1953) examined a category concerned with motion in the Navajo verb and then sought evidence of parallels in the "motion" motifs in Navajo myths and nomadic history. It remains

44

John A. Lucy

unclear in studies of this sort how significant the grammatical pattern is in Navajo and how distinctive it is in comparison to other languages especially those spoken by culturally similar groups. Further, since there was no actual comparison of languages, the issue of a common reality (e.g., what counts as "motion") against which they could be assessed is not explicitly raised. More recent work on "motion" in Navajo language and culture (e.g. Witherspoon 1977), whatever its other merits, suffers from the same difficulties.
Research in the anthropological tradition also typically did not provide clear evidence for a non-linguistic correlate with grammatical patterns. Cultural analyses were either nonexistent or dominated by the use of linguistic materials as, for example, in the use of myth texts by Hoijer. In several cases, a purported relation between language and culture would turn out, under scrutiny, to be a relation between the grammatical structure of a language and the lexical structure of the same language (e.g. Mathiot 1964). An adequate study of the relation between language and thought should, by contrast, provide clear evidence of a correlation of language system with a pattern of non-linguistic belief and behavior individual or institutional. This is not to say that vocabulary items do not reflect non-unguis tic culture or that discourse using language does not provide important evidence about cultural beliefs, but only that, from a methodological point of view, such materials cannot be persuasive by themselves in showing broader effects of language. Much of the otherwise excellent recent anthropological work (which will be discussed further below) focusing on the creative play of grammatical categories in discourse or linking language structure to "linguistic ideologies" suffers from a similar Ungua-centrism.
In sum, by contrast with Whorf's formulation, the anthropological case studies have developed a truncated approach to the relativity problem. Thought has been assessed by reference to linguistic materials, the comparative dimension has been eliminated, and the tacit framework guiding the analyses has been an English-based view of reality. Only the linguistic analyses have had any depth to them as each author explored the interconnected meanings implicit in the structure of an exotic language and, in more recent years, expanded the focus lo the complex uses of language in cultural action.

3.2.3 The comparative psycholinguists Psychologists exploring Whorf's proposals abandoned his focus on largescale structural patterning in languages and focused instead on small sets of lexical items or, rarely, on specific features of grammar. In either case, they usually worked with only a single language, most often English. These researchers also criticized Whorf for not assessing individual

The scope of linguistic relativity

45

cognition and attempted to develop techniques for doing so. These studies can be divided into two groups: those looking at lexicon and those looking at grammar.

3.2.3.1 Research on lexicons Most psycholinguists working in this area shifted completely away from the sort of grammatical data central to Whorf's work and focused on lexical items - especially terms for colors. The meanings of these lexical items were established not by grammatical analysis but by reference to their typical denotational values - the "objects" they refer to. So, for example, American subjects were asked to list their color terms and then, subsequently, to show which of a set of color samples they applied to. Ironically, then, lexical content which had served to represent nonlinguistic "culture" for some anthropological linguists now served to represent "language" for these psycholinguists. Needless to say, a halfdozen color terms is a rather poor representative of "language."
In the most famous of these studies, Brown & Lenneberg (1954) tried to show that certain colors were more codable than others in English that is, subjects assigned them shorter names and tended to agree more on the application of those names to color samples. The more codable colors were recognized and remembered more readily than other colors. As one of the few rigorous studies purporting to show a cognitive effect in a field dominated by speculation, this work had enormous influence on subsequent research.
Yet notice how different this research is from WhorPs. The shift to studying codability (i.e., intersubject agreement in lexical denotation) was undertaken to simplify the research process, but it fundamentally altered the terms of the problem. First, the only "linguistic" variable remaining in the later studies in this tradition was the "code efficiency" of a set of lexical items used as labels for stimuli. Only stimulus input (a color) and behavioral output (correct or incorrect memory) were actually relevant. No evidence was presented that these forms constituted a distinctive, grammatically integrated set in the language. Second, this approach explicitly relied on a Western scientific characterization of reality (i.e., the color space). Because the conceptualization of language forms was in terms of an independently known and defined reality based on European languages, the whole approach undermined in principle the possibility of discovering genuinely different linguistic approaches to reality. Third, the tradition initially omitted any comparison of languages. Typically only one language received serious analysis and sometimes there was no linguistic analysis at all! (Some might count the work of Lenneberg & Roberts 1956 and Stefflre, Morely, &. Castillo 1966 as exceptions to these generalizations.)

46

John A. Lucy

Extensions of the early color work by anthropologists Berlin, Kay, their collaborators, and critics (Berlin & Kay 1969, Kay & McDaniel 1978, Heider 1972, Lucy & Shweder 1979, 1988) generated the first broad multilanguage comparative framework to actually be applied to the relativity question and one comparative case study by Heider (1972) of the relation of Language and thought. However, this comparative work still retained the lexical orientation and fundamentally Western conception of "color" characteristic of the earlier era. Rather than working from a comparatively induced typology of patterns of languageworld relationships, it showed instead the distribution of languages relative to a fixed set of parameters drawn from the Western European scientific tradition.
So despite its comparative orientation, it actually washed out linguistic differences and suggested that languages merely "reflect" or "map" reality. Whereas Whorf begins with the language structure and asks what it suggests about the implicit construal of reality, these studies begin with our reality as a given and ask how other languages handle it. Inevitably, this latter approach leads lo a conceptualization of language as a mere dependent variable, as a device for coding a pre-given reality.
Some examples of what is lost in this approach to language semantics through a highly controlled denotational task may be helpful. Zuni, a language of the American Southwest, exhibits two terms that we might translate as 'yellow' (Newman 1954). Closer analysis reveals that one term is verbal and refers to things that become yellow by ripening or aging whereas the other is adjectival and refers to things that have had yellow substances applied to them. The customary approach would select one term as "basic" (eliminating the other "nonbasic" term from further consideration) and ignore the aspect of its meaning (i.e., manner of becoming colored) for which there is no English equivalent. Hanunóo, a language of the Philippines, has four terms that seem to refer to what we call while, black, green, and fed but which under further analysis turn out to mean roughly 'lightness, darkness, wetness, and dryness' (Conkin 1955). These terms can then be used to discriminate color chips but this hardly reflects their central meaning. Turning to English, we have many words that have color reference as a central part of their meaning, but which also involve other meanings (Lucy 1992b). Consider for example blond, brunette, bay, sorrel, palomino, appaloosa, maroon, scarlet, etc. In fact, if we look broadly across a wide array of languages, we would conclude that the real linguistic regularity is that terms with colorrelevant meaning routinely seem to combine these meanings with plant and animal referents or with other lextural and light qualities (Lucy in press). The emergence of terms specialized for reference to color in some languages is of course interesting, but can hardly be taken as the standard

The scope of linguistic relativity

47

for what terms of other languages "really mean," nor should it lead us to ignore the semantic regularities in our own terms with such reference (Lucy in press).
An approach that carries an array of color stimuli around the world and asks people for the words that effectively discriminate among them (and do nothing else) will wash out all these linguistic patterns. It will inevitably confirm that pure color terms are a universal part of language with much the same sense as our own specialized terms since any variation that is observed will by definition lie within the Western-defined domain. The research procedure itself precludes any alternative finding. Notice too that radically different languages will tend to look deficient by comparison with our own to the extent that much of their descriptive vocabulary is eliminated from consideration. Although this research was important in highlighting the need for a comparative metalanguage of description, it did not, in the end, provide an adequate framework for the purposes of assessing relativity.
The Brown & Lenneberg study also inaugurated a tradition of assessing thought by presenting individual subjects with experimentally controlled memory tasks rather than by analyzing naturally occurring patterns of everyday belief and behavior. This use of experiments provided more control over some of the variables affecting performance but was accompanied by a shift of the research emphasis away from Whorf's concern with habitual thought and behavior and towards a concern with potential thought and behavior. So, in the cognitive realm, as in the linguistic realm discussed above, the search for methodological rigor led to a fundamental reformulation of the problem. The considerable gains in control were offset by the ambiguous status of the experiments as representations of habitual behavior, that is, as culturally valid representations of thought.

3.2.3.2 Research on grammar Through the 1970s only a few of these psychological studies explored (rather inconclusively) the cognitive significance of grammatical patterns or systematically compared two or more languages (e.g. Carroll & Casagrande 1958). Those researchers who did so retained the preference for experimental assessment of individual behavior characteristic of the psycholinguistics tradition. Unfortunately, their linguistic analyses also showed exactly the same weaknesses as the anthropological studies cited above in that no attempt was made to relate the categories at issue to other categories in the language or to similar categories in other languages. Thus, each study only described a single categorical distinction in a single language even when behavioral data were collected on two or three language groups. In each case, the tacit metalanguage for

48

John A. Lucy

linguistic characterization was "reality" (a world of objects) as construed in or viewed from English.
More recently Alfred Bloom (1981) and others (Au 1983, Liu 1985) have explored the relation between certain types of counterfactual markers in Chinese and English and speakers' facility with hypothetical reasoning. Bloom used an experimental design where he presented stories to English and Chinese speakers with the Chinese receiving translations of English texts. English speakers did better at the counterfactual reasoning tasks, and Bloom then generalized to the utility of systematic marking of counterfactuals to sustain theoretical, specifically scientific, modes of thought. However, since the stimulus materials were not absolutely identical in the two cases, his approach led to a number of ambiguities. Critics raised questions about whether certain of the Chinese sentences really meant what he claimed they meant. These disputes quickly degenerated into an unresolvable battle over the accuracy and fairness of the Chinese translation of the English constructions (see review in Lucy 1992b). There is no way to resolve such disputes except by appeal to what speakers would actually typically say about a concrete situation; but this could not be tested since the counterfactual stones by definition did not correspond to any observable events.
Further, a close reading of Bloom's original materials reveals that the various linguistic devices he describes do not form a structural set in grammatical terms but can only be identified by reference to their common use in a certain discourse mode. Further, the differences in how much co unter factual discourse the two groups engage in and how they value it seem much more telling than any structural differences. Despite the ambiguity of Bloom's results, his approach was especially significant in that experimental work and cultural analysis were brought together for the first time.

3.3 Towards a new approach
From this brief survey of previous empirical research we can abstract the requirements for an improved approach to research on the cognitive implications of structural diversity among languages. Such research should be comparative in that it should deal with two or more languages. It should deal with a significant language variable such as one or more central grammatical categories rather than a relatively minor vocabulary set. It should assess the cognitive performance of individual speakers aside from explicitly verbal contexts and try to establish that any cognitive patterns that are detected also characterize everyday behavior outside of the assessment situation. Finally, studies that deal with referential categories, that is with categories which denote objects and

The scope of linguistic relativity

49

relations in the world, rather than with categories having to do solely with language-internal relations, will provide a variety of advantages for empirical research in terms of developing comparative frames and cognitive assessment procedures.
Over the past several years I have developed a systematic approach to the investigation of the relation between such diversity in language and thought with the aim of filling the gaps in our knowledge and methodology (Lucy 1992b). The research aims to be absolutely explicit about what features of language are significant for thought and how they are significant. These studies combine careful comparison of well-defined aspects of grammar with rigorous demonstration of highly distinctive patterns of perception, classification, or memory.
My first major empirical research using this approach (Lucy 1992a) explored the ways structural differences between American English and Yucatec Maya might affect the cognition of speakers of those languages. The research shows that these two languages encode objects in quite different ways and that these differences affect the nonverbal cognitive performance of adult speakers. Specifically, the research focused on the relationship between grammatical number marking and patterns of memory and classification in tasks involving objects and pictures. Since a great many languages in Asia and the Americas share the Yucatec pattern (Lyons 1977) and most European languages share the English pattern, these differences hold important implications for a broad array of languages.
English and Yucatec differ in their number marking patterns. First, the two languages contrast in the way they signal plural. English speakers obligatorily signal plural for a large number of lexical nouns whereas Yucatec speakers optionally signal plural for a comparatively small number of lexical nouns. Specifically, English speakers mark plural for nouns referring to animate entities and ordinary objects but not for amorphous substances (e.g. sugar, mud, etc.). Yucatec speakers sometimes mark plural for animate entities (although it is not obligatory even when referring to multiple referents) and only occasionally mark it for any other type of referent.
In nonverbal experimental tasks involving complex pictures, Americans and Mayans were sensitive to the number of various types of objects in accordance with the patterns in their grammar. The pictures showed scenes of everyday Yucatecan village life and contained different numbers of referents of the various types. Speakers performed tasks which involved remembering the pictures (recall and recognition) and sorting them on the basis of similarity. In remembering and classifying, English speakers were sensitive to number for animate entities and objects but not for substances. By contrast, Yucatec speakers were sensitive to number

only for animate entities. Note in this experiment that the two groups had very similar patterns of response for the animate and substance referents where the two languages roughly agree in structure, but that they differed with respect to ordinary object referents, that is, where the grammars of the two languages are in maximal contrast. So the group difference is not one of absolute level of performance, but rather of different qualitative responses. Neither group's performance can rightly be regarded as superior or inferior - just different.
Second, the two languages contrast in the way they treat numerals and this contrast derives from a deep underlying difference between the two languages. English numerals directly modify their associated nouns (e.g. one candle) whereas Yucatec numerals must be accompanied by a special form usually referred to as a numeral classifier which typically provides crucial information about the shape or material properties of the referent of the noun (e.g. Wíz'ú'r kib\ 'one long thin candle'). Numeral classifiers are a well-known grammatical type and occur in a wide variety of languages throughout the world, perhaps most notably in the languages of Asia - Chinese, Japanese, Thai, etc. In my view, the classifiers reflect the fact that all lexical nouns in Yucatec are semantically unspecified as to essential quantifications unit. In the case of nouns with concrete reference, it is almost as if they referred to unformed substances. So, for example, the semantic sense of the Yucatec word kib* in the example cited above is better glossed as 'wax' (i.e., 'one long thin wax') - even though when occurring alone without a numeral modifier it usually refers to objects with the form and function that we call "candle." Once one understands the substance focus of such nouns it becomes obvious that one must specify a unit (i.e., provide a classifier) when counting (i.e., 'one wax* would not make sense). By contrast, many concrete nouns in English include the notion of 'unit' or 'form' as part of their basic meaning - so when we count these nouns, we can simply use the numeral directly without any classifier (e.g. one candle). Where our pattern is like the Maya, we use the functional equivalent of a classifier ourselves: a cube of sugar.
In experimental tasks involving classifying triads of certain lest objects (i.e., "Is item X more like A or more like B?"), English speakers showed a relative preference for shape-based classifications whereas Mayan speakers showed a relative preference for material-based classifications - results in line with the expectations based on the underlying lexical structures of the two languages. So, for example, speakers were shown a small cardboard box of the type used for holding cassette tapes and asked whether it was more like a small plastic box of roughly the same size and shape or more like a small piece of cardboard about the size of a half-dollar. English speakers consistently matched on the basis

of shape and chose the box. Yucatec speakers consistently matched on the basis of material and chose the small piece of cardboard. The same sorts of preferences also emerged in other more indirect tests. Also, once again, both patterns of classification are reasonable and neither can rightly be described as superior to the other.
Notice that this research begins with a linguistic comparison which places both languages on an equal footing. It locates and then examines in detail a pervasive and semantically significant lexico-grammatical contrast, one patently relevant to a wide array of other languages. It does not attempt to work within a single language, nor take English as the standard for assessing other languages, nor focus on a minor or rarely occurring category. It then asks about the possible implications of the linguistic patterns for the interpretation of experience generally. These implications are then converted into specific qualitative predictions about the nonverbal performance of individual speakers of the languages both where they will be similar and where they will be different. These predictions are then tested with an array of simple tasks using materials designed to maximize real-world interpretabilily. The research does not simply look for language effects in other verbal behaviors, nor does it frame the assessment in terms of deficits, accuracy, or a hierarchy of complexity, nor does it undertake the assessment without serious consideration of the cultural context. In short, although much remains to be done especially with regard to tracing broader cultural ramifications of these patterns, the study articulates an approach to research in this area that remedies many of the deficiencies of earlier work.
In current research I am extending this work to new grammatical categories, exploring the ontogeny of these patterns in childhood, and tracing links between the linguistic forms and traditional Maya cosmology. For example, one of the more exciting side benefits of establishing an adult contrast of the sort just described is that it can be used as a diagnostic for the onset of language effects during cognitive development. In collaboration with Suzanne Gaskins (Lucy 1989), I have recently completed pilot research on the developmental course of the language-thought connection. Comparing Mayan and American children, it appears that young children in both groups favor shape over material as a basis of classification but that a pronounced change occurs by the age of eight. No child under the age of seven favored material as a basis of classification. In the Mayan case, there is a shift from the age of eight onward to classifying on the basis of material just as do Mayan adults. In the English case, the early shape preference weakens at the age of seven with the emergence of wide variability in individual response pattern. This variability is consistent both with the English grammatical pattern (which splits its lexicon) and with the observed variability in the

52

John A. Lucy

adult English sample. However, it is also overtly similar to the pattern for young children in both groups and further work will be necessary to adequately characterize the English population and distinguish it from the shape-preference characteristic of younger children. Pooling all ages from three to twelve, the Maya were more likely to classify on the basis of material than were the Americans for ten out of the twelve triads. This pilot research not only further substantiates the original work, it also gives us some insight into when these grammatical patterns begin to play a shaping role in cognition. Recent work by Imai & Gentner (1993) using similar materials on Japanese, another classifier language, found similar material preferences - at least for some object-type referents - and increased sensitivity to material-based alternatives as early as the age of two in language-learning contexts - in contrast to English-speaking children. These results suggest that the original findings may generalize to other languages.

4 Discursive (or functional) relativity
There is more to language than its structure of reference and predication. There is another dimension of language variation that deserves our attention. Even within a single language, there is always diversity in the ways it is used. These differences in usage may be associated with subgroups in the language community (social dialects - e.g. classcharacteristic modes of speech) or with differences in contexts of speaking (functional registers - e.g. formal discourse) (Halliday 1978). There are further differences in patterns of usage when we compare diverse linguistic communities (Hymes 1974, Gumperz 1982, Gumperz & Hymes 1972). Any investigation of the relation between language and thought must also cope with this level of functional diversity in natural languages. The question is whether patterns of use have an impact on thought either directly or by virtue of amplifying or channeling any effects due to linguistic structure. We can call this the hypothesis of discursive relativity, a relativity stemming from diversity in the functional (or goal-oriented) configuration of language means in the course of (inter)action.
4.1 Early formulations
Although there has been a long history of concern with language functions within anthropology (e.g. Malinowski 1923), anthropological linguist Dell Hymes (1961, 1966) was one of the first to argue that any claims about linguistic relativity of the structural sort are dependent on certain commonalities in the cultural uses or functions of language. Thus,

The scope of linguistic relativity

53

proposals about structural relativity require assuming a loose isofunctionality across languages of the everyday use of speech to accomplish acts of descriptive reference. There is now a significant body of research indicating that there is in fact substantial cultural diversity in the uses and valuations of language.
Similar arguments have been made for the intellectual effects of variation of usage within a single language. For example, there have been broad claims by psychologist Lev Vygolsky (1978, 1987) and others for the significance of literacy, formal education, and technical-scientific language for thought. Likewise sociologist Basil Bernstein (1971) has argued that class-characteristic differences in the use of what he called elaborated and restricted codes within a single language community relate to facility with certain types of thought. Both of these approaches deal primarily with the appropriation for cognitive ends of linguistic structures associated with the referential function of language. In such cases, the various effects of language structure on habitual thought are either simply amplified by more intensive application or ideologically reshaped via purification and elaboration to achieve certain cultural goals more effectively. Such discursive practices simultaneously embody and sustain cultural goals, hence the dual relevance of ethnographic description and interactive analysis in examining them.
Non referential functions of language (e.g. social, expressive, aesthetic, etc.) have received much less attention. The focus on reference-andpredication makes some sense given that this appears to be the dominant function of language from a semiotic-structural point of view. However, there is no necessary reason why linkages between other functions of language and human thought could not also be investigated. Further, there may well be linkages to other aspects of individual functioning such as emotion, self-concept, etc. Although there are marked differences among languages in their pragmatic or expressive qualities, it is by no means obvious how to approach their study in a systematic way. Most existing research on language use or discourse consists of case studies with uncertain generalizability and, even when explicitly addressed to the relation of language and culture, remains heavily language-centered lacking substantive analysis of broader psychological or social correlates. The balance of this section will be limited to indicating one possible approach to a comparatively grounded typology of functions and then providing examples of the sort of issues which might be explored.
4.2 Towards a new formulation
An overarching framework for characterizing these various forms of functional relativity and investigating their effects simply does not yet exist. By way of illustration of what such a framework might look like,

54

John A. Lucy

let us take with some modification Roman Jakobson's (I960) well-known typology of the semiotic functions of language. (For other uses and elaborations of Jakobson's scheme, see Hymes 1974 and Silverstein 1985a.)
Jakobson's typology is anchored in the components of the speech situation. He describes three functions which will be regarded here as primary. The first, and central, function of language is the referential or cognitive function which has to do with referring to and/or predicating about something in the context. Centered on the third-person pronominal forms, it receives formal recognition in the indicative mood. Diversity in the referential function lies at the center of traditional concerns about linguistic relativity. The referential function deals with the general context, hence variability in this sphere corresponds to a potential variability in the construal of reality. The traditional question of linguistic relativity, viewed in this fashion, has to do with the relation of the structure of the referential function to speakers' conceptions of reality.
The other two primary functions have to do with the nonreferential or, to use Sapir's (11933] 1949b) term, expressive functions of language. First, the emotive function focuses on language's capacity to index speakers' attitudes and feelings towards what is spoken about. Centered on the first-person pronouns, it receives formal recognition in interjections and the conditional mood. Second, the conative function has to do with language's capacity to affect addressees and get them to act. Centered on the second-person pronominal forms, it receives formal recognition in vocatives and the imperative mood. Anthropological linguists have long been concerned with the differing pragmatic or expressive values of language forms, but with the exception of Hymes's work mentioned above and my own work (Lucy 1989), they have rarely formulated the concern in terms of a possible relativity.
Jakobson cites two further functions both of which are reflexive in that they refer to or index language form and use itself. The first is the metalingual function which corresponds to forms which communicate about the code structure of language (e.g. in glossing): it uses a languageinternal sequence to build an equation. We can easily imagine a different metalingual apparatus and consequent differences in the understandings and control over language. In recent years, the implications of relativity of this sort for thought have been of central concern to some anthropological linguists, most notably Michael Silverstein (1979, 1981; cf. Lucy 1993) and others interested in linguistic ideology (e.g. Hill 1985 and Rumsey 1990).
The second reflexive function is the poetic function which corresponds to forms which communicate about the'message form itself: it uses an equation (parallelism) to build a sequence. Here there is a long history of

The scope of linguistic relativity

55

concern abbut the different sensibility implicated in different languages in their poetic forms. More broadly, the poetic function of language is implicated in all language use in the regular structuring of meanings into utterances and texts. These, of course, differ substantially across languages. Several anthropological linguists, notably Paul Friedrich (1986), have argued for some years now that the significant locus of relativity is in the poetic or aesthetic realm - that is, when discourse foregrounds this function (see also Sherzer 1987b, 1990; Urban 1991; Caton 1990).
This semiotic typology needs further refinement and formal grounding. It must also be brought into correspondence with other typologies of language function which focus on the psychological or social functionality of language (e.g. that of Michael Halliday 1973, 1978) and with a consideration of the functional impact of different mediational means (e.g. writing, see Goody & Watt 1968, Cole & Scribner 1981). It may eventually be possible to encompass within a unified theory the significant effects that arise from the variable forms of these other functions of language on analogy with the referential function (see Silverstein 1979).

4.3 Empirical research on functional differences
In the present context, it will only be possible to provide examples of how languages do vary discursively in ways that are relevant for both the psychological functioning of individual speakers and cultural interactions more broadly. One example each will be given for referential uses, expressive uses, and, in the context of a discussion of the interaction of linguistic structure and discursive function, reflexive uses.
4.3. J Referential uses of language Let us turn first to differences in the referential uses of language. Lev Vygotsky (1978, 1987; see also Lucy 1988, 1989; Lucy & Wertsch 1987) provides analysis of one type of variation in the use of language, that which arises from formal schooling. By school age, children have developed an array of conceptual representations which approximate adult forms in their outward aspect. Yet outward appearances can be misleading and Vygotsky claims that children of this age still lack true or "scientific" concepts, that is, concepts which are subject to conscious awareness, are under voluntary control, and form part of an organized system. In a sense, to develop further children now have to engage in a highly reflexive activity, namely, bringing the process of conceptualization itself under voluntary conceptual control. This involves placing their spontaneous concepts into a hierarchical system of relationships with other concepts.

56

John A. Lucy

However, from his studies of the cognitive abilities of Russian peasants, Vygotsky had come to believe that true scientific concepts did not develop of their own accord but only under the influence of formal schooling - that is, within a specific institutional structure. Scientific concepts are acquired ready-made in the school context as children learn them by explicit verhai definition and use, that is, within a context of conscious voluntary manipulation of the linguistic code structure.
Once encountered, scientific concepts begin to interact with the children's own spontaneous concepts. Spontaneous concepts provide the concrete materials with which to enter into and comprehend the more abstract discourse of schooling; the scientific concepts encountered in the school context provide the framework for organizing and bringing under conscious voluntary control the child's existing spontaneous concepts. Scientific concepts grow downward to find concrete content; spontaneous concepts grow upward to find abstract, systematic form. The interaction between spontaneous and scientific concepts generates the final phase of development wherein children gain conscious control over their own concepts and thinking. Thus, this final phase of development depends for its emergence on the specific verbal practices associated with formal schooling. In essence, a new functional demand from the social arena promotes a major structural reorganization of individual thought. This development depends on the socially and historically specific practices associated with schooling. Schooled children become aware that word meanings relate to one another as elements of structured systems and derive a portion of their meaning from their place in such systems. Once cognizant of this aspect of language, children can exploit more of the latent power of language as an instrument of thought (cf. Sapir [1921] 1949c).
Others have made proposals similar to Vygotsky's and over the last two decades it has become increasingly common to view schooling as inculcating specialized uses of language. However, little of this research has explored exactly which language practices affect cognition. This is of tremendous importance because what is called schooling need not be the same everywhere and some practices other than formal schooling may have similar effects. Available cross-cultural research comparing a range of schooled and unschooled populations by Michael Cole and others (Sharp, Cole, & Lave 1979; Scribner & Cole 1973; see Rogoff 1981) suggests that many of the effects of schooling derive from specific training in certain skills such as the use of two-dimensional representations, the organization and memory of disconnected information, and intensified use of the decontextual and reflexive qualities of natural language. The various sorts of institutions called vschools" may embody these characteristics to a greater or lesser degree (see the work of Stigler &

57

Perry 1988 who compare the diverse styles of mathematics instruction in Japanese, Chinese, and American schools).
This work on schooling converges with various lines of research in anthropology, psychology, sociology, and education which have attempted to articulate the implications of characteristic patterns of language use in certain class or ethnic groups for their school performance (Labov 1975, Bernstein 1971, Heath 1983, Hymes 1980, Bourdieu 1984), the significance of various forms of literacy for patterns of thought (Goody & Walt 1968, Greenfield 1972, Goody 1977, Olson 1977, Cole & Scribner 1981, Street 1984, Cook-Gumperz 1986), and the importance of language socialization practices for the inculcation of cultural world-view (Ochs & Schieffelin 1984; Schieffelin & Ochs 1986a, b; Ochs 1988; Miller 1986; Miller & Sperry 1987,1989). The latter body of research is especially important because it reveals vividly the cultural and subcultural diversity of language practices. Unfortunately, very little of this research actually attempts to demonstrate cognitive effects. Among the aspects of language use which vary and which might be relevant to cognition are semiformalized patterns of presentation and dispute, training children to recite long texts, prompting a child what to say, expanding children's utterances, using leading questions, announcing activities/events for a child, verbal teasing and joking, and using a simplified lexicon and grammar. For example, routine challenges to arguments might be internalized by the child and used to examine his or her own thought; teasing might promote reflexive awareness of the problematic relation of language and reality. In both these cases everyday practice may promote the sort of voluntary, reflexive attention to language categories that Vygotsky argued was central in schooled discourse.

4.3.2 Expressive uses of language Variability in the structures of the expressive function of language have also been studied but again not with an eye towards their constitutive role in individual functioning. One particularly vivid example is provided by Michelle Rosaldo's (1973) discussion of the public oratory of the Ilongot, a people of the Philippines. Ilongot oratory is used in public meetings by opposed parties who must find their way towards an agreement without the aid of a judge or arbitrator. The highly public nature of these speech events compels speakers to appeal somewhat more explicitly to social norms and ideals of order than would be common in private disputes in an attempt to find truth or establish the right course of action when these are far from clear. The oratory makes extensive use of a culturally recognized mode of speech which Rosaldo translates as 'crooked speech.' Crooked speech allows a man to hide behind his words or distance himself from them; it achieves indirection and disguise of intent.

58

John A. Lucy

Aesthetically, the speech is felt to be anful, witty, and charming. Formally, it is characterized by iambic stresses, phonological elaboration, metaphor, repetition, and puns. It contrasts with 'straight' speech which is used for everyday life.
Rosa Id o then discusses how this mode of oratory is disrupted by the encounter with alternative ideals drawn from the wider Philippine sphere, a sphere now heavily influenced by speech norms of the West. Some speakers now adopt 'straight speech' as their ideal for oratory. This straight speech involves a more active body posture, appeals to external authorities, disparagement of indirection, imposition of new forms of organization on the interaction, and substitution of new metaphors. Although it might seem that these are just substitutes of new oratorical conventions for old, Rosaldo argues that there is an important difference.
... the idea of 'crooked' language is not, for traditional llongots, one of deviousness or deception; rather it seems to be linked to the feeling thai men are equal, individual, and difficult to understand ... there is no simple path to truLh, justice, or understanding; ... linguistic elaboration, and areflectiveinterest in rhetoric, belongs to societies in which no one can command another's interest or attention, let alone enforce his compliance. In such societies, rhetoric may be a kind of'courtship*.,., or it may, as in the Ilongot case, be an acknowledgement of the real differences among individuals and the elusiveness of human truth. The contrasting attitude, which prefers a plain and simple style, will be associated with any social order which recognizes an ultimate and knowable authority - be it god, or science, or the army.
It remains to be seen whether Rosaldo's suspicions about the linkage of complex, indirect rhetoric with an egalitarian ethos tolerant of difference (versus simple, direct speech with an authoritarian ethos not so tolerant) will appear in other societies and whether it will generalize to nonlinguistic beliefs and behaviors. What is crucial here is that the proposed linguistic effect has little to do with direct referential content - it is not that the llongots have lexico-grammatical forms specifically referring to an egalitarian self. Rather, the effect is due to an implicit ethos embodied in the very way language is used - llongots use a variety of lexicogrammatical resources in a way that implies (or presupposes) an egalitarian view of others. In short, the expressive values of speech are rather consciously deployed in a way that both reflects and constitutes a certain attitude towards social reality. Indeed, conscious valuation of the style implicates a reflexive poetic evaluation that must also be grasped in any treatment of psychological effects.
It is worth emphasizing that this Ilongot example is by no means exhaustive of the range of possibilities. We know that the opportunities for expression in language vary in many ways. We can mention, by way of further example, pronoun systems which indicate differing relationships

59

of power and solidarity (e.g. widespread Indo-European pronominal alternates of the lujvous type: Brown & Gilman I960), systematic cultural shaping of expressive differences between men's and women's speech ([Ochs] Keenan 1974, Sherzer 1987a), subtlety of modes of indirection in making requests (Ervin-Tripp 1976), and different verbal norms for the expression of emolions (e.g. anger: Miller & Sperry 1987). In short, the rich product of the ethnographic study of language has yet to be brought seriously to play in direct consideration of the relativity of experience associated with the diversity of functions and uses of language.

5 Ideology and the dialectic of linguistic structure and discursive function
In the specific examples just given, we did not need to make reference to particular lexical or grammatical structures of the languages involved; and it may well be thai there are many usage effects which arise independently of (or across) particular linguistic structures. More generally, of course, language structure and discourse functionality do not exist in isolation from one another, and the two may interact in important ways. Discourse patterns can influence the impact of structural patterns by altering the frequency of use of certain forms or by channeling them in certain directions. In time, the systematic use of a given form in one context will alter its structural value in the language generally. A given context of use can even give rise, via emphasis on a specific semiotic function, to a specific structural element. Inversely, certain structural facts may facilitate the emergence of particular uses of language, or come to shape the discourses dependent on them, in characteristic ways. We have virtually no empirical research addressing this issue, but theory and research will eventually have to deal directly with the interplay between specific cognitive and cultural uses of language and particular structural-functional configurations (cf. Lucy & Wertsch 1987, Lucy 1989, Bloom 1981).
Typically, such interactions of structure and function are mediated by certain ideologies of language which reflexively structure discursive practice (Silverstein 1979, 1985b). These ideologies add another dimension to the interaction of structure and use as speakers bring their reflective understanding of language to bear on intensionalizing and regimenting their practice and as these reflections are themselves influenced by the matrix language. Working out the details of such interactions of structure, function, and ideology remains an enormous untackled problem. One example, one with purported intellectual consequences, will have to serve here to illustrate the complex issues involved as particular language structures, social patterns of language use, and ideologies of language converge historically to produce a

60

John A. Lucy

characteristic culture of language. (For other case studies, see Silverstein 1985b and Banfield 1978.)
An example of ideologically mediated structural-functional interplay in the referential domain appears in the intellectualization or rationalization of the standard language (i.e., the language of public life and the workplace) in the West as analyzed by Bohuslav Havránek ([1932] 1964). The functional goal of intellectualization of language forms is to make possible precise, rigorous, and, if necessary, abstract statements capable of expressing a certain complexity of thought. Such language forms may be required for legal, bureaucratic, or technical purposes and reach their fullest elaboration as a functional type in scientific discourse wherein lexical items approximate concepts and sentences approximate logical judgments. In such a case, we must recognize that the decision to use language as an aid to thought and action in this way is itself a cultural achievement and not something to be taken as given. Although the primary rationale for such forms of speech lies in the practical need for standardization in a large and complex social formation, an important secondary rationale lies precisely in the perceived advantages of such speech forms in supporting more precise, "accurate" thinking.
The intellectualization of the standard language manifests itself in the lexicon not only by a simple expansion of the vocabulary but also by changes in the structural relations among words. In order to provide unequivocal words, special distinctions, and abstract summarizing terms, new words must be created or old words adapted - words to express relationships such as existence, possibility, necessity, relations of causality, finality, parallelism, and the like (e.g. unsubstantiated). This entails a specialization of word formative patterns to express abstracted concrete events by a variety of forms such as substance of quality, verbal nouns, verbal adjectives, participial expressions, etc.
Intellectualization also affects the grammatical structure of the language. This is manifested in a preference for nominal groupings brought about by combining nouns with attributes or by nominal predication using empty verbs, a preference for the normalized sentence with clear formal differentiation of the subject and predicate, and a desire to achieve parallelism between the grammatical form and underlying logical structure - for instance by the expanded use of the passive voice. Finally, there is a preference for a tightly knit and integrated structure of sentences and compound sentences with an elaborate hierarchy of superordination and subordination expressing different relations of causality, finality, parallelism, and the like; this tendency also manifests itself in a certain specialization of conjunctions.
This intellectualized or rationalized language sacrifices everyday intelligibility for accuracy. General intelligibility and clarity cannot be

61

the gauge of the accuracy of expression of a mathematical work or a legal document. Where everyday language achieves definiteness of reference by a combination of language conventions and appeal to situation, this rationalized language seeks to achieve a definiteness solely by use of an elaborate set of decontextualized conventional forms, that is, forms denned and codified so as to be generally valid rather than situationally contingent. Ultimately, speakers will require elaborate training or formal schooling in these conventions in order to be able to understand the code and use it to achieve the goals it was designed for. Socially disadvantaged speakers who lack the presupposed language skills, for example those from lower-class strata or minority language communities, may be closed out of certain occupational spheres. Indeed, socially advantaged speakers who control these language patterns may have privileged access to such spheres despite real deficiencies in qualifications in other respects.
Such an ideology can become widespread or even dominant in a culture generally by being valued and therefore analogically extended outside of the sphere(s) in which it first developed. This, again, is a cultural achievement and not necessary. Such a characteristic or dominant linguistic ideology will embody a culturally and historically specific world-view which may appear arbitrary, admirable, or foolish from the outside. Thus Bloom (1981) reports Chinese speakers' reluctance to accept or participate in the theoretical, context-independent mode of discourse characteristic of the West which they regard as amoral in some contexts. In a similar vein Carol Cohn (1987) has critically analyzed the dehumanizing implications of this intellectualized mode of discourse within nuclear strategic war-planning groups in the US and Pierre Bourdieu (1984) has made similar observations about the Western intellectual tradition generally. Bloom, Cohn, Bourdieu, and others have noted that although this mode of rationalized, decontextualized discourse achieves certain advantages in terms of scientific theory construction, it brings concomitant disadvantages insofar as it separates speakers from sensitivity to actual situations. Such an alienation from concrete realities can result in failed ethical engagement and moral action in the world. The crucial point in this, of course, is that this mode of orientation to the world is now richly embodied in the lexical and grammatical structure of the language itself - especially in the standard language of the dominant class strata. And as Whorf (1956b) noted long ago, speakers will, quite predictably, take the elements of their language as "natural" and "given" in the world. In a sense, then, we can say this linguistic ideology has been "naturalized" in our linguistic culture.
Finally, a given discursive practice which ideologically regiments language structure to certain ends can spread beyond the original linguistic and cultural milieu in which it developed. In the case of

62

John A. Lucy

Ilongot oratory discussed above, the Western ideology oflanguage, with its discursive emphasis on the isomorphism of language form and thought, may come into conflict with another ideology and may come to displace it. In the case of Chinese use of counterfactuals, Bloom (1981) reports that certain existing grammatical forms have now been reinterpreted, others applied more systematically, and still others recruited to new functions to achieve "clarity" from the new point of view. What is telling in this latter case as one reads the contending points of view in the literature disputing or defending Bloom's results is that native Chinese speakers with different degrees of exposure to Western languages and discursive practices now disagree fundamentally about what the Chinese language is (or was) "really like."
In still more extreme cases, specific syntactic patterns associated with a given discursive norm can be imported into a distinct linguistic community and directly promulgated by an influential elite to produce a new structural-functional register. For example, in Thai, "syntactic reform" modeled on Sanskrit, Latin, and English aimed to produce a grammar which was more "logical" and capable of being precise and unambiguous regardless of context (Diller 1993: esp. pp. 396ff.). Verb conjugations and case markings were created out of periphrastic constructions, normative word order was defined along with an acrossthe-board passive, previously ubiquitous noun and pronoun deletion were discouraged (with important sociolinguistic consequences), new lexical items were added, new modes of address were established, etc. This elite register has since been promulgated through written grammars, the school system, and by elite usage as correct or proper Thai. The cognitive effects of such transformations for Thai speakers can only be guessed at without specific study, but the potential effects of discursive ideology on language structure should be clear. Ironically, one upshot of this wholesale ideological transformation of the grammar is that Western scholars can now "discover" that Thai (i.e., in its formalized "high" register) fits comfortably into the discursive and even structural patterns expected on the basis of research with the more familiar European languages.
These examples of Western formal schooling, Ilongot public oratory, and modern technical language involve focused manipulations oflanguage for social, intellectual, aesthetic, or political ends and these manipulations each depend in turn on accepting a certain ideology oflanguage at several degrees of generality. Yet such an ideology oflanguage itself arises initially in a discourse which draws on the available language forms and usages in a powerful and intimate way. That is, our very understanding oflanguage as a cultural phenomenon may draw in important ways on the structures and uses characteristic of our own language. Indeed, a number of observers have suggested that our formulation of the linguistic relativity

problem itself bears the traces of our own linguistic structures and dominant ideological perspective on the nature of discursive interaction (Lucy 1985a, Rumsey 1990, Reddy 1979). It is this reflexive aspect of the linguistic relativity problem which makes it one of the more profoundly difficult and important methodological problems for all the human disciplines (Lucy 1993).

6 Summary
Natural language adds a dimension to human life not present in other species and may give rise to a semiotic relativity. The distinctive semiotic property of natural language is its symbolic component. Language retains the iconic and indexical properties characteristic of other signalling systems, but they are transformed by their conjunction with the symbolic aspect to create a communicative medium of extraordinary flexibility and diversity with implications for both the social objectification of thought and the emergence of reflective awareness. These are the aspects of natural language which will be most relevant to tracing its potential implications for thought, belief, and behavior.
The traditional linguistic relativity proposal is concerned with the implications for thought of the use of diverse natural languages. To dale, despite the manifest importance of the problem, there has been very little empirical research at all, and not much of what exists has been adequately formulated. These problems stem from both disciplinary differences and broader cultural attitudes. Adequate investigation of the proposal must be comparative, deal with significant language structures and actual speakers, and come to grips with the problem of developing a comparative metalanguage. A few studies meeting these standards now exist.
More recent research on language use (or functioning) suggests the possibility of another form of relativity, a discursive relativity, centering on the cultural deployment of specialized speech modes. Although there is a growing body of research on language use, it has not been systematically evaluated in terms of its implications for thought. Such an evaluation would have to meet the same standards of adequacy already mentioned for structural relativity, but would, additionally, have to develop a typology of language functions within which a comparison could be made. Existing typologies suggest that research attention needs to be broadened beyond the traditional preoccupation with the referential capacity of language and its intellectual consequences to include an examination of the potential effects of diversity in the expressive uses of language on personal and social functioning. Some existing theory and research (e.g. on formal schooling and political oratory) can be profitably reinterpreted within this framework.

Finally, structural and functional factors may interact with one another. The existence of a certain structure of meaning may facilitate the emergence of certain specialized uses of language; a given discourse mode may amplify or channel existing structural meanings or create a new level of structural order. In such interactions, various ideologies of language may play a pivotal role in the essenlialization and regimentation of both structure and use, and both language categories and cultural requirements for speaking may, in turn, shape the available linguistic ideologies. Finally, such ideologies may spread beyond their original cultural or subcultural niche to influence substantially different linguistic and discursive systems. These interactive problems have been little studied to date - at least with regard to their broader cultural and psychological consequences.
Because of the linguistic relativity he saw, Whorf placed the science of language at the center of all efforts to advance human understanding. However, from an empirical point of view, we have done little in the last half century to expand on his insights. However, when we join his work with a fuller semiotic analysis, with more recent research on the discursive (or functional) diversity among languages, and with a consideration of the role of linguistic ideologies in shaping their interaction, we can articulate more clearly the scope and complexity of the problem he identified. An adequate understanding of the dynamic interaction between language, culture, and self will depend on exploring the full scope of linguistic relativity.

FROM 'THOUGHT AND LANGUAGE" TO ''THINKING FOR SPEAKING"
DAN I. SLOBIN
Language is the formative organ of thought... Thought and language are.. .one and inseparable from each other.
Wilhelm von Humboldt ([1836] 1988: 54)
[T]he true difference between languages is not in what may or may not be expressed but in what must or must not be conveyed by the speakers
Roman Jakobson (1959:142)
Early in the last century, Wilhelm von Humboldt provided the Leitmotif for the study of linguistic relativity and determinism. The title of his great work on language clearly points to the central theme: The diversity of human language-structure and its influence on the mental development of mankind ([1836] 1988).l Languages differ from one another; thought and language are inseparable; therefore each speech community embodies a distinct world-view. The two critical terms here are thought and language, with broad-ranging definitions of each. For example, in von Humboldt's terms: "There resides in every language a characteristic world-view. As the individual sound stands between man and the object, so the entire language steps in between him and the nature that operates, both inwardly and outwardly, upon him... Man lives primarily with objects, [but]... he actually does so exclusively as language presents them to him" ([1836] 1988:60).
In this century the argument is most often associated with Benjamin Lee Whorf. For example, in one of his strongest statements, he proposed: "Users of markedly different grammars are pointed by their grammars towards different types of observations and different evaluations of externally similar acts of observation, and hence are not equivalent as observers but must arrive at somewhat different views of the world" ([1940a] 1956:221).
This doctrine of linguistic determinism, along with the facts of linguistic relativity, has clear implications not only for adult mental behavior, but also for the roles of language and thought in human development. It follows from the doctrine that children who learn different languages end up with differentsconceptual structures, and that these differences have pervasive cognitive effects. As Whorf put it:
70

From "thought and language" to "thinking for speaking"

71

"[E]very language is a vast pattern-system, different from others, in which are culturally ordained the forms and categories by which the personality not only communicates, but also analyzes nature, notices or neglects types of relationship and phenomena, channels his reasoning, and builds the house of his consciousness" ([1942] 1956:252)
In this chapter I propose to replace thought and language with a related but rather different pair of terms: thinking and speaking. The consequences of this shift from names of abstract entities to names of activities is to draw attention to the kinds of mental processes that occur during the act of formulating an utterance. Further, I want to focus attention just on those parts of utterances thai are required by the grammatical organization of the language. Here I am following a tradition in anthropological linguistics that has taken a less deterministic approach in the face of linguistic diversity, as exemplified by the thinking of Franz Boas. Roman Jakobson, in an article on "Boas' view of grammatical meaning," singles out Boas's observation that the set of obligatory grammatical categories of a language "determines those aspects of each experience that must be expressed" (Boas 1938:127). Von Humboldt's grand endeavor is thereby pared down to the issues of obligatoriness and expression. Whatever else language may do in human thought and action, it surely directs us to attend - while speaking - to the dimensions of experience that are enshrined in grammatical categories.
Boas, in his 1911 introduction to the Handbook of American Indian languages, catalogued a great diversity of obligatory grammatical categories across languages. For example, he discussed the English sentence, The man is sick, and noted that in Siouan one would have to indicate, grammatically, whether the man is moving or at rest; in Kwakiutl one would have to indicate whether the man in question is visible or non-visible to the speaker, and near to speaker, hearer, or a third person; whereas in Eskimo one would simply say 'man sick,' with no obligatory indication of definiteness, tense, visibility, or location. To remove Boas's examples from the realm of the exotic, note that in Spanish one has to indicate whether the man is temporarily or chronically sick; that in many European languages one cannot indicate deñnileness apart from gender; and so on. What Boas made of such diversity, however, is different from the suggestions of von Humboldt and Whorf:
The few examples that I have given here illustrate that many of the categories which we are inclined to consider as essential may be absent in foreign languages, and that other categories may occur as substitutes.
When we consider for a moment what this implies, it will be recognized that in each language only a part of the complete concept that we have in mind is expressed, and thai each language has a peculiar tendency to select this or that aspect of the mental image which is conveyed by the expression of the thought.
(Boas [1911] 1966:38-9)

72

Dan. I. Slobin

While von Humboldt and Whorf held that concepts have no existence independent of language, Boas suggests that there is a "complete concept," existing in the mind in the form of a "mental image." The obligatory grammatical categories of each language apparently sample from a universal form of mental representation, independent of any particular language. On this view, the task of the child language learner is to determine which "aspects of the mental image" are realized in the form of grammatical marking in the native language. The mental image is given prelinguistically, and language acquisition consists of learning which features to attend to.
Was Boas right? What would a "complete concept" or "mental image'* be like? Consider the two pictures presented in figures 3.1 and 3.2. These come from the middle of a picture storybook without words (Mayer 1969). My collaborators and I have given this book to children and adults in a number of languages and the present chapter is based on some of our results. For now, simply look at the two pictures. They present a pair of events that you can understand immediately, probably without talking to yourself at all: something happens to a boy and something happens to a dog; an owl and some bees or wasps are involved; the location is among trees. Consider the events of the second picture. What grammatical categories are implicit? Compare two languages of our crosslinguistic study, English and Spanish. As an English-speaker, it will be evident to you that the activity of the dog is durative, or extended in time, in

Fig. 3.1

From "thought and language" lo "thinking for speaking"

73

Fig. 3.2
comparison with the activity of the boy. In narrative mode, you might say: "The boy fell from the tree and the dog was running away from the bees." English marks progressive aspect on the verb, and il seems that this aspect corresponds to an obvious temporal component of the "complete concept" or "mental image." If you are a Spanish-speaker, you, too, will recognize the durativity of running, because Spanish also has progressive aspect, as well as imperfective aspect. Yet you might also note that the falling of the boy is punctual or completed, since Spanish makes a contrast between perfective and imperfective aspect. However, what if you speak a language that has no grammatical marking of perfective/im perfective or of progressive, such as German or Hebrew - to pick two more languages from our crosslinguistic study based on these pictures. Boas would presumably have suggested that you are aware of the differences in temporal contour between falling and running, but simply have no need to mark them grammatically in your language.
So far so good - but let us probe the second picture a bit further. Consider the owl as an observer. In an English narrative one might say: "The owl saw that the boy fell"; or: "The owl saw that the dog was running." The distinction between fell and was running, I have suggested, seems to be clearly "in" the picture. But what about the owl's seeing? Nole that, in both cases, in English we say "The owl saw." Yet seeing

74

Dan. I. Slobin

must have different temporal contours too. Indeed, in Spanish the seeing is perfective (PFV) in the first instance, imperfective(IPFV) in the second:

(1) a. El buho vio

que el niño se cayó.

the owl saw-PFV lhat the boy fell-PFV

b. El buho veta que el perro corría. the owl saw-IPFV that the dog ran-IPFV

This will be evident to Spanish-speaking readers, as it is to Spanishspeaking preschoolers in our study - in fact, these two sentences come from a story told by a five-year-old. Yet do English-speakers sense that seeing can be perfective or imperfective? Is this part of our Boasian "mental image" or "complete concept"? I rather doubt it.

Let me take you one step further, this time into a less familiar linguistic terrain. Suppose you have seen only the second picture, and have been asked to describe it as a past event. Descriptions in English and Spanish would probably be the same as in the situation in which both pictures are presented. However, this is not the case in Turkish - another language in our sample - because in that language you are obliged to choose between two past-tense inflections, one for witnessed and one for non-witnessed events. If the second picture were to be presented alone, we would witness the dog running, but we could only infer that the boy had fallen at an earlier point in time. As a consequence, different past tenses would appear on the two verbs:

(2) a. Kopek kap-iyor-du dog run-PROG-WITNESSED.PAST The dog was running.'
b. fcocuk dus-miis. boy fall-NONWITNESSED.PAST 'The boy (apparently) fell.'

Turkish preschoolers are careful to make such distinctions. In English one could say, of course, something like: "It seems that the boy fell" or "Apparently the boy fell." We do have available optional lexical means for expressing notions that lie outside of the set of obligatory grammatical
distinctions in a language. Nevertheless, I think we would be hardpressed to claim that everything about this picture that could be grammatically encoded in all of the languages of the world is implicitly present when we look at the picture.
The Turkish evidential inflections also demonstrate that much of grammar does not deal with mental images or perceivable reality at all. Rather, much of grammar marks distinctions that are relevant to discourse. When I speak Turkish, I must qualify my past-tense statements by telling you something about the source of my evidence.

point of view. For example, in English I might say, "The bees are chasing the dog" or "The dog is being chased by the bees." Neither of these viewpoints - active or passive - is in the percept. Active and passive constructions serve to organize the flow of information in connected discourse. Thus, even within a single language, grammar provides a set of options for schematizing experience for the purposes of verbal expression. Any utterance is multiply determined by what I have seen or experienced, my communicative purpose in telling you about it, and the distinctions that are embodied in my grammar.2
The world does not present "events" and "situations" to be encoded in language. Rather, experiences are filtered through language into verbalized events. A "verbalized event" is constructed on-line, in the process of speaking. Von Humboldt and Whorf and Boas were right in suggesting that the obligatory grammatical categories of a language play a role in this construction. The purpose of the research presented here is to demonstrate that, by the age of three or four, children acquiring different types of languages are influenced by such categories in verbalizing the events depicted in our storybook.
In making this claim, I wish to present a new version of the von Humboldt-Whorf position on linguistic relativity and determinism. Recall that those theorists were concerned to relate language to worldview or habitual thought. The classic position thus seeks to relate two static entities: language and thought. Language is the totality of structures described by linguists. But what is "thought" or "worldview"? The hypothesis has always run into trouble in attempts to determine the mental structures that underlie perception, reasoning, and habitual behavior - as measured outside of the contexts of verbal behavior. (Chapters in this volume, once again, point to the difficulties involved in trying to systematically formulate and lest such proposals.) I have a more cautious, but more manageable formulation - one that seeks to relate two dynamic entities: thinking and speaking. There is a special kind of thinking that is intimately tied to language - namely, the thinking that is carried out, on-line, in the process of speaking.3I believe that this is the sort of relation that Boas had in mind when he wrote about selecting aspects of mental images that are "conveyed by the expression of the thought." In a later formulation, he explicitly pointed to the role of communication: "In language, the experience to be communicated is classified from a number of distinct aspects" (1938:127) [emphasis added], Whorf, by contrast, clearly intended more. In the passage from 1942 quoted above, he says "not only communicates, but also..."
Boas was probably wrong, though, in supposing that all speakers, within and between languages, have a common "complete concept"; he was right, however, in suggesting that any utterance is a selective

76

Dan. I. Slobin

schematization of a concept - a schematizalion that is, in some way, dependent on the grammaticized meanings of the speaker's particular language, recruited for purposes of verbal expression.
The reader may have noticed that I have not yet mentioned the name Edward Sapir, which usually appears in references to the "Whorf-Sapir hypothesis." Sapir sometimes took the strong view associated with Whorf, but sometimes he suggested the more cautious version that guides my own research. For example, in an early formulation, Sapir, like Boas, pointed to the role of language in the expression of thought: "(The forms of each language] establish a definite relational feeling or attitude towards all possible contents of expression and, through them, towards all possible contents of experience, ¡n so far, of course, as experience is capable of expression in linguistic terms" ([1924] 1958:152) [emphasis added].
In my own formulation: the expression of experience in linguistic terms constitutes thinking for speaking - a special form of thought that is mobilized for communication. Whatever effects grammar may or may not have outside of the act of speaking, the sort of mental activity that goes on while formulating utterances is not trivial or obvious, and deserves our attention. We encounter the contents of the mind in a special way when they are being accessed for use. That is, the activity of thinking takes on a particular quality when it is employed in the activity of speaking. In the evanescent time frame of constructing utterances in discourse one fits one's thoughts into available linguistic frames. "Thinking for speaking" involves picking those characteristics of objects and events that (a) fit some conceptualization of the event, and (b) are readily encodable in the language.4 I propose thai, in acquiring a native language, the child learns particular ways or thinking for speaking.
How can this proposal be investigated? One way is to compare the ways in which speakers of different languages depict the same events in words. This approach is well known to students of translation, and there is a large and fascinating literature showing that translations of the same text cannot help bul add or remove nuances in accord with the characteristics of the given language (e.g. Brislin 1976, Maslov 1985, Nida 1964, Snell-Hornby 1988, Toury 1986). Informally, we have already encountered these issues in considering various descriptions of the two storybook pictures in several languages, and in Boas's American Indian translations of The man is sick. However, my major concern is with the possible cognitive effects of linguistic diversity in the course of child language development, where the method of comparative translation cannol be generally applied, because one cannot ask monolingual children to carry out translations oPa text. However, we can ask children in different countries to tell stories about the same sequence of

77

pictures and see if their stories differ consistently, depending on the language that they are speaking. This is the method we have been using in Berkeley, in collaboration with researchers in a number of countries, using the picture storybook, Frog, where are you? (Mayer 1969). For the purposes of the present argument, I compare children's descriptions of several scenes in several languages, focusing on expressions of temporal and spatial relations. The languages are English, German, Spanish, and Hebrew, and the ages sampled are preschool (three-five years), schoolage (nine years), and adult. Our findings suggest that even preschoolers give evidence of language-specific patterns of thinking for speaking, and that such patterns have implications for the development of rhetorical style in each of the languages.5

1 Rhetorical style
When one has read many of these stories in various languages, one begins to get a feeling for typical characteristics of style in each language. This can be made clear even by comparing translations into English. Consider the two pictures that we have already examined, along with the seven following pictures in the storybook: after the boy falls from the tree, he accidentally gets entangled in the antlers of a deer, with the result that the boy and dog fall into some water. The two following segments are representative of five-year-olds' narratives. One is in English, and the other is an English translation of a Spanish story, using the progressive to correspond to the original imperfective, which has no English equivalent, in order to render the version suitable in English:
(3) a. First version: The boy looked in a hole in the tree. An owl came out that threw the boy. And the dog, the wasps were chasing him. The boy hid behind a rock and the owl flew away. A deer that was behind the boy when he climbed... And he slipped on top of the- the deer, while the deer was running. The dog went first. He threw them down where there was a river. Then he fell.
b. Second version: And the boy looked in the tree. And then the boy fell out, and the owl wasflying,and the dog was being chased by the bees. And then the boy gol up on some rocks, and the owl flew away. And the boy was calling for his frog on the rocks. And a deer... the boy got caught on the deer's antlers. And then the deer carried him over a cliff and threw him over the cliff into a pond. And the boy and the dog fell, and they splashed in some water.
We can be reasonably sure that the mental images, and understanding of the events, are roughly the same for these two children. Yet, to the practiced eye, it is evident that the first version is Spanish and the second English. What are some of the salient characteristics of these two languages, as reflected in our narratives?6

78

Dan. I, Slobin

The two versions are similar in their treatments of movement through time. Both narratives mark some events as being in progress. In the first, compare: threw vs. was running; in the second, fell vs. wasflying.(Recall that these past progressives in the translated version were really past imperfectives in the Spanish original.) English and Spanish both have aspectual marking of durativity, and five-year-olds note this distinction. As we will see later, this feature is lacking in German and Hebrew narratives.
The two versions differ, however, in their treatment of location and movement through space. In the first version, trajectories are not highly elaborated: threw the boy, slipped on top of the deer, threw down. The second version depicts more detailed trajectories:^// out, carried over a cliff, threw over the cliff into a pond, splashed in some water. By contrast, the first version has relative clauses that depict static locative configurations, which are lacking in the second: a deer that was behind the boy, where there was a river. In terms of syntactic complexity, although the second version has no relative clauses, it has passive constructions, was being chased, got caught.
These cues are sufficient to identify the first version as Spanish and the second as English. The linguistic characteristics of these two narrative segments are typical of our preschool narratives in the two languages. In brief, where English allows for elaborated trajectories of motion, Spanish has simple verbs of change of location, supplemented by more elaborated descriptions of static locations of objects. With regard to the syntax of non-canonical clauses. Spanish preschoolers make frequent use of relative clauses, and English-speaking preschoolers make frequent use of passives - but for different purposes, of course. Spanish relative clauses fill in locative and circumstantial detail in cases where English may not have need for such detail, as discussed below with some additional examples. English passives perform the same narrative function as Spanish word-order variation. I have given a left dislocation in the Spanish version: the dog, the wasps were chasing him. This was really a standard object-fronting word order in Spanish

(4) Le

perseguían al

perro las avispas.

CLITiC.PRO chased OBJECT + the dog the wasps

This corresponds in function to the English passive, the dog was being chased by the bees. Preschoolers in both languages can manipulate word order to topicalize a patient, although the construction types differ.
I want to argue that these systematic contrasts between Spanish and English reflect different patterns of thinking for speaking - different online organization of the flow of information and attention to the particular details that receive linguistic expression. These patterns hold

up in quantitative analysis of our narratives, and show striking contrasts with languages of different types.

2 Temporal description

Consider, again, the scene in which the boy falls from the tree and the bees chase the dog. Here we have two simultaneous events, one PUNCTUAL, COMPLETED, and the other NON-PUNCTUAL, DURATIVE. As we have seen, English allows for an opposition between an aspeclually neutral verb form and a progressive, with the neutral form taking on a default punctual value, given the lexical meaning of the verb fall. The description in ourfive-year-okTsexample is typical:

(5) The boy fell o u t . . . and the dog was being chased by the bees.

Such aspectual contrasts are available at even younger ages. The earliest example in our data for this scene is given by a child of 3;8 (3 years 8 months):

(6) He's [dog] running through there, and he [boy] fell off.

In Spanish, the preferred version is to mark the punctuality of falling by use of a perfective verb form, contrasting it either with an imperfective or a gerundive expression, as in the following five-year-old's examples:

(7) a. Se

cayó el niño y ¡e

perseguían al perro ¡as avispas.

The boy fell-PFV and the wasps chased-IPFV the dog.'

b. Se cayó ... y el perro salió corriendo. 'He fell-PFV... and the dog came-out-PFV running.'

As in English, this aspectual contrast is marked by the youngest children in our sample. Our earliest Spanish example comes from a child of 3;4:

(8) Se cayó...

El perro está corriendo.

*He fell-PFV... The dog is running.'

Spanish, by providing a perfective, in addition to imperfective and progressive, thus makes it possible to grammatically mark both poles of the durative-nondurative distinction, whereas the English progressive provides explicit marking only of the durative pole.7
German and Hebrew lack distinctive marking of either pole of the aspectual contrast. Hebrew has no grammaticized aspect at all. Verbs are simply inflected for past, present, or future tense. German has a simple past and a perfect. Neither language has grammatical marking of either progressive or imperfective. One would assume that German- and Hebrew-speakers must be aware, in some non-linguislic sense, that the temporal contours of the two events differ. In Boas's terms, their mental

80

Dan. I. Slobin

images should include such a basic contrast. Yet, the obligatory grammatical categories of German and Hebrew do not require speakers to attend to this contrast. This is evident in the narratives in these two languages: speakers generally do not distinguish the two events grammatically, but rather tend to use the same tense for both verbs. The following examples from five-year-olds are typical:
(9) German:
Der Junge fällt vom Bourn runter... und die Bienen gehen hinter dem Hund her. 'The boy falls down from the tree... and the bees go after the dog.'
(10) Hebrew: Hu nafal ve hakelev barax. 'He fell and the dog ran-away.'
These examples are from five-year-olds, but ¡t is important to note that the language-specific patterns hold across all the ages sampled, from three to nine, and for adults. In German and Hebrew the tendency is to maintain the same tense-aspect form for both clauses, while in Spanish and English the tendency is to differentiate the two. The trend is summarized numerically in table 3.1.
Consider these figures in the light of thinking for speaking. If the figures for Hebrew and German were uniformly 100%, and for English and Spanish 0%, we could only conclude that speakers strictly adhere to the formal contrasts provided by their language, and it would not be possible to separate thinking from speaking. Critical evidence, however, comes from deviations from these extremes, indicating that other options are possible.
Some Hebrew speakers try to contrast the two events by presenting the first in the past tense and the second in the present, thereby recruiting a tense difference to mark the aspectual contrast COMPLETEDONGOING. For example:
(11) Hebrew (5-year-old): Hayeled nafal... ve hakelev boreax. 'The boy fell... and the dog runs-away.'

From "thought and language" to "thinking for speaking" 81
Note that this option is used about one-third of the time by preschoolers and adults, while school-age children (nine-year-olds) follow the language most tenaciously in not attempting any aspectual distinction. (It is worth noting, in passing, that nine-year-olds' stories, across languages, tend to be the most stereotyped and consistent with native language patterns. This may well be an effect of schooling.)
German presents a similar picture to Hebrew. There are some attempts to mark the verbs differently, especially in preschool narratives. The first event is sometimes put in the perfect, thereby closing it off as a resultant stale with regard to the second event in the present tense. For example:
(12) German (5-year-old): Der ist vom Baum runtergefallen und der Hund läuft schnell weg. 'He has fallen down from the tree and the dog runs away quickly.'
It is interesting that the tendency in German is to mark the first event as completed, rather than to elaborate the second as ongoing. Only two narrators in our total sample of forty-eight made any attempt to mark the second event as protracted in time:
(13) a. German (9-year-old): Er rannte schneller und immer schneller. 'He ran faster and ever fasler.'
b. German (adult): Der Hund rennt rennt rennt. The dog runs runs runs.1
In fact, throughout the narratives, it is generally ihe case that when German speakers choose to take an aspectual perspective, they lend to orient to some marking of boundedness. It is intriguing that, in the history of German, there have been various attempts to grammaticize notions of boundedness or terminative aspect. English, by contrast, has gone in a different historical direction among the Germanic languages, grammaticizing the progressive. And wefindthat our English-speaking narratives tend to mark durativity more than termination in their descriptions. The relations between diachrony and child language would require a separate paper. However, it is worth noting that persistence of a grammaticized notion over time in the history of a language provides another sort of critical evidence that grammatical distinctions may train children to attend to particular "contents of expression," to use Sapir's term. Thai is to say, speakers - and hence languages - become accustomed to maintaining grammatical marking of particular semantic features, as shown in ample diachronic evidence of renovation of grammatical markers within a given semantic domain.
To return to the fates of the boy and the dog: it is important for my argument that thefiguresin table 3.1 are not all 100s and 0s. If this were

82

Dan. I. Slobin

the case, one could only conclude, with Whorf ([1940b] 1956:213-14), that:
We cut nature up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this way - an agreement (hat holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of our language. The agreement is, of course, an implicit and unstated one. but Us terms are absolutely obligatory [Whorfs emphasis], we cannot talk at all except by subscribing to the organization and classification of dala which the agreement decrees.
The deviations from the overall tendencies of each language type show that the "agreement" is not totally obligatory: it is, indeed, possible to try to mark aspectual notions like TERMÍNATIVE and DURATIVE if they are not part of the regular system of verb morphology in one's language, as in German and Hebrew. On the other, the occasional lack of aspectual distinctions between the two clauses in Spanish and English shows that one is not compelled to make use of the full array of distinctions available in verbal morphology. However, what is most striking in table 3.1 is the finding that speakers so rarely make use of options that differ from the norm. Overall, Hebrew and German speakers attempt to elaborate aspectual distinctions about one-quarter of the time, while Spanish and English speakers fail to mark aspectual distinctions about one quarter of the lime. Such tendencies appear repeatedly, throughout our crosslinguistic study of narrative, clearly pointing to different types of thinking for speaking. Speakers of all ages, across languages, certainly know, in some non-linguistic sense, that the boy's falling is punctual and completed with regard to the simultaneous, ongoing chasing and running of bees and dog. Yet they generally do not seem to be inclined to express any more of this knowledge linguistically than fits the available distinctions in the language. It is striking that children as young as three already show the "selective attention" favored by their particular native language.
In comparing languages in terms of grammatical aspect, as in the examples presented above, we find differences in terms of the number and kinds of distinctions that are marked. The four languages we have considered can be put on a continuum with regard to richness of aspectual inflection:
Grammatical aspect
Hebrew: none. German: perfect English: perfect, progressive Spanish: perfect, progressive, imperfect i ve/perfect i ve
When dealing with a continuum of this so>t, we ask whether there is any sort of "compensation" for missing grammatical categories in a language,

Front "thought and language" to "thinking for speaking"

83

or whether they are generally ignored in thinking for speaking. Our data - across a number of story episodes and languages - suggest that categories that are not grammaticized in the native language are generally ignored, whereas those that are grammaticized are all expressed by children as young as three.

3 Spatial description
Languages differ from one another not only in the presence or absence of a grammatical category, but also in the ways in which they allocate grammatical resources to common semantic domains. Again, it will be most useful to begin with a comparison between English and Spanish. These two languages represent opposite poles of a typological distinction with regard to the verbal expression of change of location. That is, they differ critically in lexicalization patterns for verbs of motion. Consider one of the sentences we encountered earlier in an English five-year-old's story:
(14) And then the deer carried him over a cliff and threw him over the cliff into a pond.
As Leonard Talmy (1985) has shown in detailed analyses of lexicalization patterns, the verb in English encodes some change of location in a particular manner - throw, carry, run, etc. - leaving it to particles and prepositions to encode directionality. English allows for quite elaborated use of such means to specify path with a single verb root. The following sentence sounds quite normal to native speakers:
(15) The bird flew down from out of the hole in the tree
The verb simply specifies motion in a particular manner, and the associated elements specify the trajectory: down-from-out-of.
Spanish verbs of motion encode either directionality - entrar, 'enter'; salir, 'exit*; subir, 'ascend'; bajar, 'descend', etc.; or manner - volar, 'fly'; correr, 'run'. However, one cannot compactly express manner and directionality in compound expressions as in English, because the grammar generally does not allow for the accumulation of path expressions. The closesl Spanish approximation to (IS) would be something like:
(16) El pájaro salió del agujero del árbol volando hacia abajo.
'The bird exited of the hole of the tree flying towards below.'
Note that Spanish prepositions, by contrast to English, provide minimal locative specification: de occurs twice in example (16). In del agujero, 'of the hole/ it receives the meaning 'out-of' from the associated verb saliry 'exit,' while in del árbol, 'of the tree/ it receives the meaning 'in* from

84

Dan. I. Slobin

general world knowledge about relations between holes and trees. When world knowledge is not sufficient, the Spanish-speaker is often required to provide a static "sketch" of the relevant components of the scene, so that the appropriate trajectory can be inferred. This accounts, in part, for the flowering of relative clauses in Spanish. For example, in English one might say:
(17) The boy put the frog down into a jar.
A Spanish-speaker might say:
(18) El niño metió la rana en el frasco que había abajo. 'The boy inserted the frog en [=¡n/on] the jar that was below.*
The verb meter, 'insert,* implies that the proposition en is to be interpreted as 'in'; and the relative clause, que había abajo, 'that was below,* implies the directionality of insertion. Thus in Spanish the trajectory 'down-into' must be inferred from a combination of path-verb and a static description of the location of the goal - the jar - while in English the static location of the goal - located in the jar - must be inferred from the path-description, down into.
This is a systematic difference between the two languages. English tends to assert trajectories, leaving resultant locative states to be inferred; Spanish tends to assert locations and directions, leaving trajectories to be inferred. This systematic difference has effects on the grammar of discourse. One effect, already mentioned, is the Spanish use of locative relative clauses. Another effect is in the use of Spanish participles, which are frequent at the youngest ages. There are even clauses in which the only lexical verb is a parliciple. For example, where English-speakers tend to say "The boy climbed the tree," leaving the boy's end-state implicit, Spanish speakers often say the untranslatable EI niño está subido en el árbol 'the boy is climb-PART in the tree.'
(19) English: assert trajectory, imply end-state. The boy climbed the tree.
(20) Spanish: assert end-stale, imply trajectory. El niño está subido en el árbol. 'the boy is climb-PART en [=in/on] the tree.' [= the boy is in a stale of having climbed the tree]
The languages incline towards different patterns in what is asserted and what is implied. Thus, at many points in our narratives, English-speakers assert actions, implying results, whereas Spanish-speakers assert results, implying actions. These differences come to have an effect on overall rhetorical style. Thus the obligatory grammatical morphemes of a language may do more than simply direct attention-while-speaking to their semantic content. This directed attention may have consequences

From "thought and language" to "thinking for speaking" 85
for what is said and unsaid in any particular language. In this case, English-speaking narrators devote somewhat more narrative attention to descriptions of processes, while Spanish-speaking narrators tend to provide more descriptions of states. (In making this proposal, however, let me underline that I am talking about thinking for speaking only. I am making no claims about how millions of Spanish- and English-speakers conceive of life or act in the world.)
In our small sample of narratives to the Frog, where are you? picturebook, there are some suggestive differences by age and language with respect to the sorts of issues of location and motion that we have been examining. The analysis of verbs of motion can be enriched by adding German and Hebrew, since German patterns itself like English with undirected verbs of motion and a rich and differentiated collection of locative particles and prepositions - and Hebrew patterns itself like Spanish - with directional verbs and a small collection of polysemous prepositions.
There are three episodes in the story in which a character falls or is thrown downward. We have seen two of them - the fall from the tree and the fall from the cliff; and here we add a third, in which the dog falls from a window. The analysis includes all of the verbs used to describe these scenes (mainly versions of "fall" and "throw") in English, German, Spanish, and Hebrew. At issue is whether the verb occurred alone or with some kind of locative addition - a particle or prepositional phrase indicating downward direction, source, or goal of motion. Table 3.2 presents the data for three-, five-, and nine-year-olds, giving the percentages of such descriptions that had a bare verb with no locative elaboration.
First consider the three-year o Ids. It is already evident that English and German form one group, and Spanish and Hebrew another. Recall that, in comparing languages according to aspect, it was English and Spanish

that formed one group, and German and Hebrew another. It is clear that, for psycholinguistic purposes, typological differences between languages must be considered separately for each semantic domain. The ways in which a language deals with issues of time may be quite different from its treatment of space, which casts some doubt on the grand overall conceptions of language and world-view proposed by von Humboldt and Whorf.
Table 3.2 shows that English and German three-year-olds hardly ever use a verb of motion without some locative elaboration, whereas Spanish and Hebrew three-year-olds use bare verbs of motion about two-thirds of the time. This clear difference in narrative strategy holds up across age as well. Although there are different developmental patterns, at each of the three ages the contrast between the two types of languages is maintained.8
The most interesting developmental pattern is seen in Spanish. Here there appears to be a U-shaped curve, with some five-year-olds providing relatively more locative elaboration than either three- or nine-year-olds. Some children of this age seem to be groping for more detailed description of trajectories, using English/German construction types that are redundant in Spanish; for example:
(21) a. Se cayó dentro de un agujero. '(He) fell inside or a hole.' [5 yrs.] [=Se cayó en un agujero '(He) fell en a hole.']
b. Se cayó encima del agua. '(He) fell on top of the water.* [5 yrs.] [=Se cayó al agua. '(He) fell a the water.*]
And some five-year-olds add a locative adverb, abajo 'down' or 'downward,' as in:
(21) c. Le tiró abajo. '(He) threw him down(ward).' (5 yrs.]
These can be looked upon as attempts to compensate for an apparent gap in Spanish grammar. Yet they are different from the attempts at compensation that we encountered with regard to verbal aspect. There we found a few rare instances of German and Hebrew attempts to add distinctions of punctuality or durativity that are not marked grammatically in the language. Here, however, we have attempts to be more explicit, using tools that are part of the grammar. Again, we see that thinking for speaking is not a Whorfian straightjackel.
Interestingly, these attempts disappear after the age of five in Spanish. They seem to be replaced by the use of extended static locative descriptions, which make it possible to infer trajectories from the combination of a motion verb and the description of a scene. That is, the

From "thought and language" to "thinking for speaking"

87

Spanish child learns to allocate information in accordance with the "rhetorical typology" of the language. The following nine-year-old's example is typical:
(22) El ciervo le llevó hasta un sitio, donde debajo había un río. Entonces el ciervo tiró al perro y al niño ai rio. Y después, cayeron. 'The deer took him until a place, where below there was a river. Then the deer threw the dog and the boy to the river. And then, they fell.'
The four languages also fall into two types on the basis of relative use of such locative description. Table 3.3 summarizes the use of elaborated locative narration of the fall from the cliff.
First compare English and Spanish: it is evident that this pattern of extended Locative elaboration develops between the ages of five and nine in Spanish, but not in English. Comparable narrations by English nineyear-olds present compact phrases with verbs of motion and associated indications of path, but with no scene-setting descriptions, such as:
(23) a. So the deer ran away with him and dropped him off a cliff in the water. And they fell in the water.
b. And the deer ran with the boy on his antlers. So the dog was chasing the deer, and the deer just stopped, and the boy and the dog fell off a cliff into a swamp.
German nine-year-olds are strikingly similar to English-speaking Americans, with little static scene-setting and compact verbal constructions that sketch out a trajectory; for example:
(24) Der Hirsch nahm den Jungen auf sein Geweih und schmiß ihn den Abhang hinunter genau ins Wasser. 'The deer took the boy on his antlers and hurled him down from the cliff right into the water.'

Finally, to complete the picture, nine-year-old Israelis are strikingly similar to Spaniards, as can be seen from the following Hebrew example:
(25) Ve ha'ayil nivhai ve hu hitxil laruts. Ve hakeiev rats axarav, ve hu higia lemacak she mitaxat haya bitsa. ve hu atsar, ve hayeled ve hakeiev nafiu labitsa beyaxad. 'And the deer was startled, and he began to run. And the dog ran after him, and he reached a cliff that had a swamp underneath, and he stopped, and the boy and the dog fell to the swamp together.'
To return to the overall theme once again, the contrast between these two types of languages seems to have important consequences with regard to thinking for speaking. In this instance, the unavailability of a particular grammatical device - a system of locative particles related to verbs - has rather large potential consequences for narrative organization. Spanish- and Hebrew-speaking children develop procedures of scene-setting in which a vaguely specified change of location becomes interpretable in context. One grammatical device which serves this function is relative clauses, and we find that Spanish- and Hebrewspeakers use relative clauses far more frequently than English- and German-speakers. This is already evident at the age of three, indicating early development of a narrative style in which description and qualification are important (Berman & Slobin 1994).

4 Learning to think for speaking
One must, of course, be cautious in making large generalizations from a rather small sample of stories told about a single picturebook in several countries. Within this framework, however, it is encouraging to find that the patterns we have found in Spain seem to hold up in comparable data gathered by Aura Bocaz in Chile and Argentina (Slobin & Bocaz 1988), and that the English patterns are repeated in several different American samples. Much more needs to be done even with the Frog, where are you? picturebook in the remaining languages in our sample, not to mention necessary additions of other genres and languages.9
I am convinced, however, that the events of this little picture book are experienced differently by speakers of different languages - in the process of making a verbalized story out of them. For example, there is nothing in the pictures themselves that leads English speakers to verbally express whether an event is in progress, or Spanish speakers to note whether it has been completed; to encourage Germanic speakers to formulate elaborate descriptions of trajectories; to make Hebrew speakers indifferent to conceiving of events as durative or bounded in time. (And, if we were to go on to examine our Russian and Turkish stories, we would find an indifference to indicating the definí teness of story participants - a

category readily marked by our English, German, Spanish, and Hebrew narrators.) I suggest that, in acquiring each of these languages, children are guided by the set of grammaticized distinctions in the language to attend to such features of events while speaking.10
5 First-language thinking in second-language speaking
There is something dissatisfying in limiting ourselves to evidence that is so bound up with the acquisition and use of native languages. I have also suggested that the stability of grammaticized categories in historical language change can be taken as evidence of the cognitive importance of those categories for speakers. In conclusion, I would like to point to another type ofevidence that seems to support my proposal that the ways one learns a language as a child constrain one's sensitivity to what Sapir called "the possible contents of experience as experienced in linguistic terms."
Consider the small collection of linguistically encoded perspectives that we have been examining: temporal contours of events marked by aspectual forms, movement and trajectories in space (and also indication of definiteness of participants mentioned in connected discourse). These are precisely the sorts of things that make it so hard to master the grammar of a second language. For example, it is very hard for Englishspeakers to grasp the Spanish perfective/imperfeclive distinction that is lacking in our native language. In fact, we seem never to master this system fully in Spanish. By contrast, we have little difficulty in figuring out how to use the Spanish progressive and perfect, or the Spanish definite and indefinite articles - since we have already learned how to make decisions about the linguistic expression of these notions in English. Yet there is nothing inherently easy or hard about any of these Spanish distinctions. For example, native French speakers have no trouble with the Spanish imperfective, since they have a similar category in French; but the progressive and perfect pose problems to them, since these are not French ways of looking at events. Turkish speakers have difficulty with definite and indefinite articles in learning to speak Spanish, English, and German, since there are no definite articles in Turkish. German speakers of English use the progressive where they should use simple present, although Turks do not make this error in English, since Turkish uses progressive aspect and German does not. Spanish learners of English object that we make too many obscure distinctions with our large collection of locative prepositions and particles. And so on. In brief, each native language has trained its speakers to pay different kinds of attention to events and experiences when talking about them. This training is carried out in childhood and is exceptionally resistant to restructuring in adult second-language acquisition.

Much of value for the thinking for speaking hypothesis could be learned from a systematic study of those systems in particular second languages that speakers of particular first languages find especially difficult to master. Suggestive data of precisely this sort come from a European Science Foundation project, "Second language acquisition by adult immigrants" (Perdue 1993). Two examples, one from the domain of time and the other from the domain of space, are instructive.
Consider Italian- and Punjabi-speaking immigrants to Britain (Bhardwaj, Dietrich, & Noyau 1988). Italian and English are both "tense-prominent" languages - that is, every finite clause must be grammatically marked as to its deictic relation to the moment of speaking. Italian immigrants readily acquire English pasl-tense forms. This makes it possible for them to construct narratives from a situationally external perspective, relating a succession of past events as seen from the present, as is done in Italian. These speakers make far more frequent use of tense-marking than of the English progressive aspect. Punjabi, by contrast, is an "aspect-prominent" language, and Punjabi immigrants make heavy use of the English progressive to narrate events "from within," from the perspective of the protagonist, in analogous fashion to the narrative use of the Punjabi imperfective.
In the domain of space the influence of Punjabi on learners' early organization of English is striking (Becker, Carroll, & Kelly 1988). In Punjabi, spatial locations are regions named by nouns, analogous to English expressions such as on the top of the pile and at the back of the house. Punjabi learners of English often treat prepositions as nouns, producing forms such as put the on please, put the down chair, and pull the up (1988:69). English relational terms have apparently been reanalyzed as names of locations. In addition, Punjabi focuses on states as the results of processes (somewhat like the Spanish use of participles discussed above). This pattern also transfers to English. For example, a newspaper lying on a table is referred to as put in the table by a Punjabi-speaker. The investigators suggest that "he imagines that the newspaper was put there by someone. In Punjabi one says exactly the same thing" (1988:73).
The European Science Foundation team concludes:

The influence of the lexico-grammalical systems of both the SL [source language]

and the TL (target language] can be observed in the acquisition process. The

picture which emerges is quite a simple one - an adult acquirer tries to discover in

ihe TL a system thai is similar to lhat of his SL, and if he does not discover any,

he tries to construct one; but since it is the TL material he has to use the outcome

is invariably a hybrid which is an autonomous system (often consisting of loosely

or tightly integrated sub-systems) which partakes of some features of both the

"parent" systems but is identical to neither.

(Bhardwaj et al. 1988:86)

From "thought and language" to "thinking for speaking"

91

I propose that the grammaticized categories that are most susceptible to SL influence have something important in common: they cannot be experienced directly in our perceptual, sensorimotor, and practical dealings with the world. To be sure, all human beings experience sequences of events that have particular temporal contours, put objects in locations, and so on. Indeed, animals do the same. However, only language requires us to categorize events as ongoing or completed, objects as at rest or as at the end point of a trajectory, and so forth. Other categories seem to be less dependent on purely verbal categorization. I would imagine, for example, that if your language lacked a plural marker, you would not have insurmountable difficulty in learning to mark the category of plurality in a second language, since this concept is evident to the nonlinguistic mind and eye. Or if your language lacked an instrumental marker it should not be difficult to learn to add a grammatical inflection to nouns that name objects manipulated as instruments. Plurality and manipulation are notions that are obvious to the senses." Yet there is nothing in everyday sensorimotor interactions with the world that changes when you describe an event as "She went to work" or "She has gone to work," or when you refer to the same object in successive utterances as "a car" and "the car." Distinctions of aspect, definiteness, voice, and the like, are, par excellence, distinctions that can only be learned through language, and have no other use except to be expressed in language. They are not categories of thought in general, but categories of thinking for speaking. It seems that once our minds have been trained in taking particular points of view for the purposes of speaking, it is exceptionally difficult for us to be retrained.
It is interesting that Wilhelm von Humboldt anticipated these questions as well. He wrote:
To learn a foreign Language should therefore be to acquire a new standpoint in the world-view hitherto possessed, and in fact to a certain extent this is so, since every language contains the whole conceptual fabric and mode of presentation of a portion of mankind. But because we always carry over, more or less, our own world-view, and even our own language-view, this outcome is not purely and completely experienced. ([1836] 1988:60)

6 Conclusion
In sum, we can only talk and understand one another in terms of a particular language. The language or languages that we learn in childhood are not neutral coding systems of an objective reality. Rather, each one is a subjective orientation to the world of human experience, and this orientation affects the ways in which we think while we are speaking.

2 These facts pose problems for any acquisition theory, because the child must initially be sensitive to potentially grammaticizable distinctions. This problem goes beyond the goals of the present chapter. For discussion of these issues see Bowerman (1989), Pinker (1989), Talmy (1987), Slobin (1985).
3 My preferred formulation of a modified Whorfian hypothesis was offered by Charles Hockett: "The impact of an inherited linguistic pattern on activities is, in general, least important in the most practical contexts and most important in such 'purely verbal' goings-on as storytelling, religion, and philosophizing" (1954:122). I would extend the definition of these "purely verbal goings-on" to all acts of speaking.
4 For the purposes of this chapter, ''readily encodable in the language" is limited to closed-class grammatical morphemes - specifically, tense/aspect inflections, verb particles, and prepositions. Traditionally, the hypothesis of linguistic relativity and determinism has been most clearly stated with regard to obligatory distinctions as well as to the number of options provided by a language within a domain. For example, tense is obligatory in English but modality is optional. Nevertheless, the language provides a
