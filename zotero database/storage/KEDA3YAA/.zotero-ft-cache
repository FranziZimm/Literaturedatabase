INTRODUCTION.
The Athapascan languages of the North are usually referr3cd to as the Dene from the word which in many dialects means a man who sp3aks that tongue. It is in the North that we find the largest continuous territory occupied by these people. They have all of the continent north of the ChurchiU and Peace Rivers on the east side of the Rocky Mountains and on the western side of these mountains, the territory as far south as 57' 39' except that in all parts the Eskimo and other tribes hold the coast. It remains to be determined how many languages and dialects are spoken in this territory and the degree of their relationship.
The Chipewyan are in the southeastern portion of this territory alo ig the Athabaska River and Lake and the lakes and streams draining into the Churchill River. There are minor dialectic variations within this area but no thorough study of them has been made.
The Chipewyan language has been treated by Petitot in his Dictionaire de la langue De'n6-Dindjie I which includes the Chipewyan. This work ha3 a comparative grammar of the Mackenzie languages in the introduction and tables of conjugations as a supplement. Father Petitot has also published a text of Chipewyan in "Traditions indienne3 du Canada Nord-Oae3t." 2
Father Laurent Le Goff who has been with the3e people for forty-five years has published a number of books in Chipewyan, using both the syllabic
characters and the Roman alphabet, for the use of his parishioners and co-
workers. Of particular interest is his "Grammaire Montagnaise ou Chip-
peweyane" published in 1887. It is also pleasing to know that Father
Le Goff has a voluminous dictionary in mnanuscript which he hope3 to
publish shortly.
To Father Le Goff and his friends the writer wishes to apologize for his entry upon this field and for this publication put forth after so short a study of the dialect. The chief purpose of the visit was to actually hear a Dene language in order to have a conception of the sounds used that a comparison with the other Athapascan languages, particularly those of the Pacific Coast and the Southwest, might be made.
This paper has been prepared as a result, hoping that the description of the sounds of the language, somewhat more detailed than Father Le Goff has

given, and the illustrative tracings and comparative references to the other groups may prove of value. The material furnished by the texts of the
preceding number of this volume and word lists has been analyzed and
presented in the order followed in the Hupa I and Kato 2 languages. It will only be necessary to place corresponding sections of these papers and the present one side by side to obtain a comparative view of their relationship..
It is desired to call attention here to the large number of simple substantive elements, monosyllabic nouns, names of parts of the body, terms of relationship, etc., which occur also either on the Pacific Coast or in the Squthwest. Of the verbal elements not only are most of the prefixes and stems common to other regions but complex and phonetically modified forms are easily traceable.
It is the phonetic changes that make the language nearly unintelligible to one knowing only southern dialects. The chief difference is in the presence of surd, sonant, and glottally affected th (t7, 0, 0') where most of the Pacific and the Southern dialects have surd, sonant, and glottally affected tongue point consonants (z, s, ts, ts'). The sonant stops also are fully sonant instead of intermediate and are lightly articulated approaching continuants.
There occur in the Chipewyan both nouns and verbs for which the people of California and Arizona would have little use, such as e 0fn, caribou; de ni, moose; Eai', snowshoes; na tse de,, to chisel for beaver. It may be possible in the future to show that the natural features of the north are provided with simple definite names and terms while those peculiar to the south have compound names and new formations, or the reverse. If any preponderance of simplicity should be shown to exist in favor of one locality, the argument would be a strong one that migrations originated in that quarter.

PHONETICS.
TRACINGS.
Those unfamiliar with the apparatus and work of Rousselot will find a brief description of the method in the American Anthropologist.' A kymograph is used with a horizontal cylinder 25 cm. long and 13' cm. in diameter driven by a spring clock at a speed of 7 revolutions a minute. White paper is put about this cylinder and given a thin coat of smoke with a candle. A light flexible horn point rests on this paper and moves to the right or left on the end of a lever which is attached to the center of a rubber tambour. For breath tracings a mouthpiece is held rather firmly to the lips and the full force of the emitted breath sent through a tube to the tambour. Variations in the force of the breath are shown by the major movement of the tracing point while the vocal murmur is represented by the fine regular vibrations. The closures of stop consonants are shown by the low straight horizontal lines; the releases by the vertical lines; aspiration by a continued high elevation; and glottal affection by sudden retraction. The continuant consonants result in varying curved elevations, smooth when surd, and with superimposed vibrations when sonant. The liquid r shows coarse vibrations caused by the movement of the tongue tip. The sonant 1 has one such movement only. The vowels have strong regular vibrations on lines rising, falling, or straight, according to adjoining consonants and varying stress. The semi-vowels usually show less prominent vibrations and less elevated lines.
It is probable that even in these tracings change in pitch can be measured by counting and comparing the number of vibrations in given lengths of the lines. Stress would be shown, other conditions being equal, by the elevation of the line since the tracing point goes higher with greater strength of the breath but this force of the air column is dependent upon the configuration of the mouth and the degree of the opening of the glottis. It is only possible then to judge stress when the same sound occurs in the syllables under consideration. The duration or length of the sounds may be measured by

referring to the base line drawn by revolving the cylinder before removing the paper. This line has 49 mm. to a second of time or about .02 seconds to a millimeter.
The tracings were made from Jean Baptise Ennou, at Lloydminster, Saskatchewan in a single day. The apparatus arrived in bad condition but after repairs were made, proved to be available for the use desired. The speed in particular seemed to be reliable. Rousselet tambours 2 cm. in diameter freshly covered with good rubber were used; the Marey tambours of 5 cm. proving unsuitable.
Figs. 1 to 26 were made to show the degree of sonancy; a second tambour, having attachment to the larynx furnished a synchronous tracing uninterfered with by mouth movements. In Figs. 5, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18, 21, 25, and 26 the larynx tracing is below and the breath tracing above. In the remainder the breath tracing is below. Tracings from the nose to show the nasalization of the vowels were attempted but proper adjustment could not be secured in the time available.
The numerous breath tracings were selected to illustrate the more important words and elements in the dialect. They should prove valuable in distinguishing the sonant, aspirated surd, and glottally affected surd stops, the sonancy of the continuants, and the duration of all the sounds. Comparison with published tracings of Hupa I and Kato 2 words will show interesting similarities and differences.
VOWELS.3
The original, underived vowels appear to be Italian a, open e, closed or continental l, closed o, and closed u. Besides these a closed e occurs, perhaps influenced by neighboring closed sounds like y; an open i, short -and occurring only in closed syllables; and a neutral Ai which seems usually to represent a, but sometimes i. These vowels occur as nasal as well as oral sounds. The nasality is always due to the absorption of n which originally followed the vowel and which reappears when in the word structure a vowel follows, or when the utterance is deliberate. There was no opportunity for a graphic study of vowels except as they are represented in the tracings where they are available for a study of length only.

SEMI-VOWELS.
The semi-vowels y and w both occur, the former rather frequently, but the latter only under such circumstances as to point to fully sonant g as its origin. This is brought about by the neighborhood of a rounded vowel, o or u. Often y has somewhat of a spirant sound especially in its earlier portion. Tracings of intervocalic y show a definite weakening of the vibrations and sometimes a bodily lowering of the line, due no doubt to the constriction of the mouth passage. (Figs. 1-3, 74, 81, 201.)
NASALS.
The most frequently occurring nasal is n, which is found initially, between vowels, and. finally (Figs. 7, 25). In the last position it often disappears, resulting in a nasal vowel. In other cases it is preserved, but no reason for these differing results has been found. In many cases the glottal stop follows n written ne, but perhaps might have been written as consistently n' (Fig. 20). When followed by a palatal stop the nasal takes that position also and has been written R. In only a few words has m been found. The sonant bilabial stop b is the only one of that series. It is possible that m has become b since if b existed originally one would expect to find also.the aspirated and glottally affected surds. Many of the Athapascan dialects have m but not b.
LIQUIDS.
A tongue tip, trilled r is frequently heard especially from certain speakers. It is very curious but certainly true that other sounds may be substituted in every case for this r with entire correctness. The word for meat, is pronounced bet or ber by the same speakers. In a few other words a final t gives place occasionally to r. Some individuals habitually pronounce r ,when the position is intervocalic where others use d. In the latter case such a transition is not surprising since the d is fully sonant and the trilled r results from several light contacts instead of one firm one (Figs. 16, 53).
Both Petitot and Le Goff write Greek p for a sound described as uvular r, "r graseevant." They employ this to represent a fully sonant palatal sound which is ordinarily completely stopped (g), but in some cases a continuant (G). In the latter circumstance, however, it lacks any decided flapping of the uvula and certainly does not impress the ear as does German or Parisian uvular r.

A lateral liquid, 1, is prominent in all positions in the syllable (Figs. 12, 22, 66, 76, 98, 115, 128). It happens that no formative element beginning with it stands at the beginning of words. It shows morphological connec-
tion with the surd spirant L.

SPIRANTS.
There are three interdental spirants: a sonant written #, a surd written 0, and a glottally affected surd written 0' (Figs. 4, 6, 7, 8, 41, 45, 80, 89, 105). The first two closely resemble English soft and hard th. The tip of the tongue is placed against the edge of the upper incisors and the air allowed
to flow on each side of this contact. These sounds occur where the Pacific and southern languages have z, s, dz, ts, and ts'. It is possible that affrica-
tives are sometimes uttered which should have been written tO, dtQ, and to'
(Figs. 4, 43, 123, 207) but in only one or two cases was an initial stop strong enough to attract attention although it was looked on as a logical probability.
A series of spirants and affricatives is formed between the front of the tongue and the palate not far back of the teeth. These are very similar to
English z and s, but were written even in the same words as j (zh) and c (sh). (Figs. 5, 8, 10, 38, 48, 74, 93). In the texts they have been printed as originally recorded. It was hoped some reason might appear for this variation although it was recognized that they always correspond to dj, j, c, tc, and tc' as they occur in other Athapascan dialects recorded. It may be that the sounds are really intermediate between z and zh as they exist in English and therefore heard alternately.
Closely connected with the liquid 1 is the spirant L which is formed at the same place, between the side of the tongue and the molar teeth. It seems to begin with one approximation of the tongue to the teeth followed by a decided vibration of the surface but no bodily movement of the side of the tongue. The sound impresses the ear as decidedly spirant closely akin in that respect to s (Figs. 32, 33, 93, 130). A glottally affected surd 1 written L' occurs which in some cases at least might be regarded as an affricative, that is as t followed by surd 1 followed by glottal closure (Figs. 5, 34, 38, 83).
A palatal spirant, x, in which more or less bodily vibration of the uvula
takes place occurs (Figs. 51, 52, 56, 174, 178). The vibration of the uvula is plainly evident in the irregular waves shown in several of the figures referred to above. Often, however, this sound was hard to distinguish by ear from h, presumably a glottal spirant, and much confusion occurred in recording it, which has mostly been reproduced in the printed texts. A

76 Anthropological Papers American Museum of Natural History. [Vol. X..
sonant spirant in this position has been written G, but it.seems not to be a definitely independent sound (Figs. 79, 99, 102, 127, 152, 153, 220), and appears to be the result of incomplete contact of the fully sonant palatal stop. In certain words the continuant was always heard while in many words it was only occasionally recorded. In one or two cases an affricative, gG, seemed to be present.
That h, the glottal spirant, occurs independently of x, the palatal spirant, seems certain (Figs. 135, 191, 200). When intervocalic as in other Athapascan languages and English, the tracings often show a sonant which the ear does not differentiate from the surd (Figs. 201, 207). When the glottal spirant occurs after vowels it is written ' since the use of h mightbe mistaken as modifying the quality of the vowel (Fig. 219).
STOPS.
Only the sonant bilabial stop is found in Chipewyan. The tracings obtained show it to be fully sonant, that is, sonant during the closure as is the case in English (Figs. 9, 53, 78, 151). It is surprising, however, that Petitot recorded it sometimes as p. This probably was due not to a lack of sonancy but to some other peculiarity.
The dental series has a fully sonant stop, d (Figs. 10, 13, 14). WVhen

velopment within the dialect. The surd of this serie8, t, is very strongly aspirated, much more so than
in emphatic English syllables. The average length of the aspiration is .12 seconds, as long as ordinary simple sounds (Figs. 11, 54, 55). The passage

is considerably constricted resulting sometimes in a vibration of the tongue (?) which appears in Fig. 18. The glottally affected dental t' is not different from that described for Hupa and Kato and doubtless is made in the same manner with a glottal closure closely following the release. Compare Figs. 57, 85, 121, 129 with a Hupa tracing, P1. 8, Fig. 6, and Kato P1. 7,
Fig. 7. In the palatal position there is a fully sonant stop, g (Figs. 80, 108, 123,
193). The contact is light and often not complete, resulting in a continuant G or, in the neighborhood of 6 or ui a semi-vowel, w (Fig. 198 compared with Fig. 197). Since both Fathers Le Goff and Petitot write p and describe this sound as an uvular r even where it is evidently stopped, some peculiarity of sound was looked for but nothing particularly suggesting such a sound was heard.
A sound evidently originally different is the intermediate palatal stop g the sonancy of which begins with. the release. (Figs. 19, 22, 235). The surd (k) is strongly aspirated corresponding to t (Figs. 24, 101, 112). The glottally affected surd k' is harsh in sound and quite distinct from the other members of the palatal series. The harshness is undoubtedly due to a vibration of the surface of the back of the tongue, and perhaps of the soft palate also, resulting from the diminished air pressure back of the preceding contact. In Fig. 72 these vibrations are reproduced. With this tracing compare a' Hupa tracing.'
Of the aspirated and glottally affected surds there are labialized varieties written kw (Figs. 20, 69, 248) and k'w (Fig. 117). The w of the former ss probably surd; in both cases the sound is probably a simple one and a single character should have been written since the sounds may have been originally independent of the unlabialized stops. It is possible that the
intermediate is also labialized (Fig. 96). The glottal stop ', strong and regular, is found as an important part of
certain words and word-parts. In other cases it was sometimes noticed and written and at other times overlooked if in reality it was uttered. It is probably present before every vowel not preceded by other consonants (Fig. 27). It tends to disappear after spirants but is prominent when intervocalic (Figs. 39, 156, 183, 198). A stop coming before the glottal stop becomes glottally affected. At the end of words ending in vowels (Figs. 26, 33, 62, 113) it has sometimes been confused with the aspiration ', since the glottal stop is usually released with a similar aspiration. It appears to follow n (Figs. 20, 43) and other consonants in which case the stops are written with ' after them.

AFFRICATIVES.

By affricatives is meant a stop plus a spirant. The union is usually a permanent one, the sounds being originally associated or derived from a simple sound. Theoretically, there are three members of each series: an intermediate stop followed by a sonant continuant; a surd stop followed by surd continuant; and a surd stop followed by a surd continuant with glottal closure. The dental series is fully represented with dz or dj (Figs. 17, 58, 59), ts or tc (Figs. 24, 61, 62, 63) and ts' or tc' (Figs. 65, 66, 67, 68). A complete interdental series might be expected, in fact Father Le Goff writes it. In only a few cases was a stop heard preceding the continuants in this series but the tracings in some instances indicate stops. For to examine Figs. 4, 43; dW results from morphological elements being brought together (Fig. 207), while 0',, "again" (Fig. 6) is written by Father Le Goff tthi (W!'). Of the lateral series dl is frequent (Figs. 37, 40) and there seems to be a stop in Figs. 34, 38, 39, and perhaps in every case where L' iS written. There is, however, no clear example of tL, the sound in all cases appearing to be a spirant not preceded by a definite contact. In one or two cases a palatal stop followed by a sonant continuant was written but there is no illustration of this in the tracings. In no case was kx heard.

to be sure the variations were not individual. The frequency with which a sound occurs with a particular length is of more significance than the average. The vowel e, for example, occurs 45 times with a length of 4 mm. (.08 sec.) which may be considered its normal duration. It seems that nearly all of the sounds are at times given double or triple length but there are too many intermediate lengths to make the matter conclusive. Only in the case of fi is length definitely related to quality since the sound does not exceed 5 mm. and averages 3.5 Mm.
It is of interest to note that dissyllabic words accented on the first syllable have relatively short vowels in the second. For example, dlo ne (Fig. 37) 10: 3, L'I ze (Fig. 38) 12: 4, cl ne (Fig. 50) 8: 5, dji ze (Fig. 94) 10: 5. When in such words the accent is on the last syllable the ratio of lengths is reversed: e na (Fig. 73) 5: 10, na Gai (Fig. 79) 7: 20, d'un ni (Fig. 88) 3: 11. There are also many dissyllabic words with nearly even stress in which the lengths are quite exactly balanced: ya za' (Fig. 113) 6: 6, ts'ii tc6k' (Fig. 110) 4: 4, gin gaL (Fig. 182) 6: 6.
Many of the words of three syllables have the middle vowel considerably the longest, and the accent seems to rest also on this syllable: da dzin ne (Fig. 83) 3.5: 5: 3, bes a ze (Fig. .114) 4.5: 6.5: 4, xai t'a zi (Fig. 124) 5: 10: 4, se de Ge (Fig. 127) 6: 12: 4. In the greater number of these words it is the syllable of greater importance that is the longest. The greater degree of length may not be the result of stress accent but used in itself to make the syllable emphatic.

STRESS.
Something resembling the stress accent of English is heard with considerable regularity in Chipewyan. As has been said in the preceding section it rests on the syllable having the greater importance as to the meaning of the word. The word for mouse is d16'ne (Fig. 37). In many Athapascan languages the word is monosyllabic and is applied to rodents, e. g. Jicarilla, dlSe, prairie dogs.' The second syllable is weak as is clearly seen in the tracing. A few words like e na', Cree (Fig. 73) and dfin nl', moose .(Fig. 88) are always accented on the final syllable. The latter word may be a verb form with the stem -ni "to make a noise Y 2 and have the accent on the stem as is usual in verbs. Many words have two accents as, be Oifn'del gai', his skin white (Fig. 131) in which the accent rests on the syllable meaning
skin and the stem -jai of the adjective, white.

The above statement is quite incomplete for the subject of stress is difficult in any case and requires much more observation and analysis than it was possible to give.

PITCH.
Father Le Goff credits pitch with the power of differentiating certain words and syllables as to meaning.' While he does not indicate variation in pitch by accent marks, he does call attention to such differences in notes. The present e'te'l kkezh (e teL k'e), he shoots, has the voice raised on the final syllable, the stem, while it is lowered in the past where the word is in other respects identical.2
No variation of pitch in the syllable itself as in Chinese was observed. Ordinarily, the voice is slightly lowered on the final syllable as the words were spoken in the machine; the ratio being 13:11 or nearly C to A below. In e na', Cree,- and dfin ni', moose, however, the voice was held level. We have then in these words a combination of stress, length and maintained pitch coinciding to strengthen the final syllable.

ASSIMILATION.
Considerable phonetic adjustment has no doubt taken place which has not been noticed. In many cases it may be difficult to detect changes due to the influence of neighboring sounds. The following examples are quite evident.
A surd spirant makes a following continuant consonant surd.
na ne tet hwiu sa, did you stay? Fig. 206; but, nas Oet, I stayed. Fig. 205.
ne Ga, you make, 16, 2; 3 but, was xa, let me make. ye te Gin, she carried him, 15, 12; but, nil wius xe, I am going to carry
it, 19, 21. wa le, it will be, 33, 12; was Le, I will be, 33, 18.
The first person singular subjective prefix s also causes L, a modal prefix to disappear.

Compare na wa sa, I am going across, with nan ni ya, I went across, and note that the y of the stem -ya has been displaced by -s, the first person subjective prefix. Similar forms occur in all known Athapascan languages showing the assimilation to have taken place in the mother language.

It is not to be assumed that the sounds represented in the various languages by the same characters are identically alike. The differences are of the evasive sort which cannot be expressed with printed characters, not differences in position of articulation, sonancy or aspiration.

1 Hupa, Kato, Jicarilla, and probably Navajo have the intermediate (g) which should
have been distinguished in writing from full sonant g.

MORPHOLOGY.
The structure of the Athapascan languages seems remarkably uniform. Since a rather thorough discussion has been given of the Hupa and Kato, it does not seem necessary to repeat at length the general characteristics of the Chipewyan. The verbs and qualifying adjectives stand off from the other parts of speech since in most instances they are composed of a stem and many prefixes and suffixes by the changing of which inflection is produced varying their meanings in many respects. The nouns and pronouns receive suffixes most of which express position or the direction of motion. These are comparable to case endings, but usually have considerable phonetic distinctness.
There are a number of clear cases of noun incorporation when the object is included between prefixes of the verb which. cannot be used or understood independently of the verb. In other cases the object noun stands first in the verb and only the weak form of the verb indicates that the noun is considered a part of it. An example is a de ne heL ni, he spoke to the man, 11, 14 in which de ne, man, is incorporated. The preceding a is meaningless if separated from the remainder of the verb. In line 11 of the same page de ne hel de 1I, people eat, is probably a single word "peoples-eater" but there is no means of being certain. The syllable L'Ui in na L'U ye te nilk t'a, she lowered him with a rope, 11, 4 seems to be connected with L'iUL, rope; if so it is an example of the instrument being incorporated as a noun.
Nouis.
The nouns of Chipewyan fall into about the same classes that appear in the case of the other Athapascan languages which have been systematically studied. There are many simple nouns, generally monosyllabic, with specific non-descriptive application; similar nouns not used without possessive prefixes; and nouns of descriptive meaning qualified by adjectives and verbal suffixes. These suffixes may be conjugated.
The names of classes of people alone may take plural endings. There are no syntactical case endings, but postpositions often have the force of locatives, etc.

NOUNS WITH SUFFIXES.
There are a few entirely dependent noun-forming suffixes which are not traceable to other parts of speech. The most frequently occurring is -kwl, -ke, used in the formation of divisions of human beings; first when the classification is based on age or sex, and second, when persons are grouped as relatives of some individual of the same degree.

be ne ti ke, parents. 13, 22. Cf. Hupa, nik kil xai, your brothers; Kato, te' yan ki, women;
Jicarilla, bi tcec ke, his children.
An uncertain suffix occurs in dfin ne y6, man, 21, 1 (Fig. 122) distinguished as a male being from dun ne, which means man in the wider sense.
There are two suffixes employed with the names of plants and animals either to indicate the young or the adult of the species, or when different species resemble each other to indicate the larger or smaller species. They are also used of natural and artificial objects to grade them into classes according to size.
-tc6k', -tco, large.
61 dai ye tc6k', large jackfish, 31j 8; cf. 61 dai ye, jackfish.
Li! we tc6k', large trout. 15, 17. Lim tc6, horse (Fig. 112); cf. LIM', dog. Oa tc6k', fisher; t)a, martin. Oe 1i tc6k', badger.

i ya ne tso, large buffalo; Navajo, ma' 1 tso, wolf.
-ya ze, small; perhaps originally was restricted to the meaning, "the
young of."
e Olin ya ze, young caribou, 29, 12; e Olin, caribou. el ya ze, small spruce. 33, 17. Lii we ya ze, small fish, 31, 2; LU we, fish. bes a ze, pocket knife (Fig. 114); cf. bes, knife. des a ze, small stream. (Figs. 10, 111.) 6l da yi was ze, I was a small jackfish, 30, 16, has the diminutive
ending conjugated. Cf. Kato, ca' na" yacts, small creek.
COMPOUND NOUNS.
Many nouns are composed of a noun stem followed by a qualifying adjective which by describing the object differentiates it from a similar one.
'I di! e, vest; cf. T', coat and ne di! e, short. (Fig. 120.) i t'a ba Oas, a tree; i t'a, leaves, baD, round, yas, small.

ya del jai, gray back louse; ya, louse, del jai, white.
na G1 te zfinfl, black fox; na g-i te, fox, del ziun, black. 43, 18.
sas del kai, white bears, 29, 2; sas, bear.
sa Oe be@, full moon.

(Fig. 113.)
Closely related to these are the following in which the second term is not a qualifying adjective, but has verbal force.
na Ga din, blind man; na Ga, eyes, din, none. dza Ga la ze, a proper name; leg trembles. be tsii ne ye ne ca, a proper name 15, 2; be tsiu ne, his grand-
mother, ye ne ca, she raised him.
Many compound nouns have the second member in the possessive case. In other instances it is difficult to be sure whether this relation exists or not.'
e lez OAu, bladder; urine sack. et 0n ke ge, caribou tracks. 16, 11. e tca ho 0'fin ne, rib. 9, 1. sa L'U le, sunbeams; sun strings. 21, 2. sa 6fi#, furs, beaver skins. 44, 18.

ka tui we, goose lake. 43, 7.
Lin tcok' 0l L'U le, bridle; dog- large head rope. da tsa tcel le, a small crow; da tsa, crow, tcel le, younger brother (?).
A few compounds have no indication or possibility of a possessive relation but have the first element qualifying the second.
Oe ceO, Rocky Mountains; this term is probably a translation only of the English name. (Fig. 116.)
tc'ail e dlii ne, a jumping mouse; frog-mouse. L'O bec, mowing machine; grass-knife. yaO li, hail; cf. yaO, snow and l lIi, hail. (Fig. 115.)
One noun, tel k'IO i, gun, 44, 2, is a verb in form with the stem -k'eo, to shoot with a gun. There are probably many other verb forms so used.
1 In other Athapascan languages the second member is usually preceded by a possessive
prefix. Cf. Navajo, ni ij bi zIs, your urine its sack: Jicarilla, ca bI L' le, the sun its strings
(beams).

PRONOUNS.
PERSONAL PRONOUNS.
The personal pronouns are seldom used independently except in direct address or where emphasis or contrast is desired. Both subject and object are incorporated in the verb, but in some instances it is impossible to connect them with the independent forms.
First Person.' se, I, me. Used when emphasis is desired for nominative or accusative case. sa, saE, for me, to me. 16, 4; 17, 7. (Fig. 133.) Evidently a contraction of se with -a, the latter giving the force of a dative. seL, with me. The final element L, perhaps preceded by a vowel, indicates accompaniment and is probably connected with the prefix eI-, which has a reciprocal force. Cf. Hupa, hwe, me; Kato, cl, I, ca, for me, CUL, with me; Jicarilla, ci, I, Navajo, ci, I.

Second Person Singular. nen, niTn, you. 14, 2; 10, 4. neL, with you. 25, 19. na, for you. 36, 5. Cf. Hupa, nini, you; Kato, ninl, you, na, for you, nuL, with you; Jicarilla, n di, you; Navajo, ni, you.

Third person singular. The pronouns of the third person usually betray some demonstrative
force. The limited material employed does not disclose a clear distinction in the meaning or use of the stems listed below.
xa, for him. 38, 18. xeL, heL, XfAL, with him; 17, 9; 7, 7, cf. xeL, with by the instru-
mentality of. 18, 7. xi 11, hi II, with. 13, 14. Cf. Hupa, x6fi, he, him; Kato, huiin, he, him, liL, with him; Jica-
rilla, hi, he.
ba, to him, 8, 3; for her, 14, 14. beL, with them. 24, 19.
keL, with it. 17, 8. Cf. Kato, kin, himself, kwluL, with him.
Reflexive. e di ni, himself. 10, 4; 23, 14. e de xa, for himself. 30, 2. e de ba, around himself. 21, 3.

DEMONSTRATIVE PRONOUNS.
e ye, that. 8, 4. e ye ne, those. 27, 17. e yi, that. 7, 15. yaE, for him. 16, 4. (Fig. 204.) yeL, with him. 24, 9. Cf. Hupa, yo, that; Kato, hai ye, that. di di,' this, these. 9, 7. (Fig. 15.) di ri, this, these. (Fig. 16.) Cf. Hupa, ded, this; Kato, di, this; Jicarilla, di, this; Navajo,
di, di di, this. t'a that, 9, 21; often used to point out one of several persons or
things characterized by a descriptive phrase or clause.

POSSESSIVE PRONOUNS.
The possessive forms are in some cases simpler than the independent forms which it seems probable have been extended by formative elements. They are prefixed to the nouns they limit. A list and examples will be found on page 96.
1 This seems to be an example of reduplication, since di, or de is a demonstrative by
itself.

114 Anthropological Paper.s American Museum of Natural History. [Vol. X,
RELATIVE PRONOUNS.
There seem to be no relative pronouns, although relative clauses are not infrequent. A verbal suffix, -ni, seems to be used to subordinate one clause to another. An example will be found on page 7, line 9; nil ni ye ga ni ni ya ni, "wolves to them which came." In some instances the demonstrative, t'a, has the double meaning of "that which."
ADJECTIVE PRONOUNS.
Only a few adjective pronouns have been observed. h6 del yW, all. 28, 9. ho na sI, remainder. 28, 11. t'a Oe ri, the oldest. 34, 2. t'a ge "a ze, the farthest one. 17, 6. b6 neL t'Vi, both. 9, 21. L&i , Las, many. 16, 20; 17, 1. t'a ne zui, the best. 20, 10. t'a hi ufn ni, the next. 21, 18.

VERBS.
The verbs of Chipewyan, like those of other Athapascan languages, are built up of many elements, each having a fixed place in the verb. Some of -these have meanings which are clearly apparent when verb forms containing them are compared with other forms which lack them or have different elements. Only a few of these elements occur in the language except in the verb forms. Since the stem, that is, the element which most clearly defines the act, stands toward the end of the verbal complex, it is convenient to subdivide these elements into prefixes, stems, and suffixes.
The prefixes standing first in order are adverbial ones which indicate the position or direction of the action. For example, ye da ni ya, he went in, has for the first element, ye, which means in. In many verbs, these adverbial prefixes are not required and do not occur. Next in order are modal prefixes the meanings of which are more difficult to determine. Some of them, at least, limit the time of the act, particularly in regard to its inception, continuance, or completion. If a man starts out on foot, te ya, is the verb used; but if he arrives, nI ni ya. In these words te is used for acts which are beginning and ni for acts which are completed.
Following the modal prefixes are the subjective prefixes of the first and second person. The third person is usually without such a prefix, but sometimes a deictic prefix connected with a demonstrative stem is used in the third person, but its position is near the beginning of the verbal complex. Let me stab is, hwiis gwi; you stab, hini gwi; let him stab, yiu gwi in which the sign of the first person is s, the second person is n, and the third person, y.
Some verbs have modal prefixes following the subjective prefix and immediately preceding the stem. One of these is capable of changing an intransitive verb to a transitive one, oi of involving a person other than the subject in the act, while another shows that the act is repeated.
The stems, which in many cases conclude the verbs, beside defining the act often indicate by their forms the class of objects effected. For many verbs an entirely different stem is used when the object is plural, and in a -few verbs there are different stems for the singular, dual, and plural. The stems often change their form slightly for the past tepse.
Suffixes are more rarely found than are prefixes. They are frequently dissyllabic and some of them appear to be reduced verb forms. They are ,employed to indicate the source of information and limit the verb modally.
With so many elements entering into the verb there is a mathematical possibility of an enormous number of verb forms. Usage has, however, selected certain combinations which have become adjusted phonetically

and these are employed with little consciousness of the meaning of the individual elements.
It is not always easy to be sure whether certain elements are to be con-
sidered as a part of the verb or whether they belong to a preceding noun or pronoun. They have been written as a part of the verb in many cases because they are phonetically adjusted to it. In the verb bini kas kiA lo sac, ",I would roll for it," 33, 3, the separation of the phrase biii ka, "for it," would leave the phonetically incomplete s kuiO lo sa'. Phrases such as, be gin, from him, written with the verb, page 28, line 17, be gOfn na setdil ni ta, they had gone away from him, have not .been discussed in the following pages, but have been treated on page 122 above.

Cf. Hupa, xan te, look for it; Kato, ka yac ufn te, they looked for it; Jicarilla, xa na n dai, go for it.

OBJECT PREFIXES.
Pronouns in their reduced forms are prefixed to the verb when an object is required. They have their place at the beginning of the verb or after the adverbial prefixes in case they are present. The forms of the pronouns are: first person singular, se, ce, s-; second person singular, ne-,
1 In Hupa and Kato this prefix is also used with the meaning of ti-, above.

132 Anthropological Papers American Museum of Natural History. [Vol. X,
n-; first and second person plural, n6, no xe; third person singular and plural, be-, ye-.
ce ginL teL, take me. 15, 11. na S1 L'iin, 'dress me, 16, 5; but, nai ye L'5n, she dressed him, 16, 5. se ne yuL hi sa, they are following me. 19, 8. ne kel nil ni si, who kept you. 37, 14. "a ne tils ne hi le si, I will not leave you, 40, 15; but, a se te diik,
he threw me away, 31, 5. nel ginL xel wa le sI, it gets dark with you. 12, 11. na nil hwe l ginL UL, take us. 7, 2. e kwa a nil xeL nI hi lee, did not tell us that way. 7, 13. e deL tsI hwiu, when he made himself. 23, 20.
It is evident that in Chipewyan the noun object may be incorporated.
a de ne heL ni, he spoke to the man. 11, 14. be na ho de ne Ge tcfO, she wrapped the man. 11, 4.
In the two examples given above, the noun de ne, man, occupies the place of the object pronoun. In other cases because there are no prefixes preceding the noun it is not possible to tell whether the noun is to be taken with the verb or not.
FIRST MODAL PREFIXES.
There are a number of modal prefixes having position next after the adverbial prefixes which are weak or reduced in form. The meaning of these elements is obscure.
ne-, nil-,
nil wius xe, I am going to carry. 19, 21. nil was ,% I will look. 29, 4. ne ginL de hwiu, she washed. 8, 6. ni ye niL ti, she put him down. 15,-13. niis da, I will sit. 8, 10. da ne wiln leL, lean them. 12, 10. ne tes, they two lay. 8, 11. Cf. Hupa, xa nil win te, she looked for it; Kato, tc'n n6L y
let it blow.
de-, di-, in some words the meaning of separation is suggested. de teL nll, he reached. 7, 15. na xa de ge la, were pulled back. 15, 8.
di Gin Eat', she unfastened. 16, 19. Cf. Hupa, tcit dii wim mitc, he pulled off; Kato, na dic tca, let
me eat.

1912.1

Goddard, Analysis of Cold Lake Dialect.

133

te-, is used of acts thought of as beginning. te wiu t'as, we two will go. 16, 20. te ya, he went. 26, 10. te 6- del, we went. 43, 17. Cf. Hupa, na tes deL, they started back; Kato, tc' tes yai, he went.
It is uncertain whether he-, in such verbs as, he Ge ln, she became, 10, 17, is a first modal prefix or a deictic prefix with reference to the subject.

DEICTIC PREFIXES.
Many verbs contain a demonstrative element which usually stands after the adverbial and first modal prefixes but before the second modal prefixes. This refers to the object in many cases but may refer to the subject.
y-, ye-, usually confined to the third person of the verb and apparently used when the object is known and has been mentioned.
ye hfinL ¶, he found (a place). 37, 3. ye E, he saw it. (Fig. 199.) ye ne caE, she raised him. 14, 9. (Fig. 217.) ni ye niL ke, she tracked him. 16, 9. Cf. Kato, yi gfin yani, they ate it; Jicarilla, yi yes xi, he killed it.
b-, used as the last except that it more frequently occurs in the first and second persons.'
be hwiis aL, I am going to find it.
ts'-, used of the object, and perhaps the subject, when less definitely known and referred to.
ts'el del, they ate them. 7, 4. ts'e LU, he was caught. 21, 3. "a ts'e di, he addressed. 22, 13. Cf. Hupa, kin nifi en, he brought it; Kato, tc'o' sfit, pound.
he-, is used for the dual or plural of verbs in the third person.
ye he Ej, they two saw him; but, ye j,, he saw him.
na he ye ginL tc'il, they (dual or plural) tore it; but, na ye ginLtc'il, he tore it.
he he dui, they said, 8, 9; but, he nil, he said, 33, 13.
da-, is used for the plural of verbs in the third person. da ye he Ej they (plu.) saw him. da nel djet', they are afraid.
1 The material for illustrating this difference in use is scanty but by taking into con-
sideration the phrases which precede the verbs it can be demonstrated. On page 36, line 3,
be ka el ya de, if you go for, and line 5, be ka wa sai, I will go for them, but in the same line,
ye ka he ya, he started for them

134 Anthropological Papers American Museum of Natural History. [Vol.- X;
SECOND MODAL PREFIXES.
The second modals seem to relate to the beginning, continuance, or cessation of the act or state. It is not certain that they are unrelated to the first modals which they resemble in form; their position however is different and they are generally confined to the past tenses, in their use.
g-, gin-, is used of acts or states which continue and are viewed as continuing for some time.
na gin #et', he stayed there. 13, 11. gin leL, you carry. 10, 3. ginL as, they came (approached), 19, 14; but, ye gdn nI niL as,
they came (arrived) to her, 19, 15. .ne ginL de hwii, she washed. 8, 6. Cf. Hupa, na wifn yen, he stood; Kato, gun eL, you carry.
It is to be presumed that the w- which appears in many futures and presents of the first person is connected with this prefix.
ni will Ej, let us look (Fig. 203). xa wa sa, let me go up (Fig. 173).
tv-, 0-, te-, Oe., is also used of acts and states which are in progress. na Mti ya, I went. 17, 1. Oe dai, he sat, 14, 9; but, ne da,' she seated herself, 19, 14. Oe la hi k'e, (hair) was lying. 10, 12. Cf. Hupa, me tsis yen, who stands in; Kato, ka si del,, we came up.
n-, nin-, is used of acts viewed as completed. ni ni ya, he came. 8, 2. nin dja, he came 'back). 10, 1. ni gi, he put him down, 21, 10; but, ne te gi, he took on his back, 21, 9. Cf. Hupa, me niL xe, he finished it; Kato, ni gi ne, I bring.
d-, is probably also a second modal, although the few cases in which it occurs might be explained as examples of the first modal de-.
dinLas, they came, 19, 16; but, ginLas, they came, 19, 14; no difference in meaning being apparent.
deL da, she sat. 18, 14. ni Ga de ya, she waded in. 19, 2. na de la nI t'a, they were around. 23, 3. xa da del la, he took out. 18, 2.
h-, he-, seems to be used with no reference to beginning, completion or
continuance.

THIRD MODAL PREFIXES.1
The modal prefixes which are found between the subjective prefixes and the stems in some instances may by their presence or absence change the meaning of the verb. Certain stems are not used without the third modal L-, while t or d is usually found with the iterative.
L-, has a transitive force in some cases, or is used when an indirect object of a verb of speaking or saying is in mind.
heL ni t'a, he called, addressed him, 13, 18; but, he ni, he said, 13, 16.
ni n1Leas, the wolves came, 8, 16; but, ni ni 'as, they two (men) came, 7, 6.
ni niL tvi, he brought it (a person), 13, 5; but, ni ni ta, he brought it (a long object), 9, 2.
1-, with a few stems is found in all the forms, and at times with stems which are also used without any modal prefix or with L-.
nel djet', he is afraid (Fig. 222.) na tsel kos, he jumped. 13, 1. huil yI , called. 45, 14. nil ge, (dog) came, 45, 9. gel tI, they put him. 38, 17. nil ,as hi lee, they do not come. 32, 3.
n-, an n is found in the past tenses of many verbs preceding the stem or the third modal L-, but no meaning is known for it.
di Gin eat', she unfastened. 16, 19. ni ginL Lal hi k'e, he could not move. 8, 12. ye yint CT' hwu, when they dug. 9, 2. yi h6nL ea, she found him. 14, 9.
The relation of these third modals is brought out by the following examples:
na ye ginL tc'il, he tore it; na gail tc'il, it is torn (someone did it);

X These prefixes in Hupa ate discussed under the caption Classes, p. 34, and for Kato in
the section headed Third Modals, pp. 57-9.

140 Anthropological Papers American Museum of Natural History. [Vol. X,
na gin tc'll, it tore (from ordinary wear). da ye gin ,ftt, he tore it; da get 'fit', it is untied by someone; da get dflk', it came untied by
itself.
o-, u-, is used in the future only. Since this prefix is used in the same forms with the third modal prefixes and precedes them, it probably is not connected with them in meaning or function.
tius be, let me swim (Fig. 168). tiu sa, let him walk (Fig. 187). te wu diL, let us walk (Fig. 190). Cf. Hupa, y6 loi, let him tie (only found in third person); Kato,
tc'6 gac, let him chew it (third person only); Jicatilla, d6 ya, let him come; Navajo, a d6 niL, he will do it.
VERBAL STEMS.
The meaning of the verbal stem can sometimes be discovered by accounting for the meaning of all other elements entering into the verb, when it appears that the stem must have the meaning which is required to give the complete verb the sense required to fit the context. For example in line 13 of page nine an teL az de, is said to mean "if it runs away," and the context requires such a meaning. It has been discovered however, that an means "away," that te means "to begin," that L is used with certain stems and when its meaning is discoverable it has a transitive force, and finally the last syllable gives the conditional force, "if." The stem az carries then the meaning of movement. By examination of the various words which have stems meaning to move it is found that az is only used of animals moving on four feet, and used only with a plural subject.
It is also possible to place side by side a number of verbs which are alike
except that the stems (lifer. Since there is but one variable it is easy to
see what the meaning must be to produce the differences in meaning.
nI ni ya, he came, one on foot. ni ni "as, they came, two on foot. ni ni del, they came, more than two on foot. ni ni ki, he came, one or more in a canoe. ni nI ta, he brought something long. ni nIL az, they came, wolves or other four-footed animals.
It has not been possible of course to determine the meaning of all the stems in this manner. The meaning placed after the isolated stem is simply a judgment of what it probably means, and the examples are to illustrate this judgment and are not to be considered proofs of its meaning.

VERBAL SUFFIXES.
As will appear from the comparative material presented, the greater number of the prefixes and stems are found in languages other than the Chipewyan. The suffixes with one or two exceptions, however, are not found on the Pacific Coast or in the Southwest. It seems probable that they are recent developments in Chipewyan.
- le,, -hi le,, renders the preceding statement negative. a wo le hi lee, you will not do to him. 11, 20.
wils na hi le, sl% I will not live it is. 36, 18.
ne tca hi lee t'a, because he was not large. 33, 10. nI dja hI le t'ii, he had not come. 21, 5.
-wa B., -wa le, used in future or conditional statements in which some
doubt exists.' na ges dae wa iI sI, I will live. 37, 21. na gin dal wa II, you will live. 36, 2. ho neL na wa le sI, he beats. 33, 12.
-ni, seems to be used as a relative, making a clause of a verb.2 La gal deE ni, which he had killed. 10, 21. te del ni, who came. 26, 1. na Oe ya nI, when he went again. 27, 15. ge GaL nl, as he walked. 8, 1.

-hi t'a, similar to the last in force but apparently used of present facts. aL en hi t'a, she carried. 10, 9. Oin da hi t'a, (why) do you sit here? 37, 11.
-lo saE, indicates the probability of a future event. na ne neL ti 16 saE, I may carry you back. 23, 11.
e ke hoi yi lo sae, something might stick. 33, 2.
Le ga de nI tet' lo sd% suppose you might kill yourself. 33, 4.

TENSES OF VERBS.
Many of the suffixes, either directly or indirectly, fix the time of the verb. The future tense in addition to a peculiar form of the root used in the present and future has a prefix 6- discussed above. The past tense is differentiated from the present and future in other ways not clearly traceable-

to the presence of definite word parts. The stem of the past sometimes has a glottal stop at the end where the present lacks it or has an aspiration.
ne EjEx he stole it; ne T'., he is about to steal it.
The past has a sonant 1 where the present has a surd L.
ginL xul, he struck; Al dinL xaL, you throw a stick in the fire.
The vowel of the stem is sometimes different.
a yin la, he made; ai yii le, let him make. as La, I made; a was Le, let me make.
The stem sometimes has a stop or a nasal consonant or nasal vowel which does not appear in the present and the vowel may be different in addition.
01 g6t, I speared it; wius ge, let me spear it. nuil 01 bi, I swam there (Fig. 167); tius be, let me swim (Fig. 168).
The first person singular of the past lacks the prefix s- as has been explained above; the past also often has the second modals which are not usually employed with the present. Complete conjugation svstems would require many pages and would not present material other than that discussed in the preceding pages. They will be found in Father Le Goff's grammar. One example in the present and past follows:

na was tC'UL, let me tear it. na neL tC'UL, tear it. nai yuL tC'UL, let him tear it.

Present.
na will tC'UL, let us tear it. noL tc'uL, you (plu.) tear it. na he yfL tC'UL, let them tear it.

Past.

na GiL tc'l1, I tore it.

na Gil tc'Il, we tore it.

na GinL tc'il hwui sa, did you tear it? na w5L te'il hwul sa, did vou (plu.)

tear it?

na ye GinL tc'il, he tore it.

na he ye GinL tc'il, they tore it.

ADJECTIVES.
The qualifying adjectives of Chipewyan as of other Athapascan languages are conjugated for person and number. The prefixes appear to be the second modal prefixes of verbs and apparently relate to the acquisition, or the permanency of the possession of the quality named in the stem.
