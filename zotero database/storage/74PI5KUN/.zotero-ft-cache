Preface
It is commonly thought that poetic language is beyond ordinary language—that it is something essentially different, special, higher, with extraordinary tools and techniques like metaphor and metonymy, instruments beyond the reach of someone who just talks. But great poets, as master craftsmen, use basically the same tools we use; what makes them different is their talent for using these tools, and their skill in using them, which they acquire from sustained attention,
study, and practice.
Metaphor is a tool so ordinary that we use it unconsciously and automatically, with so Utde effort that we hardly notice it. It is omnipresent: metaphor suffuses our thoughts, no matter what we are thinking about. It is accessible to everyone: as chudren, we automatically, as a matter of course, acquire a mastery of everyday metaphor. It is conventional: metaphor is an integral part of our ordinary everyday thought and language. And it is irreplaceable: metaphor allows us to understand our selves and our world in ways that no other modes of thought can.
Far from being merely a matter of words, metaphor is a matter of thought—all kinds of thought: thought about emotion, about society, about human character, about language, and about the nature of life and death. It is indispensable not only to our imagination but also to our reason.
Great poets can speak to us because they use the modes of thought we all possess. Using the capacities we all share, poets can illuminate our experience, explore the consequences of our beliefs, challenge the ways we think, and criticize our ideologies. To understand the nature and value

as well: when one is alive, one is functioning; when one is dead, one is not functioning. This is a nonmetaphorical aspect of our understanding of death. As such, it can be used
as s?^fce domain for other metaphors. For example, if
we say "The phone is dead," we are using the general MA-
CHINES ARE PEOPLE metaphor, which maps human death onto the failure of the machine to operate. It is the nonmet-
aphorical understanding of death that is mapped in this metaphor—not the metaphorical understanding of death in
terms of departure, cold, darkness, and so on. The meta-
phorical understanding of death is used to comprehend
other aspects of death than mere nonfunctionality.

metaphor. We perceive light, react to it emotionaUy, and know that it allows us to see things. But light as a scientific
phenomenon requires a further understanding. We have
two common scientific metaphors for light: as waves and as
particles that move faster than anything else in the universe. But this metaphorical understanding of light is not used in
the metaphor by which we understand life as light. The aspoppefhhclooigtrrshdhtoeaefpvittheehenendrcosaothsninicpnseagtpertttaiocodlfedlosoignohwrctiatewhsrettawhuiaensvemneoisnen.ttTamhpheeehtuoalfirpfeiech--aaoaslrs^ic-clloiiaggnlhhckttenmmpoeetwittoaal-n--

consciously, a correspondence between a traveler and a person living the life, the road traveled and the "course" of a lifetime, a starting point and the time of birth, and so on.
One of the reasons that this form of understanding is

I have to go into the forest
where the Tamala trees

to distinguish journeys from other kinds of activities, but

shade the river-bank
and maybe the thick reeds I

not so rich as to mle out any particular kind of journey. As a consequence, the understanding of life as a journey permits not just a single simpleminded concepmalization of life

but rather a rich and varied one. Because our knowledge of

journeys includes options for types of journeys, the metaphorical understanding of life in terms of a journey includes options for a corresponding variety of understandings of

life. To the extent that one views life as purposeful, those

purposes are viewed as destinations, and we can act accordingly by setting out to reach them, getting around

impediments, and accepting guidance. Correspondingly,
to the extent that we see life as not involving purposes, we can view our journey as wandering and observing the landscape.
Two things permit such richness: the stmcture of our knowledge of journeys and our ability to map from that

structured knowledge to a conception of life. The struc-

ture of our knowledge of journeys can be seen as having

well-difFerentiated components such as travelers, a start-

ing point, a path, impediments, and so on; some are re-

quired and some, like destinations, vehicles, companions, and guides, are optional. We wiu call knowledge structured
in such a skeletal form a "schema," and we will use the term

"slots'" for elements of a schema that are to be filled in.

Thus, a JOURNEY schema has a slot for TRAVELER that can

be filled by any particular person whom we understand to be on a journey. Indeed, the very concept of a traveler can be

defined only relative to the concept of a journey. Under-

'In another passage, Amichai personifies "the coming day": I'll wake up early and bribe the coming day to be kind to us. (Selected Poetry, p.4) External events affect us in ways we cannot control, and via EVENTS ARE ACTIONS WC can understand those events as acdons by a world we cannot control. Through the metonymy of the time period ("the coming day") standing for the state of the world during that period, the coming day is seen as the actor who performs those events. In the logic of this metaphor, maybe one can deal with that actor the way one deals with others who are in control, namely by bribAinCgThIOimN.SThmeewtaoprhdo"rbarinbde"thinevaockceosmbpoatnhytihneg EpeVrEsoNnTifSicaAtRioEn metaphor, since the individual bribed is normally required to be human. Not all metaphors that map from persons in the source domain are personifications. In some metaphors, a person in one schema is understood in terms of a person in another. For example, LIFE is A JOURNEY maps a traveler who is a person in the source domain onto a person in the target domain. In other metaphors, we understand a person m terms of something that is not a person; for example, PEOPLE ARE PLANTS maps a plant in the source domain onto a person in the target domain. But understanding death as a footman is a personification because though death is not inherently a person, it is being understood as a person through the metaphor ofdeath-as-departure, in which the fooünan escorts you. Conceiving of death as a footman is simple immediate, and natural, like the great variety of personifications that we saw in chapter one: death as a reaper, time as a devourer, and so on. What makes these munediate and natural is that they arise as a consequence of composition from other more baIsniccchoanpcteeprtounalerewseouorbcseesr.ved, in loose terms, that death

The reaper enters in the special scenario of planting, cultivation, and harvesting. Similarly, the personification of time as a thief does not come solely from the general metaphor that life is
a precious possession, since the most general case of that
metaphor has no thieves, but only the loss of life. Again, the
thief enters only in the special scenario.

that agent. Sometimes this further knowledge came from a
basic metaphor like PEOPLE ARE PLANTS, sometimes from the cultural model that THE PASSAGE OF TIME PLAYS A
CAUSAL ROLE IN EVENTS OF CHANGE, and sometimes from
both, as when this cultural model combines with the meta-
phor LIFE IS A PRECIOUS POSSESSION to give us the means
to understand time as a thief.
To say that such instances of personification arise through
composition is to say something remarkable: We can produce an indefinitely large number of instances of personification from metaphors that do not themselves contain any personifications. All we need to do is to put those metaphors and bits ofnonmetaphorical hiowledge together in the right way.

can be seen as being a death at the hand of an agent. Or the natural loss of youthful powers can be seen as caused by some agency, as in "dme, the subtle thief of youth."
^ Second, because actions are events, the mappmg from ac-
tions to events has a structure somewhat different from other mappings. Each action consists of an event plus the

result of an action and introducing the agent who brings
that action about.
To see how this works in detail, let us consider how we
arrive at an understanding of death as a reaper. First, the EVENTS ARE ACTIONS metaphor stmctures the event of death as the result of an action and adds to the event of
death an agent who brings that event about. Second, the
PEOPLE ARE PLANTS metaphor can be elaborated via a scenario of cultivation of plants, in which the plants at the end of their life cycle are harvested. The source domain ofharvesting may contain a reaper, which, as we saw above, is not
inherendy part of the mapping from plants onto people. Third, the action of harvesting is identified as the relevant
acdon in the EVENTS ARE ACTIONS metaphor, and the agent of death is identified as the reaper, who is the agent ofhar-
vesting in the harvest scenario. It is by this mechanism that the reaper, who is not conventionally mapped by the PEO-
PLE AM; PLANTS metaphor, gets to be mapped as a result of the composition of PEOPLE ARE PLANTS with EVENTS ARE
ACTIONS.

We have used the term "basic metaphor" to refer to any
conceptual metaphor whose use is conventional, uncon-
scious, automatic, and typicaUy unnoticed. So far we have
talked about basic metaphors as if they were all of one type. But, as we just saw in our discussion of personification, the

Some of the parameters of generic-level structure are these: — Basic ontological categories: entity, state, event, action,
situation, and so on.
_Aspects of beings: attributes, behavior and so on. — Event shape: instantaneous or extended; single or re-

out fixed stages that end where they begin. — Causal relations: enabling, resulting in, bringing about,

COHERENCE AMONG METAPHORS

Coherence among Metaphors
The passages cited in chapter one contain a large number of j personifications of time: Time the reaper, time the devourer. Time the destroyer, Time the runner, and so on. As we saw these apparendy disparate metaphors are structur. ally similar: all of them involve a change over time. We
showed earlier in this chapter that this commonality could be characterized adequately by analyzing all of the personi-
fications as special cases of TIME is A CHANGER, where the differences arise from additional information in the form of
other basic metaphors and commonplace knowledge. Moreover, we saw that TIME is A CHANGER arises-by composition of EVENTS ARE ACTIONS with our commonplace knowledge that things change over time. By virtue of such analyses we can see more precisely how metaphors are re-
lated to one another.
relBateiocnasuhsiepsmaemtaopnhgomrsectaapnhboersfocarmn ebde beyxtcreommeploysciotimonp,lethxe. Let us now consider some relationships among metaphors
where there is no single basic metaphor that is common to
them all. Let us ask what relationships there are among the
metaphors A LIFETIME is A DAY, A LIFETIME is A YEAR,

In such cases, the stmcture of the target domain constrains
the choice of source domain-structure. Another kind of coherence among metaphors can be seen
in LIFE IS A FLAME, which is a composite of LIFE is LIGHT
and LIFE is HEAT. The LIFE is LIGHT metaphor views death as darkness, and the LIFE is HEAT metaphor views death as cold. Each of these has a strong experiential grounding.
People who are alive are warm, and people who are dead
are cold. People who are alive are typically active during
daylight and inactive during darkness. Plants derive Ufe
from sunlight and die in sustained darkness. Also, there is
a common" correlation between light and heat, because in
our daily experience, light sources almost always emit heat
as well.

LIFE IS A FLAME, LIFE IS A FIRE, LIFE IS A PRECIOUS POS-

These two metaphors are extremely basic and extremely

!;

SESSION, LIFE IS PRESENCE HERE, and LIFE IS A FLUID.
These are all related to one another through a common-
place theory that the source domain of life is structured in
a particular way. This commonplace theory can be factored
into two parts, a very general part and an elaboration of it.
Let us consider the general part first, that life is a cycle,
which ends where it began. It has a stmcture of three stages: first we're not alive; second, we are alive; and third, we are dead. Because the target domain of LIFE is structured
in this way, it is natural to conceive of it in terms ofmeta-
phors whose source domains can have the same three-part
stmcture. First, LIFE is PRESENCE HERE: before birth^we are absent; during life we are present; and after death we
are absent again. Second, LIFE is A PRECIOUS POSSESSION:
first we don't have it; then we have it; then we lose it. Third,

general. Though each is fairly simple in itself, they form composites with an elaborated version of the commonplace theory of life as a cycle: at birth, we are relatively powerless; we grow to our greatest power at maturity, then decline to pporowveidrleesssanecsosncaegpatinoaf taelxifterecmyceleoltdhaagt en.oSt cohnelymeantidcsallwy,htehries iptobweegri.nLsIFbEutisalLsIoGhHaTsasntdagLeIFsEofiswHaExAinTgmanetdapthheonricwaaUnyinfigll
out this elaborated cognitive model of the life cycle by using existing knowledge about the patterns of light and heat to characterize the nature of that power, metaphoricauy. The result is the composite metaphor, LIFE is A CYCLE OF THE
WAXING AND WANING OF LIGHT AND HEAT.
This extremely general composite metaphor gets filled out with specific instances in which the source domain in-

LIFE is HEAT. Given the stmcture of their source domains, a year, a day, and a fire map naturally onto the stmcture of •

The case is rather diflFerent with LIFE is A FLUID, which shows up in expressions like "she's bursting with life," "he s brimming with vim and vigor," and "the life seems to have drained out of him."

We know that rainbows are beautiful, special, inspiring, larger than life, almost mystic, and that seeing them makes us happy and awestruck. This knowledge is mapped onto what we know of the horse: it too is awe-inspiring, beaudful, larger than life, aknost mysdc. This line comes from a poem containing a series of such

We might for example see the general physical outline of hair with tendrils as corresponding to flickering peaks and wisps of flame. Or we might see the dancing play of sunlight glistening off the hair as corresponding to the skittering of flame through the brush and, furthermore, the actual strands of hair as corresponding to plant shoots ablaze in the brush. We might map the color of a fire onto the wife's hair, making her a redhead. Such possible mappings of image-stmcture onto image-stmcture might lead us to explore possible knowledge mappings. For example, bmsh fires are notoriously difficult to control and therefore dangerous. They break out without warning and flare up quickly. How might we map this knowledge onto the wife's hair?

to be "out of order" or "out of cominission" or to have
"conked out." Thus, it is not just candles that are "out," but
also generators telephone service, and so on. Thus, "Out, out'brief candle" is metaphorically coherent in two ways: ^ito?y,do,the.L,IPE Is LIGHT andLIFE Is HEAT metaphors

Because image-schemas can be used to structure both physical scenes and abstract domains, Auden can use one
image-schema to connect the image of a leaking teacup with
the domain of life and death:

The desert sighs in the bed,
And the crack in the tea-cup opens
A lane to the land of the dead.^

Here, the rocking cradle stands for the baby it contains, namely Christ. Such a metonymy is referential in nature; by referring to the cradle, the poet can refer to Christ.
But why use a metonymy at all? Why not just say "Christ"? One reason is that the passage occurs in a poem about historical cycles, focusing on the Second Coming. The poem contains many images of cycles, from "Turning

On the second reading, there is a complex interaction of
nietaphor and metonymy. First, the crow symbolizes death.

It does so in two ways. By metonymy alone, the crow (a

scavenger that feeds on dead animals) evokes, and stands

for, death. And by the DEATH is DARKNESS metaphor, to-

None of this is true in metonymy.

onymic mapping occurs within a single domam, not
across domains.
— Metonymy is used primarily for reference: via metonymy, one can refer to one entity in a schema by referring to
another entity in the same schema.
— In metonymy, one entity in a schema is taken as standing for one other entity in the same schema, or for the

tonymy whereby WORDS STAND FOR THE CONCEPTS THEY EXPRESS. It is as general and automatic a metonymy as there is, since in the use of language, words do stand for the concepts they express. However, this fact about the use of language is distinct from the metonymy itself. The me-
tonymy can be seen in expressions such as "That is a selfcontradictory utterance." Strictly speaking, what one utters are sequences of sounds. Sequences of~sounds, in themselves, do not have logical properties and so cannot be
self-contradictory. But, by metonymy, we understand "utterance" in "That is a self-contradictory utterance" as referring to the concepmal content expressed by the utterance, and it is that conceptual content that is being claimed to be self-contradictory. Similarly, in a sentence Uke "Those are
foolish words," the words are taken as referring, via me-
tonymy, to the concept expressed by the words^which are
being called foolish.

using this metonymy, which is after au part of the structure of our language, and using the term "metaphor" to denote the words that express a concepmal metaphor.

and no distinction is made between the words in themselves

ALL READING IS READING IN
A related confusion arises in literary smdies. It is the idea
the meaning of a poem or other literary work resides
in the words themselves. Words are sound sequences that conventionally express concepts that are within conceptual Schemas. Consequently, words typically evoke conceptual Schemas beyond the part of the schema that the word des-
Thus, "reaper" evokes the entire schema for plant
c^luvation. That is, words evoke in the mind much more than they strictly designate. What is meaningful are not the words, the mere sound sequences spoken or letter se-
on a page, but the conceptual content that the words evoke. Meanings are thus in people's minds, not in
the words on the page.
In the case of metaphor, this distinction is all the more
important because people have, as part of their normal conceptual systems, a wealth of conceptual metaphors that they
use to make sense of their experience. These metaphors, like
other conceptual content, reside in people's minds, not on any pages or in any sounds. Many meanings are conven-
tional and shared, and these limit what a literary work can mean to someone. Literary works, for this reason, cant
mean just anything. But, because what is meaningful is in the mind, not in the words, there is an enormous range of
possibilities open for reasonable interpretation of a liter-
ary work.
When a reader gives a highly unusual or idiosyncratic construal of a poem, he is sometimes accused of "reading meanings into" the poem that are not "really there." But, because of the nature of language, all reading is reading in. Even if one sticks to the conventional, shared meanings of the words, one will necessarily be evoking all of the knowledge in the Schemas in which those words are defined. And in using one's natural capacity for metaphorical understanding, one will necessarily be engaging in an activity of con-
stmal. AU reading involves construal.
Linguists have discovered that no two speakers speak exacdy the same language. Each speaker of a language differs from all others in details of grammar, of word meaning, and
of conceptual structure.
Literary works, and poems in particular, are open to

THE POWER OF POETIC METAPHOR

widely varying constmals. For any given person, some constmals will seem more natural than others, and those are the ones that are often ascribed to the intention of the poet. But if we actuauy talk to contemporary poets about their poems, we find that the poet's most natural construals not be our own. That is normal, inevitable, and part of what makes poetry valuable and of lasting interest. Poems stand on their own. They evoke our constmals and those constmals are of value, whether they coincide with the author's or not. That is not to say that literary scholars should not engage in historical study that attempts to home in on the author's intended construals, to the extent Aat they can be pinned down. But that is a separate enterprise from what readers normally do when they encounter works of
literature.
Given that all reading involves construal, the question
arises as to what principles govern the nature of construal.
This book attempts to provide such principles in the area of
metaphor.

Tradidonal Views

To comprehend the power of metaphor, one must under-

stand its nature. We have devoted this chapter to character-

izing the nature of metaphor to the best of our abilities. But

our account of the nature of metaphor is by no means the

only one. There are traditional views that conflict with ours,

views that, on the basis of our best evidence, we believe are

mistaken. Indeed, one of the main reasons that we have

bothered to write this book is that we believe that such tra-

ditional views are in error. We will devote the remainder of I

this chapter to oudining those views and to explaining

where we think they go wrong.

l.

As we see it, there are sue fundamental positions that we

consider mistaken. The first, and biggest, mistake concerns

what has been called "literal meaning." The second is to fail

to seek general principles and to focus instead on individual

metaphorical expressions as if each were unique. The third

is a confusion between presendy existing conventional met-

l aphors and metaphors that once existed but no longer do,
the so-called "dead" metaphors. The fourth mistake is the
110

TRADITIONAL VIEWS
claim that metaphors do not have a source and a target domain, but are merely bidirectional linkages across domains. The fifth mistake is the claim that metaphor resides in lineuisric expressions alone and not in conceptual structure. Finally, the sbcth mistake is the claim that everything in lan-
re and thought is metaphorical, that there are no aspects of language or thought that are not metaphorical.
SEMANTIC AUTONOMY
The theoretical concept of literal meaning depends on the notion of semantic autonomy. An expression in a lanis semantically autonomous if it is meaningful comon its own terms. It follows that any expression that
is semantically autonomous does not derive any of its mean-
ing from metaphor. Nor does it derive its meaning through other conceptual relationships that stand outside of classical logic, such as metonymy, irony, conversational principles,
and so on.
Conceptual autonomy. There are two variants of the notion
of semantic autonomy. The first, concepmal autonomy, assumes that there are concepts and that words and phrases in
a language express concepts. Concepts are cognitive in nature; that is, they are part of human cognition. On this view, it is concepts, not words and phrases, that have meaning. Words and phrases are meaningful only via the concepts they express. Concepts are semandcally autonomous if they are meaningful completely on their own terms. The meaning of semantically autonomous concepts is, hence, independent of metaphor, metonymy, conversational principles, and so on. On this view, an expression of a language is semantically autonomous if the concept it expresses is semantically autonomous.
Nonconceptuiü autonomy. This variant assumes either that there are no such things as concepts, or that concepts play no role in characterizing meaning. It assumes that words and phrases in a language get their meaning via what they designate in the world, not via human cognition. Hence, the meaning of a semantically autonomous linguistic ex-

THE POWER OF POETIC METAPHOR
in the objective, mind-free world. If expressions of a lan. j guage are defined only in terms of a mind-free objective reality then metaphors cannot enter into the characterization of the meanings of linguistic expressions, since meta-
phors are not mind-free.
The major fallacy behind the Objectivist Claim is that it does not recognize that tmth and falsity are relative to conceptual frameworks. Thus, it fails to recognize that a
statement can be meaningful only relative to its definii
framework, and it can be tme or false only relative to the
way we understand reality given that framework. Since conceptual frameworks are products of the human mind, the
stmcture of reality as it is reflected in human language is
not objective in the technical sense, that is, not mind-frce.
Many of our concepmal frameworks are metaphorical in nature. When we conceptualize life as a journey or birth as arrival, then our statements about life or birth can be tme or false relative to those metaphorical concepmalizations.
For example, it can be true of someone that he has no direc-
tion in life or that he has taken a slow, hard path or that he
had a head start in life. But these things can be true only if
one conceptualizes life via the LIFE is A JOURNEY metaphor. Or if birth is conceptualized metaphorically as arrival here, then it is false that a newborn has just gone out of our life.
It is true that the infant has just come into our life. According to the Objectivist Claim, none of this makes
any sense. Truth and falsity are absolutes and cannot be
characterized relative to any metaphorical understanding.
Moreover, the Objectivist Claim entails that, if we under-
stand reality in terms of concepts within our conceptual system, then all such concepts can only be semantically autonomous and none are defined in terms of metaphor. Thus, the very idea that the concept of LIFE is understood metaphorically as a JOURNEY violates the Objectivist Claim, as does the idea that true or false statements might be rela-
üve to such an imderstanding.
Thus, if the arguments and analyses we have given so far in this book are correct, then the Autonomy and Objectivist
Claims must both be false. If these are false, then the Literal
u Meaning Theory is false. And if the Literal Meaning Theory 118

LITERAL MEANING VERSUS GROUNDING
It is important to see all the ways in which the Grounding
Hypothesis differs from Ac Literal Meaning Theory
First, the Grounding Hypothesis says that only some con-
cepts are semantically autonomous It is comPat:ible with
our view that most concepts are not semantically autono-
mous. This is very diflFerent from the Autonomy Claim of the Literal Meaning Theory, which says that all the con-
cepts conventionally expressed by the words and phrases in
a lSaencgounadg,ethareeGsreomuanndtiincgalHlyyapuottohneosmisoiussmdependent of the
Objectivist Claim, which entails that the meanings of aU cmoinncde-fpretsearreeaUchtya.raWcetesritzreodngvliyadreenfeyrethnacteatnodacnlaoibmjercattihvee,r
that what semantically autonomous concepts there are are
grounded in our patterns of bodily and social experience.
The Grounding Hypothesis does not require that the seman-
tically autonomous concepts be a direct mirror of a mind-
free external reality, as the Literal Meaning Theory does.
Third, the Grounding Hypothesis is about concepts, not
about language. The Grounding Hypothesis thus says nothimnganwthicaateUvyeraaubtoonuot wmhoeuths.erOannythIemGguriosuticndeixnpgreHssyipoontshaerseiss,ei-t
could be the case that every word or phrase in a language is

However, there are plenty of clear cases of basic conventional metaphors that are alive,— hundreds of them—certainly enough to show that what is
conventional and fixed need not be dead.
At this point we can see why the Dead Metaphor ' has been so popular. It is a consequence of the Literal
Meaning Theory. On the Literal Meaning Theory ordinary
conventional expressions cannot be metaphoric. Thus, if an

In recent years, historical smdy of how words change their meanings has shown that the Dead Metaphor Theo'ry
is false. Sweetser4 has shown that the same kinds of
meaning change recur over and over through the history
of the Indo-European languages. For example, words meaning "see" regularly acquire the meaning of "know" at
widely scattered times and places. The theory of conceptual
metaphor that we have advanced explains why this is so:
there is a widespread and ancient conceptual metaphor that
KNOWING IS SEEING. (CCWit" and "vision" have the same
Indo-European root.) Because that metaphor exists in the conceptual systems ofIndo-Eurpoean speakers, the conceptual mapping between seeing and knowing defines what Sweetser caüs a "pathway" for semantic change, so that as new words for seeing develop they evenmally extend their

niistake in the various theories of metaphor that is independent of the Literal Meaning Theory. Let us turn to it now.
THE INTERACTION THEORY
The Interaction Theory arises from a correct observation.
Suppose a source and target domain are linked by a conyendonal metaphor. Speaking about the source domain alone may bring to mind the target domain. For example an ex-
tensive discussion of a journey may lead one to reflect on the course of one's life. Given the theory we have advanced, this is not at all surprising: when metaphoric connections are conventionalized, they may become activated by discussion of the source domain alone. Discussing a particular
journey may activate the LIFE is A JOURNEY metaphor, resouf iatisnpgeicntsanofetfhfoerjdoeusrsneaynldinvdiermr daiusycuusnscioonnsocniotousasmpaepcptsinogf

Unfortunately, this very real phenomenon has been ana-
lyzed incorrecdy as follows: the target domain is described
as "suflFusing" the source domain, and it is claimed that the
metaphor is bidirectional—from target to source as weU as
from source to target. Indeed, according to this theory, there is no source or target. There is only a connection ( across domains, with one concept seen through the filter of the other. Here's what is wrong with such an analysis.
When we understand that life is a journey we stmcture
