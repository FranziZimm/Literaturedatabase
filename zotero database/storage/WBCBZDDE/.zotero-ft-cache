The Ecology of Language Evolution
This major new work explores the development of creoles and other new languages, focusing on the conceptual and methodological issues they raise for genetic linguistics. Written by an internationally renowned linguist, the book discusses the nature and signiﬁcance of internal and external factors – or “ecologies” – that bear on the evolution of a language. The book surveys a wide range of examples of changes in the structure, function and vitality of languages, and suggests that similar ecologies have played the same kinds of roles in all cases of language evolution. Drawing on major theories of language formation, macroecology and population genetics, Mufwene proposes a common approach to the development of creoles and other new languages. The Ecology of Language Evolution will be welcomed by students and researchers in creolistics, sociolinguistics, theoretical linguistics, and theories of evolution.

Preface
This book presents some of my positions over the past decade regarding the development of creole vernaculars in relation to language evolution in general. The latter notion is used here to cover long-term changes observable in the structures and pragmatics of a language, as well as the not-sounusual cases where a language speciates into daughter varieties identiﬁed at times as new dialects and at others as new languages. It also covers questions of language endangerment and death.
Together, these writings reﬂect the growth of my scholarship on, among other things, subjects conventionally identiﬁed as “creole genesis,”1 secondlanguage acquisition, and genetic linguistics. They are responses to some colleagues’ invitations that I propose a cogent alternative to hypotheses which I have disputed. Those responses boil down to the position that creoles are epistemologically special only by an accident of the way we have been doing linguistics, not because they have developed by any evolutionary processes that have not occurred in the developments of other languages, nor because their geneses are embedded in sociohistorical ecologies that are drastically diﬀerent in kind from those in which noncreole languages have evolved, nor even because they represent any global structural type of linguistic systems. They are as natural as noncreole languages. As a matter of fact, the better we understand them, the more we should be prompted to re-examine a number of things we thought we understood well about Language.
I have organized the essays chronologically, in the order in which they were written. I thought this the best way to capture progress in my thinking especially over the following topics: the development of creoles, the nature and signiﬁcance of language-contact ecology in determining their structures, whether or not similar ecologies have not played the same kinds of roles in the changes as have traditionally concerned genetic linguists, whether it is true that creoles are not genetically related to their lexiﬁers, and whether we should continue to treat them as “children out of wedlock.” Also, I try to answer the questions of what can we learn about language diversiﬁcation, and what light can research on the development of

Preface

creoles shed on the present heightened concern among linguists with language endangerment?
This selection also reveals that the enterprise I have embarked on is much more complex than the relevant literature has typically led us to believe. It seems necessary in diachronic linguistics to develop a research program of the same name as the title of this book, addressing the actuation question with the ecology of language evolution in focus. This amounts to paying attention not only to the socioeconomic and ethnographic environment in which a language has evolved (its external ecology) – such as the contact setting and power relations between groups of speakers – but also to the nature of the coexistence of the units and principles of a linguistic system before and/or during the change (its internal ecology). I argue that both external and internal ecologies play signiﬁcant roles in determining the evolutionary trajectories of a language, which I analogize with a biological parasitic species.
Inspired by population genetics, I capitalize on variation within a species, or within a larger population consisting of several coexistent species. I show how ecology rolls the dice in the competitions and selections which determine not only which of the competing languages prevails but also which units and principles are selected into the prevailing variety. Basically the same processes that produced creole vernaculars have also yielded new noncreole varieties from the same lexiﬁers during the same period of time. From the same perspective we can also understand what causes a language to thrive at the expense of others and conversely what erodes the vitality of a language in a particular socioeconomic ecology. While the chapters of this book show that these questions are all interrelated, they also reveal that I am just scraping the tip of the iceberg and much more work remains to be done, including rethinking some working assumptions of genetic linguistics. I introduce the issues more speciﬁcally in chapter 1.
Typically I use creoles as the starting point of my discussions, simply because this is where I have done more research and can pretend to understand anything about language evolution. I am otherwise pursuing the expected dialogue between research on speciﬁc languages and that on Language, focusing here on the contribution that scholarship on creoles can make to understanding Language. In the case of this book, things are somewhat complicated by the fact that creoles have been grouped together and distinguished from other languages more because of similarities in the sociohistorical conditions of their development than for any other convincing reason.
Contrary to what has often been claimed by several creolists, creole vernaculars are not abrupt evolutions, nor are they by-products of breaks in

the transmission of the languages from which they developed. A genetic connection is established between them most conspicuously by the fact that the overwhelming proportion of their vocabularies comes from these European languages, identiﬁed in this context as their lexiﬁers. The origins of creoles’ grammars are a more complex matter, but one can hardly deny the contributions of their heterogeneous nonstandard lexiﬁers to these new systems, derived by blending inheritance. Neither did creoles emerge in settings where there was no target, though one can concede that, given the availability of diverse varieties (native and non-native) of the lexiﬁer in the plantation colonies, such a target was deﬁnitely more diﬀused than in other cases of language transmission. Nor were these new vernaculars created by children; they would not be as complex as they are and they surely give no indication of being in an arrested developmental stage compared to noncreole languages. They are not the only cases of language restructuring – or system reorganization – prompted by contact, nor are the kinds of contact that motivated their developments diﬀerent from those that should be invoked in, for instance, the speciation of Vulgar Latin into the Romance languages.
In the way I identify them in chapter 1, creole vernaculars are new language varieties which originated in the appropriation of nonstandard varieties of Western European languages by populations that were not (fully) of European descent in seventeenth-to-nineteenth century European (sub)tropical colonies. Like any other vernacular that developed from a Western European language in the same (ex-)colonies, they have diverged structurally from the varieties spoken in Europe and from each other. Although it has typically been argued that some of the new vernaculars diﬀer from their metropolitan counterparts and from one another – some to a greater extent than others – there is no operational yardstick for this assessment, starting with the fact that the lexiﬁer was hardly the same from one setting to another. Mutual intelligibility is not reliable, especially since there are other colonial vernaculars spoken by descendants of Europeans that rate equally low on the mutual intelligibility scale but have not been identiﬁed as creoles, e.g., English in the Old Amish communities in North America. The main implicit criterion, which is embarrassing for linguistics but has not been discussed, is the ethnicity of their speakers. Most hypotheses proposed in creolistics to account for the development of creoles would have been better thought out, had it not been partly for this factor, as strong as my accusation may sound. The other reasons are given below and discussed in the following chapters.
I have been encouraged in the approach presented in this book by questions which research on the emergence of creoles has shown to be relevant to understanding language evolution but which appear to have been unduly

Preface

overlooked in genetic linguistics, for instance: the role of ecology in language speciation. The essays included in this book reﬂect an eﬀort to prevent creolistics from simply being a consumer subdiscipline which espouses gratuitously, without questions asked, some still-unjustiﬁed working assumptions and theoretical models accepted in other subdisciplines of linguistics. Like any of these, creolistics should contribute to understanding Language in part by highlighting those assumptions about this peculiarity of humans which are not supported by any creole data.
Five of the following chapters (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6) have been published as self-contained essays in diﬀerent fora. Perhaps just a handful of creolists who share my research interests have read them all as covering inter-related topics. The purpose of this book is to make them more accessible and highlight the unifying threads that link them. They are complemented here with some recent, hitherto unpublished essays (chapters 1, 7, and 8) which continue the unfolding of my research program on language evolution and my eﬀort to bridge topics on the development of creoles with issues in genetic linguistics and on language endangerment. Those who have read at least some of the previously published essays should know that these have been revised, sometimes extensively, to keep up with my current thinking on the subject matter. I have used this opportunity to clarify some earlier positions, to correct some mistakes that I recognize, or simply to restate things more accurately. I have also made every eﬀort to make the book less repetitive, by crossreferencing the chapters and excising portions of the original essays that became redundant under the same cover.
The approach to language evolution presented here owes part of its present form to Bill Smith (Piedmont College) and Chuck Peters (University of Georgia). The ﬁrst encouraged me to read literature on chaos theory (given my interest in nonrectilinear and nonunilinear evolutionary paths) and the second introduced me to ecology and population genetics. I have also beneﬁted enormously from discussions with Bill Wimsatt (University of Chicago). Thanks to him, I gave up unsuccessful attempts to clone the linguistic species on the biological species (which one?) and developed my own notion of a linguistic species with its own kinds of peculiarities, especially feature transmission properties. Not all species evolve according to the same principles. It is thus as normal for linguistic species to reproduce themselves according to their own patterns of feature transmission and evolutionary principles as it is for bacterial species to diﬀer in the same respects from animal species. It remains that all evolution presupposes variation within the relevant species, heredity (or generational continuity) of features, and diﬀerential reproduction, while being subject to various ecological factors. Chapters 1, 2, and 6 have beneﬁted in clarity from the Ecology of Language Evolution course that I taught in

Spring 1999 and from the Biological and Cultural Evolution course that Bill, Jerry Sadock, and I taught in Autumn 1999. They have also beneﬁted from generous comments from Robert Perlman (biologist, University of Chicago) and from Manuel O. Dìaz (geneticist, Loyola University of Chicago).
My general thinking on several genetic linguistic issues owes a lot to discussions and friendship with several other colleagues, chieﬂy, the late Guy Hazaël-Massieux, Robert Chaudenson, Louis-Jean Calvet (all of the Université d’Aix-en-Provence), and Sali Tagliamonte (University of York). Sali also encouraged me the most consistently to bring the present essays together in the form of a book, as she thought it was time I started outlining the big picture that should be emerging from them. Eyamba Bokamba and Braj Kachru (University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign) were especially helpful in inviting me to test my hypotheses against the development of indigenized Englishes. They oﬀered me the right conference platforms where I was prompted to think of the big picture and situate problems of the development of creoles in those of language evolution in general, and thus to relate genetic creolistics to genetic linguistics.
Several of my discussions in chapter 1 owe part of their substance and clarity to questions from Michel DeGraﬀ (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), Marlyse Baptista (University of Georgia), and Rakesh Bhatt (University of Illinois at Urbana), mostly from the point of view of theoretical linguistics. They reminded me that I address scholars of diverse persuasions and backgrounds in my essays and that I cannot take it for granted that other creolists, let alone other linguists and nonlinguists, share my working assumptions or know what I am talking about. I was served this message again by Bernd Heine (University of Cologne) and Richard C. Lewontin (Harvard), in their comments on the last draft of the same chapter. I hope that thanks to all of them my positions are presented more clearly and accessibly to readers of diﬀerent backgrounds.
Among my students at the University of Chicago, oﬀ of whom I bounced several of my earlier “heresies” and who knew the right questions to ask, Chris Corcoran and Sheri Pargman deserve special mention. They read a few drafts of subsets of the present essays and pointed out unclarities and omissions, which I hope do not stand out any more, at least not as eyesores. Drew Clark, a ﬁrst-year graduate student of mine, decided that reading the whole manuscript and checking its accessibility was a reasonable way of not getting bored during his 1999–2000 Christmas break. I could not have had a more dedicated style reader. I feel equally indebted to Citi Potts for carefully copy-editing the essays with a keen eye on their accessibility.

included in the inset in chapter 1. She was very good in implementing cartographically ideas I expressed verbally. A month of residence as a Visiting Scientist at the Max Planck Institute in Leipzig in May 2000 enabled me to complete the preparation of this book. To all the above individuals and institutions, and to several colleagues whose names I cannot continue listing and who have assisted me one way or another, especially in challenging me with alternative views, I feel very much indebted. I assume alone full responsibility for all the remaining shortcomings.
Last but not least, I am deeply indebted to Tazie and Pat for accommodating me with more time than I could have aﬀorded to write these essays and revise them. Time has been more than a highly priced commodity during the last phase of this exercise, while chairing a prestigious linguistics department in a tragic and daunting transition, after the death of a dear colleague and former major professor, Jim McCawley, whose practice of linguistics was absolutely encyclopedic and very inspiring to me. My days too last twenty-four hours. I could not have accomplished this project without Tazie’s and Pat’s concessions in family time, even after I have cheated myself of indispensable sleep time.
I hope this end result does not let down most of you family, friends, colleagues, and students who have supported me all along, as well as you interested readers who are patient enough to explore the workings of my occasionally contentious mind.

1 Introduction
This chapter is written primarily to clarify concepts such as “ecology,” “evolution,” and “language,” which are central to the book. It also states some of my most important arguments, e.g., (1) creoles have developed by the same restructuring processes that mark the evolutions of noncreole languages; (2) contact is an important factor in all such developments; and (3) the external ecological factors that bear on restructuring also bear on aspects of language vitality, among which is language endangerment. I will go beyond the brief explanations given in the Preface but will not pre-empt the more elaborate discussions presented in, for instance, chapters 2 and 6. In the present chapter, I simply provide basic information that readers will ﬁnd useful to understand the book.
1.1 Communal languages as ensembles of I-languages
To the lay person the term language means something like “way of speaking.” Thus English originally meant “the way the English people speak” and kiSwahili “the way the waSwahili speak.” In the case of kiSwahili, the Bantu noun class system makes it clear through the instrumental preﬁx ki-, which suggests a means used by waSwahili to communicate. Those more knowledgeable about communication extend the notion “language” beyond the spoken mode, applying it also to written and signed means.
Linguists have focused more on the abstract systems that generate utterances and written or signed strings of symbols identiﬁed as English, American Signed Language, or the like in lay speech. The systems consist of sets of units and principles, which are selected and applied diﬀerently from one language to another, despite many similarities. The units are identiﬁable in various interfacing modules: e.g., the phonological system (dealing with sounds), the morphological system (dealing with minimal meaningful combinations of sounds), and syntax (how words combine into sentences). Some principles are generally combinatoric, in the form of positive rules and negative constraints on how the units can combine together into larger units. Some others are distributive, specifying, for instance, how the phoneme /t/ in American English is pronounced diﬀerently in words such as
1

Introduction

tea, state, and water, viz., aspirated before a stressed vowel, unaspirated after /s/ regardless of what follows, often with unreleased air at the end of a word, and as a ﬂap between a stressed and an unstressed vowel.
Language change is generally about diﬀerent aspects of linguistic systems. For the purposes of language transmission from one group of speakers to another,1 any of these units and principles may be identiﬁed as a linguistic feature, roughly on the model of gene in biology. Let us bear in mind that the notion of linguistic species proposed below need not be analogous to that of biological species in all respects, not any more than there is an empirically validated uniﬁed notion of biological species in the ﬁrst place.
Quite germane to some of my arguments about language evolution is Chomsky’s (1986:19–24) distinction between internalized language (I-language) and externalized language (E-language). An I-language is basically an idiolect, an individual speaker’s system of a language. It is to a language what an individual is to a species in population genetics. Among the questions I address are the following: How and when can features of individual idiolects be extrapolated as characteristic of a language as a communal system? Is knowledge of a language as a property of an individual speaker coextensive with knowledge of a language as a property of a population? What is the status of variation in the two cases and how does it bear on language evolution?
Chomsky deﬁnes an “E-language” as the set of sentences produced by a population speaking a particular language. This conception of a language is inadequate (McCawley 1976). Chomsky is correct in rejecting it as leading the linguist nowhere toward understanding how language works in the mind. It just provides data for analysis. Fortunately, few linguists have subscribed to this notion of a language. Most linguists have been Saussurean, both in treating languages as mental systems and in assuming them to be social institutions to which speakers are enculturated. Meanwhile they have failed to address the following question: What role do individual speakers play in language change? This question is central to language evolution and I return to it below.2
Idiolects and communal languages represent diﬀerent levels of abstraction. The former are ﬁrst-level abstractions from speech, the latter are extrapolations that can be characterized as ensembles of I-languages. Neil Smith (1999:138) denies the validity of “collective language.” However, we cannot speak of language change or evolution, which is identiﬁed at the population level, without accepting the existence of a communal language.
To be sure, a communal language is an abstraction inferred by the observer. It is an extrapolation from I-languages whose speakers communicate successfully with each other most of the time. It is internalized to the extent that we can also project a collective mind that is an ensemble of individual minds in a population. Since this higher-level abstraction is what

discussions of language change are based on, I capitalize on interidiolectal variation, among other properties of communal languages, and argue in chapter 6 that a language is a species. I will then use the competition-andselection dynamics of the coexistence of I-languages to explain how a language evolves over time.
Two questions arise from this position: (i) Is every feature that is true of a communal language qua species also necessarily true of I-languages? For instance, does the fact that the following sentences are acceptable in some nonstandard English dialects necessarily make them well formed in all English idiolects or even dialects?

(1)

I ain’t told you no such thing.

“I haven’t told you such a thing” or “I didn’t tell you such a thing.”

(2)

Let me tell you everything what Allison said at the party.

“Let me tell you everything that Allison said at the party.”

(ii) When do changes that aﬀect individual members amount to communal changes?
As noted above, the latter level of change is among the phenomena I identify as language evolution. This can also involve nonstructural changes, for instance, the acceptability of peculiarities of the sentences in (1–2) for a larger or smaller proportion of speakers in a community. This book says almost nothing about such nonstructural changes. However, much attention is devoted to speciation, when, for structural or ideological reasons, it is found more appropriate to no longer group together I-languages that used to form one communal language. Rather, they are classed into subgroups identiﬁed as separate languages or as dialects of the same language. This is precisely where the identiﬁcation of creoles as separate languages ﬁts, in contrast with the equally novel and contact-based varieties of European languages spoken by descendants of Europeans (e.g., American English and Québécois French) which have been identiﬁed as dialects of their lexiﬁers (chapters 4–5). I return to these questions in sections 1.3 and 1.4.

1.2 Pidgins, creoles, and koinés
Pidgins and koinés play a very negligible part in the next chapters. However, it is diﬃcult to deﬁne creoles without mentioning them and it is almost impossible to make sense of some of the issues I raise in this book without also clarifying the conceptual distinction between creoles and koinés. There is a genetic relationship between these two, because the lexiﬁers of creoles, those varieties from which they have inherited most of their vocabularies, have often been correctly identiﬁed as colonial koinés. These are compromise varieties from among diverse dialects of the same language. Instead of selecting one single dialect as their lingua franca, speakers of the European

Introduction

lexiﬁers wound up developing a new colonial dialect which included their common features but only some of those that distinguished them from one another. Such selections did not necessarily originate from the same dialect, nor were they the same from one colony to another – a fact that accounts in part for regional variation. Why those particular selections were made and not others is a question that deserves as much attention as the selections that produced diﬀerent creoles from the same lexiﬁer (chapters 2 and 3). The inset text sheds some light on this question.

Restructuring into koinés, creoles and other varieties
These three diagrams illustrate dialect and language contact where creoles developed. They suggest that basically the same mechanisms were involved in the restructuring processes which produced creoles as in those which generated koinés. They show that the contact of the different metropolitan varieties brought over by the European colonists (represented in the upper tiers) produced the “feature pool” shown by the box in the middle tiers. The outputs (represented in the bottom tiers) are the local, colonial varieties as they developed in forms that differed from the metropolitan varieties.There is no particular input-to-output ratio of number of varieties. There may be fewer outputs than input varieties and vice versa, just as the number may be equal. What matters is that the structures of the output and input varieties are not identical.

The middle tiers represents the “arena” where features associated with the same or similar grammatical functions came to compete with each other. It is also the locus of “blending inheritance,” in that features which are similar but

not necessarily identical came to reinforce each other, regardless of their sources, and produced modiﬁed variants of the originals in the emergent varieties. The outputs represent variation in the ways particular (combinations of) features were selected into the emergent varieties, according to principles that still must be articulated more explicitly as we get to understand language evolution more adequately. Markedness has been proposed to be among those principles, but the subject matter can also be approached with alternative constraint models, as long as they account for the speciﬁc choices made by speakers of particular varieties. The diagrams also suggest that there is little in the structures of the new vernaculars that has not been “recycled” from the lexiﬁer and/or the other languages it came in contact with. What makes the new varieties restructured is not only the particular combinations of features selected, often from different sources, into the new language varieties but also the way in which the features themselves have been modiﬁed, “exapted,” to ﬁt into the new systems.

The ﬁrst diagram represents what has been identiﬁed as koinéization. It diverges from the established position that koinés develop by leveling out differences among dialects of the same language or among genetically and typologically related languages, and by reducing the varieties in contact to their common denominator. This is not what has been observed in places where, for instance, English dialects in England have been in contact with each other. The outcomes show apparent replacive adoptions by some dialects of elements from other dialects, more like the results of competition and selection than any kind of common denominators of the dialects in contact. Simpliﬁcation of morphosyntax in the development of the original koiné in the Hellenic world did not amount to a common denominator of

Introduction

Greek dialects. After all cross-dialectal variation had been eliminated, it would have consisted of a skeletal basic system that probably would not have been helpful to the Greeks themselves, barring any concurrent drastic changes in their world view. The name left alone, koinéization is but the restructuring of a language into a new dialect out of the contact of its preexisting dialects or, by extension, the development of a new language variety out of the contact of genetically and typologically related languages.

The other two diagrams illustrate what happened when those metropolitan dialects of a prevailing European language came in contact with other languages. Since linguistic features are abstractions that are in a way different from the forms that carry them, those other languages too made their contribution to the feature pool, increasing the complexity of the condition of competition. Thus they bore on the structures of the outcome varieties, making allowance for selection of features from outside the range provided by the metropolitan dialects of the lexiﬁer. For instance, languages that allow copula-less adjectival predicates would make this syntactic option an alternative for the colonial varieties of the lexiﬁer. In some cases they simply favored an option that was already available in some of the metropolitan varieties but was statistically too insigniﬁcant to produce the same output under different ecological conditions. The colonial varieties of European languages reﬂect this more complex level of feature competition. Thus aside from the social bias in the naming practice, the diachronic difference between koinés, creoles, and other new varieties lies not in the restructuring process but in the numbers and kinds of languages that came in contact, and sadly also in the ethnic identities of their typical speakers.

1.2 Pidgins, creoles, and koinés

7

What I present below about pidgins and creoles is only a brief summary of what is discussed in substantial detail in Mühlhäusler (1986), Chaudenson (1992), and Mufwene (1997a). Pidgins have traditionally been characterized as reduced linguistic systems which are used for speciﬁc communicative functions, typically in trade between speakers of diﬀerent, mutually unintelligible languages. They are second-language varieties that developed in settings where the speakers of the lexiﬁer had only sporadic contacts with the populations they traded with. The adoption of the lexiﬁer as a lingua franca by multilingual populations who had little exposure to ﬂuent models accounts in part for its reduced and, to some linguists such as Bickerton (1981, 1984, 1999) and Holm (1988), seemingly chaotic structure.
Although part of colonial history has tied the development of pidgins with slavery, the connection is accidental. In trades between the Europeans and Native Americans, fur was the chief indigenous commodity. On the West coast of Africa, not only slaves but also food supplies (especially along the “Grain Coast”), ivory, and gold were traded. The common denominator is the sporadic pattern of the trade contacts and this is equally true of those varieties identiﬁed pejoratively by the French colonists or travelers as baragouins “gibberish, broken language” and more commonly by others as jargon, with almost the same meaning.
In many parts of the world, as in Nigeria, Cameroon, and Papua New Guinea, pidgins have increased their communicative functions and are also spoken both as mother tongues for large proportions of their populations and as major lingua francas. They are called expanded pidgins. The stabilization and complexiﬁcation of their systems have to do less with nativization than with more regular usage and increased communicative functions.
Creoles have been deﬁned as nativized pidgins. Aside from the arguments presented below against this position, it is useful to consider the following. If creoles had really been developed by children, they would be languages in arrested development stage (Mufwene 1999a). The alternative is that they would have acquired adult structures when the children became adults, which raises the question of why their parents would have been incapable of developing such structures during the pidgin stage. Would slavery have aﬀected their language faculties so adversely?
The irony of deriving creoles from pidgins lies partly in the fact that the term pidgin (from the English word business, in the phrase business English) emerged only in 1807 (Baker and Mühlhäusler 1990), over one century since the term creole had been used in Romance languages for a vernacular. The date of 1825 reported by the OED for creole applies to English only. In the colonies where new vernaculars which developed from European languages were identiﬁed by laymen as creoles or patois the term pidgin is nowhere attested in reference to earlier stages of their developments. Besides, the ﬁrst variety to have been identiﬁed as pidgin English

Introduction

(< business English) developed in Canton in the late eighteenth century, long after most creoles had developed. Moreover, no creole has been identiﬁed in that part of the world.
These arguments are not intended to deny the plausible hypothesis that those who contributed the most to the restructuring of the European languages into the classic creoles (e.g., Jamaican, Guyanese, Gullah, Mauritian, Seychellois, and Papiamentu) must have gone through interlanguage stages. However, interlanguages are individual phenomena, restricted to the development of I-languages. They are based on no communal norm, especially in the settings where the creoles developed (chapter 2). In this respect, they are very much unlike the pidgins as communal systems.
The socioeconomic history of European colonization suggests a territorial division of labor between the places where creoles developed and those where pidgin and indigenized varieties of European languages did. The best known pidgins developed in European trade colonies of Africa and the Paciﬁc (around trade forts and on trade routes), before they were appropriated politically and expanded into exploitation colonies in the second half of the nineteenth century.3 They were based on the nonstandard vernaculars spoken by the European traders, to which their nonEuropean counterparts were exposed during their occasional mercantile encounters. Although they have often evolved structurally and ethnographically to serve diverse and more complex communicative functions, originally they were indeed structurally reduced and served very basic and limited communicative functions. Note that in trade transactions nonverbal communication often compensates for shortcomings in the verbal mode (Calvet 1999).
During the exploitation colony period, when territories larger than the original trade colonies were under the administrative control of European nations, scholastic varieties of their languages were introduced through the scholastic medium, so that they could serve as lingua francas between the indigenous colonial auxiliaries and the colonizers. Owing to regional multilingualism, the colonial rankings of languages led the emerging local elite to appropriate these scholastic varieties as lingua francas for communication among themselves too. This process nurtured their indigenization into what is now identiﬁed with geographical names such as Nigerian, Indian, and East African Englishes.
In places like Nigeria and Cameroon, Pidgin English and the local indigenized English varieties have coexisted happily, with the pidgin almost identiﬁed as an indigenous language (vernacular for some but lingua franca for others) while the indigenized variety is associated with the intellectual elite. An important diﬀerence remains between, on the one hand, pidgins (including also West African “français tirailleur” and “le français populaire d’Abidjan”) and, on the other, indigenized varieties of European languages

(e.g., Indian English and African French), lying in the following fact: the former’s lexiﬁers are nonstandard varieties, whereas the latter have developed from the scholastic English or French introduced through the school system, usually through teachers who were not native speakers. See, e.g., Kachru (1983), Gupta (1991), and Bamgbose et al. (1995) on the latter varieties.
Pidgins in the Americas developed out of similar trade contacts between Europeans and Native Americans, before the latter were absorbed by the expanding European settlements. However, creoles developed in settlement colonies, marked by contacts that were initially regular and intimate between the slaves and the European colonists. Most of these were indentured servants and a large proportion of them did not speak the European lexiﬁer natively (chapter 2). Like pidgins, creoles too had nonstandard lexiﬁers.
The socioeconomic histories of the New World and Indian Ocean, on which our heuristic prototypes of creoles are based,4 do not suggest that these vernaculars have any structural features which are not attested in pidgins (Mufwene 1991a; Baker 1995a), nor that creoles developed (necessarily) from pidgins (Alleyne 1971, 1980; Chaudenson 1979, 1992), nor that creoles developed by nativization, as acquisition of a community of native speakers, from any erstwhile pidgins (Mufwene 1999a, contra Bickerton 1999). In the New World, it is not obvious that European-lexiﬁer jargons or pidgins spoken by Native Americans contributed more than some lexical entries to the creoles developed by the African slaves. From the founding stages of the colonies until the times when these new vernaculars developed, the Africans interacted regularly with speakers of the lexiﬁers, although these were not always native or ﬂuent speakers (chapter 2).
Creole vernaculars, originally conﬁned to plantations of the Atlantic and Indian Ocean island and coastal colonies, emerged in contact settings where the development of pidgins would be inconsistent with the received doctrine that they are reduced systems for limited and specialized communicative functions. Creole populations, those born in the settlement colonies from at least one nonindigenous parent,5 preceded the emergence of creole vernaculars, in the homestead conditions in which non-Europeans were minorities and well integrated, though socially discriminated against. They had full access to European languages, albeit their colonial, koiné varieties, which they acquired through regular interactions with their native or ﬂuent speakers, just like European indentured servants did (Tate 1965; Chaudenson 1979, 1989, 1992; Berlin 1998; Corne 1999). They did not speak the varieties identiﬁed later on as creoles.
It was indeed later approximations of their colonial vernaculars by slaves of the plantation period which produced creole vernaculars, through what Lass (1997:112) characterizes as “imperfect replication” and Deacon (1997:114) as “transmission error.” This process was intensiﬁed this time by

10

Introduction

the decreasing disproportion of native and ﬂuent speakers (creole and seasoned slaves) relative to nonproﬁcient speakers (the bozal slaves). As discussed in chapter 2, the basilectalization process that produced creoles was gradual.6 However, avoiding treating it as a regular case of language evolution, some creolists (e.g., Bickerton 1984; Thomason and Kaufman 1988) have characterized the process as abrupt. Ironically, there is no evidence that, for example, Gullah – the creole of coastal South Carolina and Georgia in the USA – developed more rapidly than any other North American English variety. Nor has it been proved that the evolution that produced it was not as gradual as those that yielded other contemporary English varieties, which developed between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries.7
The development of creoles has also been associated with a break in the transmission of the lexiﬁer (e.g., Polomé 1983). There is, however, hardly any evidence of this, even in polities such as Suriname, where native and large proportions of speakers of the lexiﬁer left roughly ﬁfteen years after the colony was founded in the mid-seventeenth century. A break in the transmission of the lexiﬁer would have entailed no exposure to any form of the language and therefore nothing to restructure. This is quite diﬀerent from the historical reality that the slaves who arrived during the plantation period were exposed to varieties more and more diﬀerent from the languages brought from Europe or spoken in earlier colonial periods.
As noted above, the earliest documentation of the term pidgin is reported to be 1907 (Baker and Mühlhäusler 1990). This was over two hundred years after the term creole had been in usage in reference to colonial language varieties, in contradistinction from the metropolitan ways. Linguists have posited in anachronistic order the dubious developmental link between pidgins and creoles. No evidence other than that pidgins have more reduced systems than creoles has been adduced.
In the absence of evidence of structural features peculiar to creoles (Mufwene 1986a, 2000a), Chaudenson’s (1992) characterization that creoles are speciﬁc vernaculars which are deﬁned by the time, place, and conditions of their development seems correct. They emerged during the European colonization of the rest of the world starting in the seventeenth century, typically on island or coastal colonies between the tropics, in the contact settings of plantations. In these places, the non-European labor outnumbered even the European indentured servants, not only the native speakers of the lexiﬁer. The creoles developed during a period when the populations were also racially segregated and grew more by importations of new labor than by birth.
Consequently, I use the term creole in its sociohistorical sense to identify primarily those varieties that have been identiﬁed as “creole” or “patois” by nonlinguists. I use it also loosely for varieties such as Gullah, which linguists

1.3 Language evolution

11

have identiﬁed as creoles because they developed under conditions similar to varieties such as Louisiana, Haitian, and Mauritian Creoles. Although I claim in Mufwene (1997a) that creole vernaculars were originally associated with creole populations, Chaudenson (p.c., October 1999) has reminded me that in Martinique the classic creole populations are White, called Beke, and are not the ones primarily associated with Martinican Creole. In Louisiana, Creole is associated only with Black creole populations but not with the White ones; and in Mauritius the creole population is of Black African ancestry, while Creole is claimed by Mauritians of diverse ethnic groups to be their national language. The historical practice of identifying some new colonial vernaculars as creoles does not have the kind of logic that linguists have mistakenly invoked to justify it. Thus, I will resist applying the term creole to contact varieties which developed in continental Africa, because there were no European settlement colonies there, except in South Africa, where the identiﬁcation of Afrikaans as a creole remains controversial. No creole populations in the historical sense developed in the rest of continental Africa, and European languages were not appropriated as vernaculars by the indigenous Africans.8 Identifying varieties such as (Kikongo-)Kituba, Lingala, and Sango, which were lexiﬁed by indigenous African languages, as creoles just adds more confusion (Mufwene 1997a). Though they show some similarities in patterns of morphosyntactic restructuring, they also show some important structural diﬀerences from classic creoles (for instance in the domain of time reference).9 As I argue in chapters 3, 4, and 5, the fact that more general explanations can be proposed for some structural evolutions attested both in classic creoles and in other languages is good reason not to assume a dubious structural process of “creolization.”

1.3 Language evolution
As in biology, I use the term evolution without suggesting progress of any kind from a less satisfactory state to a more satisfactory one (e.g., Gould 1993:303), nor necessarily from a simpler to a more complex system or vice versa.10 Evolution has no goal, certainly not to repair any putative deﬁciencies in a language. Linguistic change is inadvertent, a consequence of “imperfect replication” in the interactions of individual speakers as they adapt their communicative strategies to one another or to new needs. Such adaptations are similar to exaptations in biology or perhaps to kludges in computing. They can introduce generalizations or increase irregularities, just as they can introduce or obliterate useful distinctions (Keller 1994; Croft 2000).
Since linguistic change occurs even when no contact of languages is involved, it is evident that non-native speakers of a language are not the

12

Introduction

only ones that acquire it imperfectly. One must remember that idiolects of language are not identical. The mutual accommodations that speakers make to each other and their nonidentical creative innovations set in motion constant competition-and-selection processes that bring about changes of all kinds. Those changes that spread from some I-languages to become exclusive, dominant, minority, or latent patterns in the communal language are the focus of this book. They are like those microevolutionary processes that become signiﬁcant at the macroevolutionary level when they justify positing speciation. For instance, in the history of the English language, we may consider as speciation the kinds of changes that started in adaptive manipulations of the colonial English systems by individual speakers and amounted to the development of recent varieties like Jamaican Patwa, Jamaican English, Gullah, African-American vernacular English (AAVE), Appalachian English, and why not New England’s English or English in the Bronx? It is of course necessary to invoke ecology to account for such speciation, and I return to this topic below.
By evolution, I mean no more than the long-term changes undergone by a language (variety) over a period of time. They involve a succession of restructuring processes which produce more and more deviations from an earlier stage. Restructuring itself amounts to a reorganization of the mechanical system of a language and/or of the pragmatic principles regulating its use. The process is in fact similar to genetic recombination in biology, in which “the parental chromosomes are broken and reassembled” (Mayr 1997:188). An important diﬀerence is that language transmission is not necessarily on the parent-to-oﬀspring model. As a matter of fact, language transmission is primarily horizontal. It is variably polyploidic, without a limit on the number of individuals or groups that can pass features on to a speaker’s idiolect. Moreover, despite numerous recent useful invocations of apparent time in quantitative sociolinguistics to prove systemic change (e.g., Bailey and Maynor 1987, 1989),11 the development of an idiolect does not really end until its speaker either dies or becomes linguistically disabled, even though most of the linguistic system is formed by puberty. Some linguistic features are acquired additively or replacively several times in a speaker’s life, although in the vast majority of cases most of these changes bear no signiﬁcant eﬀect on the basic system developed by puberty. In this respect, a linguistic species is like a Lamarckian species (chapter 6).
Syntactic examples of adaptations which amount to system restructuring include uses of a word meaning “say” not only as a verb but also as a complementizer after verbs of saying and of perception, as in the following Gullah sentences (represented in eye dialect using deliberate distortions of standard English spellings to suggest a diﬀerent pronunciation):

a. Faye answer say Robert coming. “Faye answered that Robert was/is

coming.”

b. Uh hear say Robert coming. “I heard that Robert was/is coming.”

In the present case, the adaptations amount to the new uses into which the verb say is put that are not attested in the lexiﬁer. The verb say is commonly used in all English dialects to introduce reported speech quotatively or indirectly (followed by that or a null complementizer in the latter case). However, it is not used as a serial verb (3a), nor as a complementizer (3b). Moreover, whoever is tempted to infer that “say” has replaced the complementizer that in English creoles should remember that it is not used to introduce relative clauses or other complements in complex noun phrases (Mufwene 1989a). The relative clause in (4c) is illformed.

a. This da young man come yah yesiday.

“This [is] the young man [that] came here yesterday.”

b. This da young man weh come yah yesiday.

“This [is] the young man who came here yesterday.”

c. *This da young man say come yah yesiday.

“This [is] the young man that came here yesterday.”

In this case, the subsystem of English complementizers has simply been reorganized to assign to say a subset of the contexts in which the English complementizer that would occur but certainly not all such contexts. For the purposes of this book, any change in the structural system of a language involves restructuring, including loss of some units or rules, addition of new ones, and certainly modiﬁcations in the direction of simpliﬁcation, generalization, or complexiﬁcation by the addition of conditions to the application of a rule.
A set of basic evolutionary questions that have retained much of my attention include the following: Are the restructuring processes that produced creole vernaculars diﬀerent, in kind or in speed, from those that produced other new varieties of European languages during the same period in the colonies or even earlier in Europe (chapters 3, 4, and 5)? Is it plausible to assume that vernaculars such as Jamaican Patwa and Louisiana Creole developed faster than Jamaican English and Louisiana French varieties? Or is it more accurate to assume that they developed concurrently and that evolutionary speed has nothing to do with whether or not a new variety should, or should not, be called a creole? Is there any justiﬁcation for the position that “classic creoles” developed abruptly, over one generation (Bickerton 1981, 1984, 1999), while languages such as French took centuries to evolve into what they are like today?
I argue in chapter 2 that creoles evolved gradually, just like the Romance languages, for instance. As a matter of fact, the speed of restructuring into

14

Introduction

a new system does not matter, since it depends largely on the ecology in which a language evolves. Besides, it is hard to argue that Jamaican Patwa or Gullah developed faster than Jamaican English or White American English varieties, respectively. Chapters 3, 4, and 5, deal with diﬀerent aspects of this subject matter.
One can also ask whether there is a global restructuring process that can be called creolization, which changes a noncreole language wholesale into a creole. Such a hypothesis does not seem to account for crosscreole variation in domains such as time reference and number delimitation, where putatively “creole features” vary in some respects (Mufwene 1991a). For example, Papiamentu has an               (a “noncreole” feature) but does not have an  marker. Likewise, Gullah has an indeﬁnite article (a “noncreole” feature) – in the form of a schwa, as in (other) English dialects – whereas it is debatable whether Jamaican and Guyanese Creoles’ wan is really an article or a regular quantiﬁer.
There are several other interesting questions. For instance: Is contact so peculiar to creoles and other “mixed languages” as to make them evolutionarily unique compared to other languages? Are the language-level contacts that produced them diﬀerent in kind from those which produced the Romance languages, for instance, or those occurring among idiolects? Are idiolect contacts not as much responsible for internally motivated change as for the externally motivated changes associated with the development of creoles? Recall that it is typically the small acts of individuals, or the eﬀects of the ecology on them, which wind up having wide-ranging eﬀects on the overall population. The dynamic of this has been identiﬁed as the “invisible/hidden hand.”
As observed by Weinreich (1953), contact takes place in the mind of the speaker. Relevant to this book is also James Milroy’s (1997:311) view that “linguistic change is speaker-based,” which is also consistent with my position that communal languages are abstract extrapolations from idiolects. Moreover, it is dubious whether real co-ordinate bilingualism exists, in which linguistic systems are kept separate. Thus, how much sense does it make to speak of language contact as a separate phenomenon from the contact of idiolects? Speakers are central to bringing idiolects, dialects, and languages into contact while communicating with each other. Chapters 2 and 6 capitalize on this peculiarity to explain the means by which languages evolve.
It is now critical to explain the analogy between a communal language and a biological species as an ensemble of individuals. Although a detailed discussion is presented in chapter 6, the practical organization of this book calls for a sketchy and complementary introduction for chapters 2–5 at this stage.

1.4 Thinking of a language as a species

1.4 Thinking of a language as a species
Traditionally, a language has been analogized to an organism.12 This position has artiﬁcially prevented historical linguists from identifying the real causes of internally motivated change – what they consider to be “normal” or “regular” kinds of change, in opposition to externally motivated change, triggered by contact with another language. The causation actually lies in the competition and selection that arise from the communicative system(s) available to speakers, and in both the accommodations they make to each other and the adjustments that they make to new communicative needs in their speech acts. Language or dialect boundaries are osmotic, as evidenced by research on code-mixing. Thus speakers’ mutual accommodations and adjustments to new communicative needs can draw materials from either the same linguistic system or separate ones.
This alternative perspective entails questioning the distinction between internally and externally motivated change. In fact this distinction becomes a moot question under the assumption that a language is a species. Contact among idiolects and the ensuing competition and selection in the means available to their speakers become the default causation for change. Thus what McMahon (1994:248) identiﬁes as “the real actuation question” becomes more signiﬁcant: “why [do] some of these innovations die out and others catch on, spreading through the community, or why [do] certain instances of variation become changes and others don’t[?]” These well-justiﬁed questions apply better to a language conceived of as an ensemble of idiolects than to a language regarded as an organism without internal variation.
The same assumption that a language is an organism has also prevented genetic linguists from explaining adequately why linguistic speciation occurs in the ﬁrst place. Geographical dispersal and/or separation alone do not explain why Proto-Indo-European or Proto-Bantu diverged into so many diﬀerent languages, especially if the proto-language is assumed to have been homogeneous. Could random evolution alone, acting on an erstwhile uniﬁed and uniform proto-system, really have led to so much diversity without the intervention of ecology? Or, as suggested by Trubetzkoy (1939) about Proto-Indo-European, was the proto-language itself already heterogeneous and was subsequent speciation the consequence of dynamics of interaction within that internal diversity, with or without the contribution of ecology? Didn’t language contact have any role to play in the speciation of Proto-Germanic or Proto-Bantu into the diﬀerent Germanic or Bantu subfamilies and individual languages? Did speakers of the proto-languages disperse into uninhabited territories? These questions deserve more attention than they have received in genetic linguistics. Chapters 5 and 6 address them.
Chapter 7 focuses on the role that contact must have played in shaping

16

Introduction

the present linguistic landscape of Africa. It shows how successive waves of indigenous and nonindigenous colonization played a role in bringing populations and languages into contacts that produced language diversiﬁcation. The focus here is on Bantu migrations into Pygmy and Khoisan territories in Southern Africa, on the Arab colonization of North Africa, and on the European trade contacts and subsequent domination of Africa especially since the seventeenth century.
The notion of organism is certainly inconsistent with the reality of idiolects and the fact that these vary among themselves, often minimally and perhaps insigniﬁcantly, but sometimes quite signiﬁcantly. In this connection, it is also useful to remember that language and linguistic communities are typically discontinuous, more like metapopulations in ecology, which, according to Hanski (1996), consist of “habitat patches” connected by “dispersing individuals.” These observations underscore the signiﬁcance of analogizing a language with a species. I submit that a language is a Lamarckian species, whose genetic makeup can change several times in its lifetime. It is also a parasitic species, whose life and vitality depend on (the acts and dispositions of) its hosts, i.e., its speakers, on the society they form, and on the culture in which they live.
A language is a species which happens to share with a parasitic species quite a number of the characteristics discussed in chapter 6, but also diﬀers from it in several ways. For instance, within a population, linguistic features (roughly analogized with genes) are transmitted not only vertically (from older to younger speakers) and horizontally (among peers) but also bidirectionally: children do in turn inﬂuence their parents’ linguistic behaviors, in some cases more so than their parents inﬂuence theirs. Moreover, change in the linguistic species can be replacive, substituting one peculiarity for another, for example, the vocalic chain shifts in northern American cities discussed in Labov (1994). But it can also be additive (e.g., the addition of the ﬂap /D/ to the inventory of English alveolar stops in American English, as in the pronunciation of matter) and/or subtractive (e.g., loss of the interdental fricatives /θ, δ/, as in the words thought and this respectively, in some English dialects). Equally interesting about the linguistic species is the fact that even within idiolects (its individual members) competing features often coexist, a state of aﬀairs that gives the speaker a choice (free or conditioned) in using them.
Another important diﬀerence is the intervention of will in linguistic behavior, such as conscious decisions to speak like, or diﬀerently from, some other speciﬁc speakers, for reasons of identity. Natural selection in the biological species is independent of will, deﬁnitely out of the control of individual members of a species, especially at the level of genes, even in human communities where mating patterns are often controlled by rigid social conventions. In language evolution, the interplay of conscious and

1.4 Thinking of a language as a species

17

unconscious choices in speech acts complicates the scenario of the general impact on a communal language of selections that individual speakers make.
However, such diﬀerences between the linguistic and parasitic species need not discourage the population genetics approach adopted in this book. In the ﬁrst place, there are various kinds of biological species, and variation among them has not prevented the development of evolutionary theories, which remain sensitive to this fact. What we need is a common approach to similar structural and evolutionary patterns in both the biological and the linguistic species, while resorting to species-speciﬁc accounts of their respective peculiarities. As shown in chapter 6, there are indeed noteworthy similarities between the linguistic and the parasitic species which justify a population genetics approach to language evolution. For instance, the speed of language change is similar to that of evolution in the parasitic species, where generation is not an important factor, unlike in the animal species. Such diﬀerences in speed of change are correlated in part with diﬀerences in modes of feature/gene transmission and with the nature of the species.
The language-as-species trope also makes more obvious the fact that the idiolects that make up a language are similar on the Wittgensteinian family resemblance model. Speakers sometimes claim to speak the same language by invoking a common linguistic ancestor but not because they necessarily understand one another. Such a notion of a species is among the alternatives available in biology (O’Hara 1994). The often-invoked argument of mutual intelligibility really amounts to the potential that speakers of a language have to communicate with each other, just like members of a biological species have the potential to interbreed. Overall, in both biology and linguistics, the life of a species is conceived of as a function of the lives of its constituent members. A species is changed by the eﬀects that the environment (one of the relevant meanings of ecology, see section 1.5) exerts directly on individual members, rather than on the species itself. As suggested in section 1.1, a language is an abstraction which linguists should not overly reify.
From an evolutionary standpoint, an important question about both the linguistic and the biological species follows from the above conclusion: how do selections made at the level of individuals sometimes wind up as selections at the level of the species, while numerous other selections are of no particular consequence to the species? When do linguistic choices made by individual speakers translate into changes in the communal language? When ecology is adequately factored in, these questions boil down to the problem of multiple articulation of selection in a population, with diﬀerent selections applying concurrently at diﬀerent levels within the population. On the one hand, there are selections made by individual speakers which

18

Introduction

assign each idiolect what in biological terms would be identiﬁed as its genotype. Each idiolect has its idiosyncrasies, despite its overwhelming similarities with others in the same communal language. On the other hand, the community at large makes its own selections through the fact that the innovations or idiosyncrasies of some speakers, for instance the vocalization of /r/ in the word ﬂoor [ﬂɔə], are copied by other speakers while others are not, for instance the alternative rhotic pronunciation [ﬂɔr]. (Interestingly, those features that spread within a community need not originate in the same speakers.) The community-level selection is what produces macroevolutionary developments identiﬁed as changes in a communal language. However, so far the principles regulating both individual and group selections are not fully understood. My invocation of an ecology-sensitive model of markedness in chapter 2 to account for feature selection hardly deals with this challenge for future research.
Clearly, individual speakers are critical unwitting agents of language evolution. This occurs through the day-to-day accommodations which speakers make to one another, the adjustments they make to new communicative needs, and the simple condition of imperfect replication during language transmission. Accommodation emphasizes the signiﬁcance of idiolect contact within a population of speakers and the central role it plays in language change. While interacting with one other, speakers contribute features to a pool from which they make their selections that can aﬀect the evolutionary trajectory of a language. The features they contribute can be from the same language or dialect, or from diﬀerent ones. The selections they make are not necessarily constrained by the origins of the features, and each idiolect reorganizes its selections on the model of blending inheritance in biology. However, we must remember that, unlike in the animal species, this blending is polyploidic, subject to threshold eﬀects. What becomes obvious here is that the extent to which a language is restructured is in part determined by structural diﬀerences between it and the other systems with which it has been in contact (chapter 2). This is obvious at the interidiolectal level. I submit that contact as an ecological factor is everywhere in our day-to-day interactions. It nurtures the invisible hand that executes change.
There is another fold of competition in a linguistic community, that among alternative means of communication. In many places around the world, speakers use more than one language and/or dialect. Usually they alternate between these codes. However, in some cases they are forced by their circumstances to use only, or mostly, one of the dialects or languages, developing passive, or no, knowledge of the other alternatives. The facts discussed in chapters 2, 3, and 6 show that the choices of language varieties and/or of the features that wind up being associated with such varieties are not necessarily exclusive.
Situations where speakers have a choice between two or more languages/

dialects also lead to mixing. Much of the literature that has proposed all sorts of names for diﬀerent kinds of mixed systems (e.g., Thomason and Kaufman 1988; Arends et al. 1995) only shows that there are diverse ways and degrees of mixing linguistic systems. What is relevant to this book is that these diﬀerent kinds and/or degrees of mixedness illustrate ways in which a language may speciate in ecologies where it has been in contact with at least one other language. A language or dialect may borrow heavily in vocabulary, another heavily in grammar, and another in both. Mixing of grammars can even take place in diﬀerent ways, for instance, in the verb phrase but not in the noun phrase, or vice versa, as in Michif (Papen 1987; Bakker 1997) and Copper Island Aleut (Golovko and Vakhtin 1990). What the literature reveals is simply that there are probably no constraints other than those imposed by Universal Grammar on how materials from heterogeneous sources can be combined to form a new language variety. Schuchardt (1884) and Hjelmslev (1938) were right in arguing that every language is mixed to some extent.13
There is no clear measure of what extent of mixedness would make a language variety genetically not derivable from another. Political considerations notwithstanding, we cannot continue to privilege the prevalent origin of the vocabulary in some cases (the practice for accepted genetic connections in genetic linguistics) and ignore it in others (the case of creoles), nor to consider the correct grammatical contributions for some languages but the wrong ones for others. This embarrassing practice is obvious when one compares traditional genetic linguistics with studies of the development of creoles. We may as well start considering alternative ways of grouping and representing languages genetically that accommodate either multiple parentage or, simply, the inﬂuence of other languages on the evolution of a particular language (chapter 5).
From the point of view of speciation in genetic linguistics, there seems to be no reason for not considering creoles as oﬀspring of their lexiﬁers (chapters 4 and 5), regardless of whether they are considered as separate languages or dialects of their lexiﬁers.14 The structural diﬀerences between creoles and their noncreole kin which have misled linguists into attributing diﬀerent genetic statuses to them do not amount to diﬀerences in the evolutionary processes that produced them. Yet the evolutionary processes are what account and should matter for language speciation. Structural diﬀerences between creoles and their noncreole kin amount to diﬀerences in outputs as determined by variation in the ecological conditions aﬀecting the same language restructuring equation.
Such ecological variation, which includes diﬀerences in the kinds of systems which competed with each other during the restructuring of the lexiﬁer, also accounts for structural variation from one creole to another. Like the growing evidence on code-mixing, creoles indicate that there is more

20

Introduction

osmosis in language than has usually been assumed in linguistics. In a lot of ethnographic settings, as made evident by the literature on code-mixing and nonlinguistic gestures,15 speakers are more concerned with communicating, by any of the means available to them, than with language or dialect boundaries. Code-mixing or, more generally, language or dialect contact, is probably more central to normal language evolution than has been recognized in historical and genetic linguistics.
The competition-and-selection model also makes it possible for us to discuss fruitfully another aspect of language evolution, viz., whether or not a language thrives or is endangered by the competition of other languages in a particular population of speakers. In chapter 6, I survey the fates of some languages around the world, covering diﬀerent periods over the past two millennia and highlighting various ecological factors that bear on their vitality. I show that the typically unconscious selections made at the ethnographic level for, or against, some languages are concurrent with choices that individual speakers made of linguistic features which contributed to language speciation. These selections did not consistently favor one and the same language. For instance, the development of the Romance languages reﬂects two facts: (i) Vulgar Latin prevailed over the Celtic languages of today’s Romance countries, and (ii) in turn it was aﬀected by Celtic substrate features and by later contacts with Frankish (a Germanic language variety) in France and with Arabic in Iberia (Posner 1996). Indeed Vulgar Latin won a pyrrhic victory, prevailing over its competitors but quite modiﬁed by them in the process.
An understanding of this evolution helps us realize that little of what is happening today to the Romance languages and to the languages with which they have been in contact outside Europe is unique to these recent situations. For instance, the fact that there are now restructured New World varieties of French, Portuguese, and Spanish which have vernacularized at the expense of Native American languages is reminiscent of the contact of Vulgar Latin and the Celtic languages in Europe. One can say that history is repeating itself.
Chapter 7 provides similar information about language speciation in Africa. It articulates further the diﬀerence between settlement and exploitation colonization in order to explain the diﬀering evolutionary trajectories of Arabic and European colonial languages on this continent. The spread of Arabs in North Africa was on a settlement model similar to that of the European colonization of the New World, with the language of the settlers prevailing at the expense of those more indigenous to the area and yet speciating into new varieties. This is also similar to the linguistic consequences of Bantu dispersal south of the Sahara.
On the other hand, with the exception of the Afrikaners, the Europeans colonized Africa on the exploitation model. They imposed social segrega-

tion from the beginning and limited the exposure of the colonial languages to small fractions of the indigenous populations, relying mostly on the school system for their spread. The result has been the emergence of indigenized varieties which function as lingua francas only for very speciﬁc functions and are not endangering the indigenous African languages in any way.
A signiﬁcant linguistic impact of the European colonization is the development of lingua francas such as Kituba, Lingala, Sango, and Shaba Swahili from labor migrations. They have made more compelling the role of contact in language speciation. We need not worry about whether they should be called pidgins, creoles, or otherwise. We should focus on the fact that population movement and language contact have typically underlain language evolution in Africa and elsewhere. Such language varieties and other, noncreole ones discussed in this book cast doubt on the position that the role of contact is negligible in “normal” language evolution.
It is hard to resist noting similarities between the developments of the creole and noncreole varieties, especially in the New World (chapter 6). In both cases, a European language has been appropriated as a vernacular (in part) by groups which spoke diﬀerent languages and must have inﬂuenced its restructuring. Also, in both cases the contact and ensuing change took place in an exogenous colony, nonindigenous to both those whose language has prevailed over others and to those who shifted to it. The diﬀerences between the evolutions that produced the creole and noncreole vernaculars turn out to be especially ecological in the sense explained below. Much of the outcome was determined by the speciﬁc structural features of the European varieties to which the non-native speakers were exposed, by the patterns of interaction under which the latter shifted from their own vernaculars to the European languages, by the structural features of the nonEuropean languages, and so on. We linguists must ask ourselves whether, by arguing without convincing demonstration that creoles have developed by their own unique processes, we have not contributed to disfranchising these new vernaculars.

1.5 What is the ecology of language?
Gould (1993) identiﬁes ecology as the decisive factor that rolls the dice over the competition both among individuals within a species and among species that share the same habitat. It favors some individuals and/or species, giving them selective advantage over others. Otherwise, there are no individuals or species which out of context are more ﬁt than others. This notion of ecology supports the layperson’s identiﬁcation of it with the environment. This is also the interpretation in linguistics since Voegelin, Voegelin, and Schutz (1967), in the few cases where “ecology” has been invoked to account for language evolution.

22

Introduction

However, in biology ecology is also internal to a species (Brown 1995). In addition to the environment, it includes a number of factors within a species. In the case of language evolution, such factors include cross-dialectal and interidiolectal variation (insofar as they are considered parts of coexistent systems in a communal language), as well as the way structural principles coexist within a language. All aspects of variation accessible to speakers bear on choices that they make consciously or unconsciously in their speech acts, the part of the “invisible hand” that inﬂuences the evolutionary trajectory of a language. For instance, in AAVE, one has the option of predicating adjective and preposition phrases with or without a copula in the present tense, such that Larry tall/with Mary is as well formed as Larry’s tall/with Mary. Such copula-less predicative constructions are nurtured ecologically by the existence of other constructions such as the following in which the copula seldom occurs: Tracy done gone and Tracy bin done gone. Evolution toward predicative constructions in which the copula is required in the present tense would have to involve a restructuring of these aspects of AAVE’s tense–aspect system too. That it is required in other American English dialects is not enough of an ecological factor to trigger a convergence of AAVE with standard or White middle-class English.
Linguistic features in a system also constitute part of the ecology for one another. Removal, insertion, or modiﬁcation (of the role) of a variant aﬀects the distribution of other variants in a subsystem, thus yielding a diﬀerent kind of system overall. For instance, the addition of the ﬂap [D] in the American English phonological system, in words such as latter and ladder (pronounced the same), has contributed to distinguishing this variety from others, as it has reduced the overall phonetic distribution of the alveolar stops [t, d] in its lexicon. Even features that are not variants form part of the ecology for each other. Thus, in some English dialects, the loss of the interdental fricatives /θ, δ/, as in think and this, has also aﬀected the distribution of alveolar stops /t, d/, with the latter pair gaining a wider distribution than in other dialects. In this case, one depends more heavily on discourse context to distinguish words such as tie and thigh, or den and then, when they are produced indiscriminately as tie and den but not as thigh and then. In some other cases, it is the labiodental fricatives /f, v/ which occur where the interdental fricatives would be expected, with the words Ruth and roof pronounced alike as roof.
At the crossdialectal and interidiolectal levels, the mutual accommodations invoked in sections 1.3 and 1.4, which may cause changes within the system, are often the result of responses to species-internal ecological relations. Thus not only does the aﬀected dialect or idiolect lose the interdental fricatives /θ, δ/ but it also gains wider distributions of the alveolar stops /t, d/ and/or labio-dental fricatives /f, v/ in its lexicon. In the case of the above examples, attempts to sound like, or to remain diﬀerent from, other speakers

inﬂuence some individuals’ speech characteristics and act as an external ecological factor, while the coexistence of structural principles acts as an internal one.
So, the fact that the lexiﬁer of a creole, or any language undergoing change, was heterogeneous before the change is an important ecological factor that bears on its restructuring, which often results in the reallocation of expressive functions among units already in the system. For instance, on the plantations where English or French creoles developed, their lexiﬁers were typically incipient koinés from diverse dialects imported from the European metropole and from second-language varieties spoken by European indentured servants from other countries. Those who developed the relevant creoles were often exposed to more than one way of pronouncing the words this and think in colonial English or the word trois “three” in colonial French.
Thus, part of internal ecology in the evolution of a language lies in the actual structure of the language itself just before its restructuring: what units and principles were in place and how interrelated were some of them? Knowledge of the state of the language at that time would preempt unjustiﬁed explanations. For instance, knowing that pronunciations such as /gwot/ for goat and /pyε/ for pear were attested as alternatives to the more common ones in the colonial English to which non-Europeans were exposed – just as were lexical uses such as learn for “teach” and thief for “steal”, and constructions such as he was a-huntin – would make it unnecessary to seek exclusive non-English explanations in order to account for their presence in Atlantic creoles.
These examples are not intended to dispute the role of substrate languages (the other external ecological factor relative to the lexiﬁer) in the selection of these peculiarities into Atlantic English creoles. As explained in Mufwene (1993b), congruence of features of (some) substrate languages with variants available in the lexiﬁer often favored the selection of some features that could have been omitted, such as some of the above examples which did not ﬁnd their way into noncreole varieties of North American English. Assuming that the local varieties of English which lexiﬁed the diﬀerent pidgins/creoles were very similar (even if internally variable) in both the Atlantic and the Paciﬁc areas, cross-area diﬀerences between these new varieties support the ecological role of the substrate languages in the selection of particular features, including those originating directly in the substrate languages (for instance the / distinction in Tok Pisin).
However, what must also be realized is that in most cases diﬀerent selections of features could have been made if in the ﬁrst place the options now attested in a pidgin or creole had not been available in the lexiﬁer. As the rest of the creoles’ systems show, speakers of the substrate languages were deﬁnitely not determined to continue using principles of their ancestral

24

Introduction

languages by simply associating them with (the phonological forms of) lexical items from the lexiﬁer (cf. Lefebvre 1998; Lumsden 1999). As much incontrovertible substrate inﬂuence as there is in Oceanic pidgins, these new varieties are not nearly as complex morphosyntactically as their substrate languages (Sankoﬀ and Brown 1976, Sankoﬀ 1984, 1993; Keesing 1988).
During the development of creoles, as of other new language varieties, the structural systems of the lexiﬁers were naturally undone and redone a few times, being gradually modiﬁed in the transmission process, consistent with Lass’s (1997) principle of imperfect replication and with Meillet’s (1929) and Hagège’s (1993) observation that language transmission involves both inheritance and recreation. One can also argue that, by the principle of least effort, those who made the new varieties used materials already available in the lexiﬁer (the inheritance part) and sometimes modiﬁed them unwittingly to produce (somewhat) diﬀerent systems (the recreation part). The original system can hardly remain intact and the dynamics of the coexistent variants have a lot to do with the evolutionary path that a language takes. Overall, internally motivated change would be hard to explain, from the point of view of causation, without the kind of approach presented here. The agency of change lies deﬁnitely within the behavior of individual speakers, and causation partly in the mutual accommodations they make to each other while they are more intent on communicating eﬀectively than on preserving idiolectal, dialectal, or language boundaries.
The following questions are relevant to understanding ecology: Were the evolutionary processes that produced the relevant new varieties random? What role did the combination of internal and external ecologies play in the development of all the new varieties of European languages since the seventeenth century? What does the development of creoles tell us about language evolution in general? The essays assembled in this book are intended to help us answer them or at least reformulate them more adequately. In some cases, they do no more than open a debate on issues that are much more complex than we may have imagined. In some others, they simply show that it may have been premature to declare or assume the case closed. The question of whether creoles are structurally and/or evolutionarily diﬀerent from noncreole languages is quite open, just as is that of whether they are dialects of their lexiﬁers or separate languages (by any structural linguistic criteria?). How much has really been explained about language speciation? Can the role of contact be overlooked in the latter case? How are traditional questions of language evolution related to those of the “life of a language,” which have to do with whether a particular language thrives or is doomed to extinction? How do competition and selection work concomitantly with language transmission? These are all questions that I hope this book makes more interesting for linguists to address.

2 The Founder Principle in the development of creoles1
The original title of this chapter was “the Founder Principle in creole genesis.” I have modiﬁed it here because, as pointed out in the Preface, the established phrase creole genesis is misleading. Although there has been a great deal of interest in the origins of creoles’ structural features, much of the research in genetic creolistics has been on the development of these vernaculars, which was a protracted process. Such scholarship has also focused on their identiﬁcation as separate varieties, hence on the speciation of their lexiﬁers into diverse new varieties. The latter interest has justiﬁed discussing creoles’ “life cycles” too, for instance whether or not they have “decreolized,” i.e., lost their basilectal features and become structurally closer to their acrolects. These concerns all remain in the present chapter, and I ﬁnd the term development of creoles truer to the subject matter.
This essay is not the ﬁrst in which I have elaborated my population genetics approach. That distinction goes to “Creole genesis: a population genetics perspective,” presented at the meeting of the Society for Pidgin and Creole Linguistics, at the University of Amsterdam in 1993, but published only a couple of months before this one, in 1996 (cited here as Mufwene 1996b). However, in the present essay, I had an opportunity not only to articulate my hypotheses more explicitly but also to sketch out a long-term research agenda with several questions and issues that I would address in later essays. Some of these are included in this book, but others are yet to be written. I was lucky to be prompted by one of Diachronica’s referees to deﬁne “restructuring,” which I explained brieﬂy in chapter 1 and elucidate below.
Characterizing the process of restructuring led me to think, from an ecological perspective, more about a language as a complex adaptive system. It is undone and redone several times during its transmission from one group of speakers to the next and thus keeps changing in various ways. For instance, it can lose features and/or acquire new ones, or it can exhibit diﬀerent statistical distributions of the same features within its system, owing perhaps to changes in the relative weights of factors regulating the distribution of competing variants. Equally relevant is the fact that not all
25

26

The Founder Principle

its modules need be aﬀected (to the same extent) during the restructuring process. The morphology module may be restructured more extensively than the syntax or phonology subsystems, or vice versa, despite the interconnections between them. One module may be more inﬂuenced by the substrate languages than another.
As explained in chapter 1, it is through the spontaneous communicative acts of speakers that the restructuring is done. Otherwise, speakers typically do not plan to rearrange their language variety and give it “a new look.” I found it necessary then to note the role of communication networks as points from which changes spread. Since everything begins with individual speakers, the role of mutual accommodations in regular verbal intercourses could not be overlooked either. These phenomena are reminiscent of breeding conventions in population genetics and their role in the selection and transmission of genes within a population. It is on this model that the dynamics of language evolution are presented here. I return to this subject matter in chapter 6, where I articulate more explicitly similarities and diﬀerences between the biological and linguistic species and argue that there are compelling reasons for approaching language evolution on the population genetics model. I argue that this approach amounts to doing population genetics of language evolution, transcending simple borrowing of concepts from biology and addressing questions more speciﬁc to the linguistic species. To date, mentions of “creole genesis” in historical linguistics volumes such as McMahon (1994) and Hock and Joseph (1996) are ambivalent, partly perpetuating the view that these vernaculars have not developed by the same evolutionary processes that have aﬀected the lives of noncreole languages. I argue below for just the opposite interpretation.
The notion of accommodation is related to variation within a population, and this led me to think of the competition-and-selection condition of the ecologies in which creoles developed, and more generally, in which any language evolves. I had to articulate the manifold aspects of the competition, both ethnographically and structurally (an aspect of the subject matter to which I return in chapter 6). Then I still had to ask what principles constrain the selection processes that resolved the competition. Are all competitions usually resolved, and is such a resolution necessary in the ﬁrst place? All in all, this chapter enabled me to show that the subject matter of the development of creoles is a much more complex process than the literature has suggested, especially when it is well anchored in the socioeconomic history that explains the relevant population movements and language contacts, as well as their consequences.
Compared to the original essay, this chapter has been adjusted not to overlap with chapter 1, in which the general background to its arguments are articulated. The notion of “Founder Principle” used here is similar to

2.1 Introduction

27

Zelinsky’s (1992) (1973) “Doctrine of First Eﬀective Settlement,” according to which

Whenever an empty territory undergoes settlement, or an earlier population is dislodged by invaders, the speciﬁc characteristics of the ﬁrst group able to eﬀect a viable, self-perpetuating society are of crucial signiﬁcance to the later social and cultural geography of the area, no matter how tiny the initial band of settlers may have been . . . in terms of lasting impact, the activities of a few hundred, or even a few score, initial colonizers can mean much more for the cultural geography of a place than the contributions of tens of thousands of new immigrants generations later. (1992 (1973):13–14)

However, I have been inspired almost exclusively by biology rather than cultural geography. The terms in usage there for the same idea are Founder Principle and Founder Eﬀect. I am sticking to this model and will not refer to Zelinsky simply because I became aware of his work after the revised substance of this book was already in place. I will explore in later work ways in which it can improve my approach to language evolution.

2.1 Introduction
Genetic creolistics has focused more on the coexistence of languages in a population than on the actual contacts that take place in the minds of speakers. Contact at the communal level provides the conditions for the actual contact of linguistic systems in the minds of speakers, the loci of phenomena that have interested linguists. My primary concern in this chapter is creoles of the New World and the Indian Ocean, which the literature has made our heuristic prototypes. However, nothing precludes the main thesis of this chapter (stated two paragraphs below!) from applying to other contact-induced language varieties, especially those which have been lexiﬁed by non-European languages and to which the terms pidgin or creole have been extended (e.g., Kituba, Lingala, and Sango). Of ﬁrst importance in all such cases is the contact origin of the varieties. The speciﬁc socioeconomic histories of their developments account for regional diversity in the outcomes of the restructuring of the same lexiﬁer (Le Page and TabouretKeller 1985). They are part of the ecology of the restructuring process.
The term restructuring is used in this book in the sense of “system reorganization,” comparable to “genetic recombination” in biology. However, what is reorganized in a language amounts to, for instance, phonological and morphological units and principles that regulate how they are used individually and in combinations with each other (chapter 1). My basic position is that during the development of an I-language at least part of the system associated with a communal language is undone and redone in ways that do not necessarily replicate the original or the target. Cumulatively

28

The Founder Principle

such recreations may amount to a new communal system that is diﬀerent from the target. The divergence which has resulted from such restructuring is characterized as a change.
A creole is a restructured variety of its lexiﬁer. The latter was primarily the colonial variety which was spoken by the European colonists and was itself developing from the contact of diverse metropolitan dialects. It has often been identiﬁed as a koiné (e.g., Chaudenson 1992, Corne 1999).2 As explained in chapter 1, this is in itself a restructured variety, which has also developed by competition and selection of features from the diﬀerent dialects of the same language. This view deﬁnitely complicates things, but usefully, as it helps determine the particular role played by non-Europeans in actuating the changes that produced creoles. More and more detailed studies of nonstandard varieties of European languages have revealed features that are (partially) related to those of creoles. Note, for instance, uses of done as a  marker (Christian, Wolfram, and Bube 1988; Tagliamonte 1996), of does + Verb ([dəz] in Gullah) and be + V-ing or nonverbal Predicate as  markers (Clarke 1997a), of durative a (“apreﬁxing,” Wolfram 1980), and of a null copula (Giner and Montgomery 1999; Martin and Tagliamonte 1999). Even the preverbal progressive marker [də] in Gullah ([dε] in other English creoles) is matched by basically the same construction in Newfoundland vernacular English (personal observation, August 1999).
Restructuring partly consisted in modifying functions of the grammatical features selected from a language into an emergent variety. For instance, the English preposition for participated in the restructuring that produced several English creoles. In addition to being selected as a purposive and causal preposition, it was also extended to function as a modal predicate and as a complementizer (Mufwene 1989a, 1996a). This extension was facilitated by the fact that a nonverbal item can be used predicatively without a copula in these new vernaculars. Thus, the same kinds of exaptations which are associated with grammaticization were applied in some syntactic environments to extend its basic purposive prepositional function to a modal one without necessarily changing its syntactic properties.
The reorganization also consists in recombining in a new system features which formerly did not belong in the same one, as may be determined by the diverse origins (dialect and language-wise) of several features of any creole. Such is the case with the collapsing of the   function – which is commonly expressed in most SubSaharan African languages – with the typical  function of nonstandard English dem in the same system.3
The term Founder Principle (Harrison et al. 1988), is used here, along with founder population, to explain how structural features of creoles have

2.1 Introduction

29

been predetermined to a large extent (though not exclusively!) by characteristics of the vernaculars spoken by the populations that founded the colonies in which they developed.4 European colonies typically started with large proportions of indentured servants and other low-class employees of colonial companies (see e.g., Beckles 1990; Kulikoﬀ 1991a, 1991b; Menard 1991), and thus with speakers of nonstandard varieties of the creoles’ lexiﬁers. This proletarian background of the colonies generally explains the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century nonstandard origins of several features of creoles. Further, some features which might be considered disadvantageous in the metropolitan varieties of the lexiﬁers – because they were rare, not dominant, and/or used by a minority – may well have become advantageous in the speech of the colonies’ founder populations. The founder population produced what Nettle (1999:15) identiﬁes as “ampliﬁers of variation,” with variation to be interpreted as “diversity,” having to do with “diﬀerentiation” (p. 30). This is accomplished at least by accumulating new combinations of variants or by weighting them diﬀerently (p. 17), because of biases toward some variants or speakers (p. 25).
Examples include the  construction with après + Inﬁnitive and the  construction with pour + Inﬁnitive in nonstandard French, or locative–progressive constructions such as be up(on) V-ing in earlier varieties of English (now also attested as be a-V-in in some nonstandard varieties). For any subset of the reasons discussed below, these features have been selected into the systems of some creoles, although not necessarily with the same systemic distribution as in the lexiﬁer.5 Through transmission from one generation of speakers to another, they have become deeply entrenched, as predicted by Wimsatt’s (1999, 2000) principle of “generative entrenchment.” That is, barring some stochastic events in the evolution of a language variety, the oldest features have a greater chance of prevailing over some newer alternatives simply because they have acquired more and more carriers, hence more transmitters, with each additional generation of speakers.
The typical population-genetics kinds of explanations for the dominance of such would-be disadvantageous features in a (colony’s) population are: (i) such features may have been reintroduced by mutation; (ii) they may have been favored by new ecological conditions in the colony; or (iii) the colony may have received signiﬁcant proportions of carriers of the features, a situation which maximized the chances for their successful reproduction. I argue below that in the development of creoles the second and third reasons account largely for the restructuring of the lexiﬁer. True mutations are rare, though there are plenty of adaptations. The developments of creoles are instances of natural adaptations of languages qua species to changing ecological conditions. In every colony, selection of the lexiﬁer for

30

The Founder Principle

large-scale communication in an ethnographic ecology that diﬀered from the metropolitan setting called for adaptations that resulted in a new language variety.
The notion of “ecology” will be discussed in detail in chapter 6. Worth recalling here is the distinction stated in chapter 1 between species-internal and species-external ecologies. The former pertains to the coexistence of features in a language variety, whereas the latter subsumes, in our case, the contact of a linguistic system with another and the general ethnographic context in which it is used. The allocation of some factors to internal or external ecology also depends on the focus of the analyst. For instance, while discussing a language such as English brought to North America from the British Isles, dialectal variation can be considered internal ecology. On the other hand, the same variation can be considered external ecology if the analyst focused only on the London dialect coming in contact with British Southwestern English in, say, Virginia. The main idea is that when there are alternative strategies for the same or similar grammatical functions, each of the variants becomes part of the ecology for the others and each one of them can be aﬀected by what happens to the others. Simple systemic relations among diﬀerent aspects of a system are also part of this internal ecology. For instance, as shown above, whether or not the preposition for can develop into a purposive modal depends, from an internalecology perspective, on whether or not a nonverbal predicate phrase must combine with a copula in the emergent variety.
Except where considerations are obviously diﬀerent, as between pragmatic and structural principles, there is no clearcut boundary between internal and external ecology. The notion of coordinate bilingualism in which linguistic systems are kept separate is a myth that is inconsistent with, for instance, the speed of second language acquisition compared to ﬁrst language acquisition. The contact of language varieties, hence of linguistic systems, in the mind of a speaker produces a set-theory union of features that is analogous to a gene pool in population genetics. Nettle (1999:5) identiﬁes it as a “linguistic pool,” which unfortunately does not rule out languages as part of the pool. A more adequate counterpart to the notion of “gene pool” is perhaps “feature pool,” although the concept of “feature” is not an ideal analog of “gene” either. However, as observed in chapter 1, there is no particular reason why every structural notion applicable to a biological species should also be applicable to a linguistic species, nor why the latter should be thought of in all respects like the former. I prefer the name “feature pool” to “linguistic pool” simply because the term “feature” refers more speciﬁcally to parts or components than the term linguistic.
The coexistence of linguistic systems in a set-theory union fashion

(perhaps complemented by a tagging system for speciﬁc languages) seems in fact to be the simplest explanation for interference. Regardless of their origins, the coexistent features compete with each other. When the tagging conventions that associate them with diﬀerent, yet overlapping, systems have failed, there is confusion, identiﬁed in the context of language contact as interference. That coexistence of features and its consequences is an important ecological factor that accounts for some of the evolutionary processes that produced creoles, ranging from the unrounding of French front rounded vowels in Haitian Creole to the extensive use of serial verb constructions based partly on models such as aller prendre “go get” in French itself.
Because several geographically distant metropolitan varieties of the lexiﬁer came into contact with each other in the colonies (Le Page 1960; Le Page and Tabouret-Keller 1985), many features that distinguished them from each other were likewise engaged in the competition, once they formed a larger pool in the locus of contact (in the speakers’ minds). The selection of those which became parts of colonial vernaculars often depended on congruence with features of some substrate languages (see below). An ecological approach helps us determine which factors in individual contact arenas favored the selection of advantageous features into creoles’ systems. My ecology-sensitive model of markedness (Mufwene 1989c, 1991a) was designed to answer some of the questions regarding feature selection.
As the ecological conditions changed over time (section 2.2), new features may have prevailed over some older ones, which in turn became disadvantageous. For instance, the habitual marker [dəz] in Gullah and its counterpart [dɔz] in Guyanese Creole may have developed under labor recruitment conditions that were diﬀerent from those of the founder populations which had come earlier from Barbados. The later recruits from the British Isles would have created conditions more favorable to the prevalence of the habitual or consuetudinal does ([dəz]), then attested in the Englishes of Ireland and Southwest England (Clarke 1997a:284f). The fact that in other English varieties the periphrastic does has an –  function must have been an ecological factor favoring the selection of [dəz]/[dɔz] in Gullah and Guyanese Creole, which cannot have developed before the eighteenth century. In the ﬁrst case the conditions for basilectalization did not obtain till after 1700, in the second the colony was not founded until 1740 (see below). The Barbadian basilectal creole texts studied by Fields (1995) and Rickford and Handler (1994) reveal no attestations of such a  construction, which rules out the role of importation of the feature from Barbados by the original, founder populations of the South Carolina and Guyana colonies. Jamaican Creole, which

32

The Founder Principle

must have developed earlier and also has some historical connection with Barbadian (Le Page and Tabouret-Keller 1985), has no such  construction either. Neither does Saramaccan, which also has older genetic ties with Barbadian colonial English speech. We are left with the conjecture that the feature must have been brought straight from Southwestern England and Ireland, where consuetudinal does [dəz] was already established by 1700 (Clarke 1997a:284).6
Some new features may also have prevailed without eliminating any previous ones, with alternatives coexisting “happily” in the developing creole’s system, providing stable variation. For instance, in Belizean Creole, the later  construction with was (Escure 1984) has not displaced the original one with [mε], the counterpart of bin/ben in other Caribbean English creoles. In such historical scenarios marked by continuous population contacts (Le Page and Tabouret-Keller 1985; Winford 1998), how an emergent vernacular is aﬀected by new contacts depends in part on the makeup of the current system and in part on the new alternatives brought over by the new populations. For instance, did the new populations bring with them systems that are diﬀerent from, or largely similar to, those of the local or target vernaculars? Factors such as regularity, semantic transparency, and perceptual salience also continue to bear, sometimes in conﬂicting ways, on the selection of features into a creole’s system as it continues to evolve under changing contact conditions. Ethnographic factors such as the demographic proportion of the newcomers relative to the local populations, their attitudes toward each other, and their social status also bear on how the systems in contact emerge from the competition.
As noted in chapter 1, speakers are the agents of the selection processes invoked here. It is through their communicative acts that selective advantage was conferred on some structural features over competing alternatives. Their role as agents was made possible by the fact that their minds were the arenas of the feature competition discussed here. The plantations count as settings of contact at a second level, at which features not uniformly selected by individual speakers competed with each other for prevalence in the communal system. Factors such as frequency, which determine markedness values and inﬂuence feature selection, may prevail at this level, unlike structural factors. This distinction is important because, as in biology, the features that gain selective advantage at the level of individuals (“individual selection”) need not prevail at the level of populations (“group selection”). It also allows variation within a population, as is typical of creole vernaculars.
Consequently, language contact is a more complex situation than has been assumed in the literature on the development of creoles. Any communal language exists because speakers using systems that are not necessarily identical interact with one another. In the process they accommodate each

2.2 Development of creoles

33

other in their speech habits. While still maintaining some idiosyncrasies of their own, they achieve what Le Page and Tabouret-Keller (1985) call “focusing.” Creoles have developed both from individual speakers’ attempts to speak the lexiﬁer and through their mutual accommodations in the contact settings.7 For convenience, we simplify this more complex picture of contact by focusing on the communal language level. In reality, however, the primary actions identiﬁed here through the notions of competition and selection take place in the minds of individual speakers. Recognizing the reality described in this section enables us to account for variation within the community.

2.2 The development of creoles: what the histories of individual colonies suggest
The purpose of this section is to dispel several unwarranted assumptions in studies of the development of creoles. I propose some alternatives that are critical to understanding how the Founder Principle works. I begin by showing why we need not subscribe to any of the dominant hypotheses to explain how creoles and other contact-induced vernaculars developed.

2.2.1 A brief survey of approaches to the development of creoles
Since about 1980, discussions of the origins of grammatical features of creoles have been polarized between substratist and universalist hypotheses, as well captured by the title of Muysken and Smith (1986): Universals versus substrata in creole genesis. According to substratists (e.g., Alleyne 1980, 1996; Lefebvre 1986, 1998; Holm 1988), these creoles owe most of their structural features to the inﬂuence of the languages previously spoken by the African slaves, who were the overwhelming majority on New World plantations, at the critical formative stages of these new vernaculars. According to some universalists, these new vernaculars owe their features to the language bioprogram, a blueprint for language, which putatively is most active in children. The latter innovated most of their grammatical structures, which helped remedy the deﬁciencies of their parents’ pidgins while they acquired them as their mother tongues (Bickerton 1981, 1984, 1992, 1999). According to some other universalists, creoles owe their grammatical peculiarities to universal principles of (second) language acquisition, with adults being the (primary) agents of vernacularization (Thomason 1980, Sankoﬀ 1984).8
Although quite strong from the 1920s to the 1960s, the view that the colonial varieties of the European languages played a critical role in determining not only the vocabularies of creole vernaculars but also their grammars

34

The Founder Principle

has generally been downplayed since the 1970s. The legacy of Krapp (1924), Kurath (1928), Johnson (1930), Faine (1937), Hall (1966), and Valkhoﬀ (1966), among others, has been barely noticeable in the context of Atlantic creoles. Exceptions include D’Eloia (1973) and Schneider (1989) regarding African-American vernacular English (AAVE), and Chaudenson (1979, 1989, 1992) in the case of mostly Indian Ocean French creoles.
Overall, superstratists claim that creoles have typically extrapolated, through normal adaptive processes, structural alternatives that were already present in metropolitan and/or colonial varieties of the lexiﬁers. The new vernaculars did not innovate much in the sense of ex nihilo or UGbased creations advocated by Bickerton (1984, 1992). Nor did they accept much substrate inﬂuence that did not have some model, however partial or statistically limited, in their lexiﬁers. However, Chaudenson (1989, 1992) and Corne (1999) recognize the role of substrate inﬂuence, without which creole vernaculars would be more similar to (ex-)colonial varieties of European languages spoken by descendants of Europeans, such as Québécois and Cajun French. Chaudenson takes creoles’ lexiﬁers to have been approximations by slaves of colonial European speech of the late homestead phase, i.e., varieties that were not signiﬁcantly restructured compared to European colonial speech. According to Chaudenson, during the homestead phase, identiﬁed as société d’habitation, all those born in the colonies spoke the same colonial varieties of European languages, regardless of race, because they all lived in the same integrated settings.9 (This is an important point against arguments that creoles developed due partly to a break in the transmission of the lexiﬁer. Transmitters of the lexiﬁer need not have been European.)
Since the mid-1980s I have contributed to the “complementary hypothesis.”10 I argue that the only inﬂuences in competition are structures of the lexiﬁer and of the substrate languages. The language bioprogram, which need not be understood to be operating exclusively in children, regulates the selection of structural features from among the options in competition among the language varieties in contact. It can incorporate my ecologysensitive markedness model, according to which the values of the competing alternatives are determined by diverse factors, such as regularity or invariance of form, frequency, generality, semantic transparency, and perceptual salience, among apparently a host of other factors that future research is likely to uncover.
Along with Le Page and Tabouret-Keller (1985) and Chaudenson (1992), I criticize a shortcoming common in most studies, viz., the comparison of creoles’ structural features with those of the standard varieties of their lexiﬁers rather than of their nonstandard varieties. The illusion that the Europeans with whom the non-Europeans interacted on the plantations

2.2 Development of creoles

35

spoke the standard varieties of their lexiﬁers is not consistent with sociohistorical information available about the beginnings of the colonies. Some seventeenth-century letters addressed to, for instance, the West Indian Company, the Virginia Company, the [Dutch] West India Company, or their other European counterparts reveal that their authors were typically low-ranking employees who had been sent on diﬃcult ground-breaking missions in the colonies. They corroborate studies of Ship English, such as Bailey and Ross (1988:196–7), who argue that “most of the sailors were illiterate, including many of the captains and masters.” According to this literature, the varieties spoken aboard the ships must have been more nonstandard than the ships’ logs indicate, especially as the written medium may have skewed the samples in the direction of the standard variety.
These observations are consistent with historical accounts according to which large proportions of the immigrant European populations consisted of defector soldiers and sailors, destitute farmers, indentured laborers, and sometimes convicts. That is, the vast majority of the (early) colonists came from the lower strata of European societies. As much of their correspondence indicates (e.g., Eliason 1956), they spoke nonstandard varieties, inherited by the vernaculars of rural and low-income Whites in such locations as the Piedmont, Appalachian and Ozark Mountains in the USA. The same may be said of French varieties spoken on the Caribbean islands of, e.g., St. Barths and St. Thomas.
It has often been argued against the non-relexiﬁcationist version of the substrate hypothesis (represented chieﬂy by Alleyne and Holm) that the Africans could not inﬂuence the structures of the emerging creoles because of their extensively diverse linguistic backgrounds. However, as noted above, the European lexiﬁers themselves were typically heterogeneous. Several of their diverse dialects were brought into contact with one another in the colonies. As shown in chapter 3 regarding North America, the varieties spoken today in such former colonies are also outcomes of restructuring under contact conditions, regardless of the extent of their system-reorganizations. Contact-induced restructuring explains why none of the extra-European dialects is an exact match of any metropolitan variety. As shown in chapter 1, koinéization – if such a name is necessary at all – is the same kind of restructuring that produced creoles by competition and selection, except regarding whether the varieties in contact were genetically and/or typologically related, and whether the languages in contact were all European. (The latter is a shameful tacit assumption of creolistics that is hardly ever stated.) Investigating the development of (ex-)colonial dialects of European languages ecologically should be informative about the nature of feature competition and the factors which regulated speciﬁc selections in their respective settings. In relation to creoles, factoring in the

36

The Founder Principle

relevant historical, socioeconomic information about the contact settings and speakers of these colonial varieties should also tell us a great deal about the origins of the typically nonstandard options which found their way into creoles’ structures, even if only in modiﬁed forms.

2.2.2 The koiné lexiﬁers of creoles
A factor that has often been overlooked regarding both the European and non-European elements in the new vernaculars is the demographic signiﬁcance of diverse ethnolinguistic groups and how it varied from one period to another during the development of these communities. This factor greatly complicates the language contact formula regarding when a particular language variety was likely or unlikely to inﬂuence the development of a new vernacular. I return to this in section 2.3.
Hancock (1969) and Dillard (1972, 1985), among others, emphasize the contribution of an antecedent maritime, or nautical, English jargon to the development of the new colonial varieties. Like Le Page (1960) and Le Page and Tabouret-Keller (1985), Dillard (1985, 1992) invokes the high proportion of nautical terms to support this position. On the other hand, Buccini (1995) argues that the making of colonial varieties of European languages may have started in Europe. He presents port cities such as Amsterdam and Utrecht as contact settings where speakers of diverse Dutch dialects met before they sailed for the colonies. New varieties putatively developed there, triggering “leveling” processes (reinterpreted in chapter 1 as restructuring) which would continue up to the time of the colonies. It is not yet clear what role such diachronic processes, which must have taken place in other metropolitan port cities too, played in the development of nautical varieties.
It is plausible that these then-emergent port-city koinés and nautical varieties inﬂuenced the vernaculars that developed in the colonies. It is from the port cities, where they stayed for a while, that immigrants left for the colonies; and they traveled by sea. It is just not clear whether the new metropolitan koinés had already normalized before the colonists emigrated, nor is it evident whether they were dominant among the varieties which were brought from Europe. What Buccini observes may simply boil down to this: precolonial population movements and contacts in Europe itself must have initiated language restructuring, and forms of these restructured varieties were brought over to the colonies, where the process would continue under new ecological conditions.
The above summarizes what is also suggested by the socioeconomic history of colonization, especially as described by Bailyn (1986) and Fischer (1989) in the case of the USA. They show how British emigrations to North America were basically extensions of population movements that

2.2 Development of creoles

37

were taking place in the British Isles, originally in the direction of industrial Southern English cities. These were settings of population and dialect contact, where much of the restructuring that would take place in the colonies began. This process is well evidenced by the changes undergone by English in the UK since the seventeenth century.
All the above observations show that there was independent ground for feature competition and selection among the European colonists themselves, as proved by, for instance, Québécois French and North American White English vernaculars. Regarding the development of creoles, the competition-and-selection situation was made more complex by the presence not only of Africans on plantations but also of other Europeans who did not speak the lexiﬁer natively. In the case of the Chesapeake, numerous non-English-speaking Europeans, especially Germans, counted among the early indentured servants (Kulikoﬀ 1991a, 1991b; Menard 1991). Based on Dyde (1993) and Beckles (1990), regarding St. Kitts and Barbados, respectively, one is led to speculate that the practice of recruiting labor from places other than the metropole of a colony was a common practice. Moreover, a closer examination of the linguistic histories of the diﬀerent European metropoles reveals that not all their citizens or subjects spoke natively the languages which lexiﬁed the diﬀerent creoles.
For instance, as pointed out in chapter 1, rural Ireland was just beginning to Anglicize when England engaged in the colonization of the Caribbean and North America. Chaudenson (1992) cites Father Labbat’s observation that many French citizens (identiﬁed in French as “les patoisants”) could be learning French from African slaves of the homestead phase in their Caribbean colonies. The observation suggests that indeed several indentured servants in French colonies were not (ﬂuent) speakers of French. Some of the varieties then identiﬁed by Francophone French as “patois” were probably Celtic languages, just like Breton. Kibbee’s (1999) “French language policy timeline” shows that in places such as the Midi and Brittany, French did not become a common vernacular until the twentieth century. Thus, in the colonies, much of the same kind of restructuring of the lexiﬁer that took place among the Africans was also taking place among European colonists. An important diﬀerence regarding the restructuring of the lexiﬁer among the Europeans and among non-Europeans is the following: after segregation was institutionalized, selective substrate inﬂuence must have applied along racial lines, except for common features that had been selected earlier and were deeply entrenched. That is, with the Africans then interacting more among themselves than with non-Africans, some linguistic habits were likely to develop among them that were not attested, nor signiﬁcant, among other speakers, and vice versa. The nature and extent of such inﬂuence are yet to be determined.

38

The Founder Principle

Taking into account the following observations on how the colonies developed from homestead to plantation societies, the position that creoles’ lexiﬁers were not metropolitan varieties is plausible. There must have been some already locally restructured varieties, and/or something in the process of development, spoken by the founder populations, including Europeans and non-Europeans, of the homestead phase (Chaudenson 1979, 1989, 1992; Le Page and Tabouret-Keller 1985:26).

2.2.3 Normal, uninterrupted language transmission and the development of creoles
Most genetic creolists have taken it for granted that New World and the Indian Ocean creoles developed “abruptly,” within a human generation, after an initial phase during which a pidgin was spoken by adult nonEuropeans. The position is also related to the stipulation since Polomé (1983), repeated by several other creolists, that there was a break in the transmission of the lexiﬁer.
We must set aside some incorrect assumptions, for instance, that the lexiﬁers of creoles were monolithic and standard varieties. Then we can realize that the socioeconomic histories of the territories where these vernaculars developed do not support the pidgin-to-creole evolutionary scenario rejected in chapter 1. Contacts and communication in the homesteads were regular, not sporadic. To be sure, there must have been a lot of frustration arising from unsuccessful attempts to communicate in the beginnings. However, nothing in the ecologies of human contacts during the homestead phases of the development of the colonies suggests reliance on stable pidgins for the purposes of communication. Rather, speakers must have proceeded through normal adult interlanguage stages of second-language acquisition in naturalistic settings toward closer approximations of the lexiﬁer.
Another incorrect assumption emerging from the literature is that colonial plantations developed overnight, so to speak, with all their peak population aggregates in place apparently since the foundation of the colonies, and with all the relevant non-European languages represented with their features competing concurrently. Instead, several important historical sources examined by, e.g., Baker (1990, 1993), Singler (1993, 1995), Migge (1993), and Mufwene (1992b, 1997c) conﬁrm Chaudenson’s position that the colonies developed gradually into plantation economic systems, although not necessarily at the same speed (see below). They suggest that creoles developed by continual restructuring of their lexiﬁers, subject to varying ecologies.
Baker (1996) observes correctly that the homestead phase lasted less time

2.2 Development of creoles

39

in Mauritius than in Réunion. Mauritian Creole would thus have developed quite early in the history of Mauritius and in a setting where, given the much smaller proportion of a founder population speaking colonial French, features that were congruent with those of non-European languages were favored. Hence the emergent creole diverged more signiﬁcantly from the structures of its lexiﬁer than Réunionnais.
The same can also be inferred from Le Page and Tabouret-Keller’s (1985) history of Caribbean colonies and the development of their creoles (see also Williams 1985). For instance, Jamaica, which was colonized by the English almost thirty years later than Barbados (1655 as opposed to 1627), adopted the sugar cane plantation system about twenty years faster than Barbados. Its non-European population grew even faster. By 1690, thirtyﬁve years after the English took Jamaica from the Spaniards (1655), the African population in Jamaica had grown to three times that of the European population: 30,000 vs. 10,000 (Williams 1985:31). The same year, Barbados had 50,000 Africans against 18,000 Europeans, at a ratio of less than three to one in sixty-three years (Williams 1985:31). By the mideighteenth century the proportion was over ten Africans to one European in Jamaica, whereas it did not exceed two to one in Barbados, even despite the continuous dwindling of the European population. Note also that in Barbados, the African population remained a minority for the ﬁrst thirty years, whereas in Jamaica it surpassed the European population within the ﬁrst twenty years. (More on demographic developments below.) Although Barbados did develop a basilect comparable to those of other Caribbean territories by the nineteenth century (Rickford and Handler 1994; Fields 1995) – probably later than Jamaica – it seems to have done so on a smaller scale, which accounts for its disappearance.
These historical observations also reveal that Africans from diﬀerent regions and language families – often coinciding with diﬀerent typological groups – became critical to diﬀerent stages of the development of Atlantic creoles. Curtin’s (1969) general demographic estimates in Table 1 (subject to conventional reservations on his ﬁgures) show that the proportion of Africans from the Windward Coast (speaking Mande, Kru, and Western Kwa languages) was signiﬁcant mostly during the homestead phases of some colonies, e.g., South Carolina and Jamaica. However, it became signiﬁcant in some other colonies, e.g., Barbados and Suriname, mostly during their plantation phases. Africans from the Gold Coast and the Bight of Benin (also speaking Kwa languages) became demographically signiﬁcant during the early eighteenth century, when the basilectalization of several Atlantic creoles was underway. Features of the lexiﬁers which were Kwalike were likely to gain selective advantage, barring other factors which may have inﬂuenced the restructuring diﬀerently (Mufwene 1989c, 1991a).

By the time the Central Africans (speaking Bantu languages) became demographically signiﬁcant, during the second half of the eighteenth century, most of the creoles must have already developed the greatest and/or more fundamental parts of their structures and norms. By the Founder Principle, since such demographic signiﬁcance did not obtain overnight, it was generally more cost-eﬀective for subsequent generations of immigrants (free, enslaved, and indentured) to learn the emerging local vernaculars rather than to develop new ones from scratch. Thus a great deal of features which became associated with the creoles in those early stages became more and more entrenched through adoption by newcomers who targeted the current speakers (creole and seasoned slaves) and would later serve as models for future newcomers.

The Founder Principle

favored continual transmission of the gradually basilectalizing local vernacular over the often-alleged break in its transmission. Both sociohistorical facts and the evolutionary account proposed in this book make it unnecessary to posit an antecedent pidgin to the creoles which developed in European plantation colonies of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans.
We must remember that the mortality rate was very high among the plantation laborers, although this population continued to increase until the nineteenth century. This trend of rapid population replacement and growth (as compared to communities growing by birth) also favored continual restructuring of the extant vernaculars among non-Europeans, especially after segregation was institutionalized on the large plantations and the non-Europeans had less and less fresh input from (colonial) European varieties. Even though the most drastic restructuring may have taken place during the initial and critical transition to the plantation phase in every colony, the basilectalization process probably continued up to the abolition of slavery in the nineteenth century or up to the total collapse of the plantation industry, which entailed the end of the importation of indentured labor sometimes from the same places which had formerly supplied slaves. Having proved adaptive several times before (by Wimsatt’s 1999a Generative Entrenchment principle), the features selected in earlier phases of plantation development stood a good chance of being selected for one reason or another during every round of the competition. However, there was always room for new selections to be substituted for, or added as alternates to, some older ones.
This is precisely the kind of evolutionary scenario that Le Page (1960:74–5) and Le Page and Tabouret-Keller (1985:47) suggest for Jamaican Creole. They divide the development of the colony in the eighteenth century into two major periods: the ﬁrst half, marked by the prevalence of Kwa-speaking populations, especially Twi and Ewe; and the second half, marked by a signiﬁcant Bantu presence. If we ignore the fact that Bantu morphosyntax is not exclusively agglutinating (Mufwene 1994b), the early Kwa prevalence would suﬃce to account for the selective advantage gained by the Kwa-like morphosyntactic features, most of them being (partially) congruent with patterns of some varieties of the lexiﬁer. These features include the invariance of the verb regarding person and number, the periphrastic marking of tense and nominal , the introduction of relative clauses with a complementizer (including ) rather than with a relative pronoun, and the signiﬁcant presence of serial verb constructions.
The few exceptions to the putative selective advantage of Kwa-like features include Palenquero (Maurer 1987), São Tomense, and Principense (Ferraz 1979), whose initial creators included signiﬁcant proportions of

Bantu speakers. Consequently, they reﬂect Bantu inﬂuence. Le Page and Tabouret-Keller (1985) conclude that São Tomense must have formed around the mid-seventeenth century (almost 150 years after the ﬁrst Bantu slaves had been imported from the Kongo Kingdom). This formation would have occurred after many Portuguese planters had left for Brazil, Portugal stopped sending convicts, and the demographic disproportion of Africans and Europeans increased dramatically in favor of Africans, with the Congo-Angola, Bantu-speaking region being the main supplier. The sugar cane plantation industry was then thriving and São Tomé continued to be an important slave depot. As a language contact setting under continuous dominant Bantu substrate inﬂuence, it developed a creole that selected Portuguese features more congruent with this linguistic ecology. These conditions account for structural diﬀerences between São Tomense and other Portuguese creoles which developed in places with less, or no, Bantu substrate input.
On the other hand, the developmental demographics of Suriname suggest that the restructuring of English into the present basilects of Saramaccan, Sranan, and its other creoles may have been quite advanced by the year 1700. This conjecture is supported by the settlement history of the colony as summarized below, as well as by Migge’s hypothesis (1999, chapter 2) that (most of) the diﬀerent Surinamese creoles may be traced back to the same “proto-creole” from which they separated between the late seventeenth and mid-eighteenth centuries. Table 2 shows that by 1700, the plantation phase must have been well underway. The disproportion between European and African populations was so great that, owing partly to the departure of most native English speakers, the restructuring of the local vernacular was inevitable. That is, in the very short time when English had established itself as the local lingua franca and/or vernacular, more and

more of those who served as linguistic models for the newcomers were nonnative speakers and fewer and fewer of them were ﬂuent in the original colonial koiné developed by the native speakers who had left. A rapid process of basilectalization was thus underway, leading to present-day Surinamese creole varieties with an interesting twist in the restructuring process, which is explained below.
Table 3 highlights the likely demographic prevalence of Kwa-speakers from the Slave Coast (Benin and Southern Nigeria), which would have favored periphrastic morphosyntax in the emergent local vernaculars. Kwalike features prevailed not only because of the numerical dominance of the Kwa-speakers but also because several of the same features, which were congruent with alternatives in the lexiﬁer, are attested disjunctively in some other languages, for instance, the Mande languages and, in some cases even the Bantu languages (Mufwene 1994b), as shown in section 2.3.2.
Table 4 underscores the role of the Founder Principle, suggesting that the later numerical signiﬁcance of Bantu-speakers probably had little eﬀect on the general developmental course of Surinamese vernaculars begun in the late seventeenth century. The fact that demographic dominance did not shift overnight may account for the closer structural proximity of Surinamese creoles to Kwa-like structures than to Bantu-like structures, i.e., for the greater impact of Kwa-like features on the selection of materials used in the basilectalization of the lexiﬁer. By the Founder Principle, the linguistic features of the populations that preceded had a greater chance of prevailing, especially if the newcomers included children. From a structural point of view, several factors that determine markedness values would have favored the Kwa-like features independently, for instance, salience, semantic transparency, regularity, and certainly the sheer frequency of those features that were already entrenched among the preceding slaves who served as models to newcomers. After all, the newcomers intended to learn the local vernacular the best way they could and did not plan to speak it deliberately according to principles of their native languages or others that they had previously spoken. What they contributed to further restructuring the

local vernacular was just a by-product of imperfect replication in their communicative acts.
The demographics of coastal South Carolina (table 5) suggest that the essence of Gullah’s basilect may have formed during the ﬁrst half of the eighteenth century, i.e., while the colony was shifting to the plantation industry as its most important economic activity and the slave population were growing rapidly. This development occurred especially after the institutionalization of race segregation in 1720, which reduced the amount of interaction between Europeans and Africans, making allowance for divergence between the colonial varieties spoken by their respective descendants. What table 5 does not show is that on the coast, where the rice ﬁelds and Gullah developed, the African population often rose to ten times that of the European population during the eighteenth century.
Taking into account structural facts, table 6 suggests that the Bantu presence in coastal South Carolina became signiﬁcant (about 70 percent of the African population) perhaps toward the end of the most important phase of basilectalization.11 This may explain why there is no identiﬁable Bantu inﬂuence in Gullah’s grammatical system (except of course for features which were congruent with those of other languages). It is also possible that gradual basilectalization was still in process. If so, the nature of the linguistic feature competition, compounded with the short duration of the Bantu prevalence and with the non-negligible presence of West Africans speaking nonagglutinating languages (especially Mande and Kwa) during the second half of the eighteenth century, simply oﬀset any potential for dominant Bantu structural inﬂuence on the then-emergent Gullah. Rawley (1981:335) observes that during 1733–1807 the South Carolinian colonists “secured about one-ﬁfth of their slaves from Senegambia, one-sixth from the Windward Coast, and two-ﬁfths from Angola.” He also suggests that throughout the history of colonial South Carolina, “Guinea (from Gold Coast to Calabar)” – the Kwa-speaking area – remained a constant important source of slaves (441), which must have played an important role in giving selective advantage to Kwa-like periphrastic morphosyntax. The fact

that Bantu languages do not totally lack periphrastic morphosyntax, as noted above, may have encouraged the oﬀset.
Overall, in some colonies, such as South Carolina, Virginia, and Réunion, the Africans remained minorities for the ﬁrst thirty to ﬁfty years, whereas in others such as Suriname, Mauritius (Baker 1996), Jamaica, and apparently Guyana (Rickford 1987), the plantation phase came about rather rapidly and brought along an early slave majority.12 In the particular case of Suriname, founded by the English in 1651 with an equal proportion of Europeans and Africans (apparently two hundred of each group), the proportion of Africans doubled by 1665 (3,000 against 1,500 Europeans, in fourteen years), and reached almost twelve to one by 1700 (8,926 Africans against 745 Europeans of mixed composition in about ﬁfty years). In 1667 the Dutch took over Suriname and by 1670 (nineteen years after the foundation of the colony) almost all the English planters left, taking with them more than two thousand slaves. This change drastically reduced (by two thirds) the proportion of speakers of various approximations of English, while the local vernacular that had been developing from it was retained. (This vernacular was certainly already restructured and variable, but it is not clear to what extent it was structurally similar to today’s Surinamese creoles.) Along with Arends (1986, 1989) and Plag (1993), I suspect that this local vernacular was gradually restructured further away from its lexiﬁer with subsequent importations of slaves, although the essence of the basilects may have been in place by the end of the seventeenth century, and certainly by the ﬁrst half of the eighteenth century, for which evidence is available in Sranan.
The removal of the Europeans’ colonial varieties of English from Suriname is one of the most signiﬁcant factors accounting for the notable divergence of basilectal Saramaccan from structures of colonial English varieties, a fact on which Alleyne (1980) and Bickerton (1984) agree. However, the former characterizes Saramaccan as the creole most inﬂuenced by African substrate languages, whereas the latter presents it as the most radical one, created, expanded, and stabilized by children. In reality,

The Founder Principle

the new ecology after the Dutch took over Suriname made a lot of room for restructuring away from the lexiﬁer, under the inﬂuence of other languages, including the Portuguese-based vernacular brought from Brazil and elsewhere (see below). However, this ecology does not suggest that there was a break in the transmission of the lexiﬁer; it merely suggests that the lexiﬁer was transmitted in a (perhaps signiﬁcantly) restructured form.
In South Carolina, the ﬁrst colonists, who arrived from Barbados in 1670, started with small farms and deer skin trade. They typically lived in homesteads until the dawn of the eighteenth century, when the rice ﬁelds were grown. These became the primary industry by the middle of the century. Large plantations developed with segregated patterns of interaction between the African slaves and the European colonists (including indentured servants), especially since 1720, when the territory became a crown colony (Wood 1974). As indicated above, the Africans did not become the colonial majority, with about 90 percent of them living on or along the coast, until about 1715. The institutionalization of race segregation must have expedited the basilectalization process, although the earliest available written evidence of Gullah dates from the nineteenth century, with Simms (1839). Here too the contact ecology suggests transmission of a gradually restructured lexiﬁer, through generations of creole and seasoned slaves, rather than a break in its transmission.
The development of the Guyana colony is partly reminiscent of plantations in the Suriname interior, except that, unlike the Portuguese-speaking Jewish planters in Suriname, the British ultimately gained the political rule of Guyana from the Dutch. According to Rickford (1987:51f), English planters originating in Barbados, Antigua, and St. Kitts began to settle in Essequibo and Demerara, then parts of the Dutch colony that extended all the way from Suriname, in the 1740s. Holm (1989:462) reports that “by 1760 the British outnumbered the Dutch in Demerara; in 1774 the colony established its own administrative capital, Stabroek,” the antecedent of today’s Georgetown. According to Rickford, “English military forces were in control of the colonies after 1796” and the Dutch “ceded the colonies to England in 1814” (p. 51f). After the British won the rivalry, there was “a great inﬂux of slaves from the British West Indies and West Africa that quadrupled the slave population in the British Guiana colonies before the slave trade was declared illegal” (Holm 1989:462).
There is little in this scenario that suggests a diﬀerent pattern of plantation and language development in Guyana. One possibility is that a Dutch creole, similar to Berbice Dutch, had already developed by the ﬁrst half of the eighteenth century. This vernacular would gradually be replaced by Guyanese English Creole, which developed subsequent to the English economic, and later military and political, colonization of present-day

2.2 Development of creoles

49

Guyana. Berbice Dutch would thus be a relic of a contact-induced, restructured Dutch vernacular spoken over a wider territory. Another possibility is that, consistent with the scenario developed here, Berbice Dutch developed concurrently with Guyanese English Creole, as the plantations grew bigger. The trend was for European colonial languages appropriated by the slaves to basilectalize as the size of the slave populations increased more by importations than by birth, segregation was institutionalized, and the proportion of second-language speakers exceeded that of creole slaves, the native speakers of colonial vernaculars.
There is now evidence, from Samuel Augustus Matthews’ (1793) The lying hero that a basilectal Kittitian Creole was in existence by the second half of the eighteenth century. However, this does not entail that one was in existence during the ﬁrst half of the same century or earlier (Corcoran and Mufwene 1999). Nor is it evident that the English colonists who came from St. Kitts necessarily brought with them slaves who spoke basilectal Creole (ibid.). The colonists who brought slaves from earlier Caribbean colonies are likely to have been those who owned small farms and were being bought out, or put out of business, by the expanding plantation estates (Mufwene 1999b). Their slaves came from intimate contact settings of homesteads which did not favor the development of basilectal creoles, although the lexiﬁer was generally being restructured in the colonies, among Europeans and Africans and the like. On the other hand, the growing plantation industry during the English colonization of Guyana, with the increasing massive importation of slaves from Africa during the second half of the eighteenth and ﬁrst quarter of the nineteenth centuries, favored the development of an English creole in the direction of the basilect.
Without demographic data, I cannot determine how diﬀerent the development scenario proposed here for Guyanese Creole is from that of Gullah. In South Carolina, the evidence suggests that among Africans the local vernacular started to basilectalize perhaps ﬁfty years after its foundation, regardless of whether or not some of the original slaves may have spoken a basilectal variety on leaving Barbados. During the homestead period those who came speaking a basilectal variety had no reason for preserving it, as well recognized by Winford (1993) in the context of the development of AAVE. (I articulate in Mufwene 1999b all sorts of sociohistorical arguments against the speculation that Caribbean English creoles had deterministic inﬂuence on the development of Gullah and/or AAVE.)
Overall, nothing in the development of these colonies suggests a break in the transmission of the lexiﬁer, only that the ever-changing ecology favored its gradual basilectalization at diﬀerent stages, and more and more restructured varieties, along with earlier less restructured varieties, served as

50

The Founder Principle

targets for newcomers. This accounts for the continua associated with creole speech communities, as well explained by Winford (1997b).

2.2.4 The post-homestead phase and the varying basilectalization phase
It appears that during the initial, homestead phase of each colony’s development, most of the slaves lived on small farms or at trade posts, rather than on the handful of then-burgeoning plantations. It is very unlikely that anything close to today’s creoles was then developing on a large scale, even if subsystems close to those of today’s basilects may have been shaping up on the plantations or in the speech of some individuals. Rather, approximations of European speech are likely to have been the trend among the nonEuropeans living fairly closely with the European colonists. There is no reason why mentally normal non-European laborers living intimately, and/or interacting regularly, with European indentured servants would of necessity have developed diﬀerent speech varieties during that period, especially the children. All the non-native speakers must have spoken approximations of the local colonial koinés.
After the colonies switched to the second, agricultural-economy phase, the sugar cane plantations or rice ﬁelds claimed 80–90 percent of the slave populations. As these economic systems needed intensive labor to prosper, this period is marked by a general increase in slave imports, which led to a typically overwhelming slave majority on the plantations, on many of which they easily constituted the 80 percent of the population stipulated by Bickerton (1981) as a condition for the development of creoles.13 The increased importations of slaves to meet the labor demands on plantations also brought with them the fear of a “black majority” (Wood 1974) and the concomitant institutionalization of race segregation. As the working conditions on the plantations became harsher, life expectancy dropped, and the mortality rate (even among children) increased. Consequently, the plantation populations increased more by importation of new labor both from Africa and Europe than by birth. This rapid rate of population replacement bore on the restructuring of the laborers’ vernaculars by creating situations in which fewer and fewer speakers that were suﬃciently ﬂuent in what they had found locally served as linguistic models to those who came after them.
Several censuses reveal a high proportion of children (up to fourteen years of age) on the plantations, although many of them were not locally born. During the second half of the eighteenth century, more and more children in the same age group were imported, particularly from Bantuspeaking Central Africa (Lovejoy 1989). This situation may indeed be interpreted to provide support for the language bioprogram hypothesis, since I argue that the basilects of creoles such as Gullah, Jamaican Patwa,

2.2 Development of creoles

51

Bajan, and even those of Suriname probably did not develop before the eighteenth century. However, more consistent with the hypothesis of gradual restructuring away from the lexiﬁer is the following alternative: as in any other speech community, the children were relatively successful in acquiring the local colonial vernacular (however variable it was), restructuring it the least (except in favoring some of its own variants) and thus helping its features become more and more entrenched. Thus, children must have slowed down the ongoing restructuring of the local vernacular.
Overall, the above post-homestead situation entailed several things: (i) Outside work time, the African slaves had limited contacts with even
the European indentured servants who worked with them. (ii) The newly arrived Africans learned the colonial vernacular mostly
from the creole and “seasoned” slaves. (iii) After the creole populations became the minorities on the plantations,
continually restructured varieties often became the models for some of the newcomers. This restructuring process led to the basilectalization of the colonial vernacular among its segregated users, i.e., the emergence of sociolects identiﬁed as basilectal.14 (iv) The basilectalization process, whose social concomitant was the disfranchising of the new varieties as creoles, was typically gradual after the initial critical phase of drastic restructuring, probably lasting until after the last non-European indentured labor were imported.15 (v) In the history of each creole, there is a particular period during which the most signiﬁcant part of basilectalization must have taken place under the dominant inﬂuence of speakers of some languages, typically those speaking Kwa languages in the case of Atlantic creoles.16 (vi) Basilectalization must have halted near the end of the plantation economic systems, during the second half of the nineteenth century, and with the stabilization and growth of populations of African descent by birth. (vii) Finally, increased post-formative cross-plantation contacts may have allowed (more) mutual inﬂuence of creoles on each other, perhaps leaving fewer diﬀerences among vernaculars which in the main developed independently, even in parallel and similar, though not identical, fashions.17 The last statement makes it normal for creoles that developed on diﬀerent plantations and in diﬀerent colonies to diﬀer from one another, which they normally do. On the other hand, it also makes it surprising that they do not diﬀer more than they do, which has prompted Bickerton (1981 and later works) among others and, before them, Coelho (1880–88), to invoke a language(-acquisition)-universal account. This is by no means the only explanation. First of all, there is no compelling reason for downplaying

52

The Founder Principle

diﬀerences in favor of similarities (Alleyne 1980, 1986); both are all equally signiﬁcant.
Second, typological similarities among the languages in contact are equally signiﬁcant (Sankoﬀ and Brown 1976; Muysken 1983; Thomason 1983; Sankoﬀ 1984; Mufwene 1986b; Keesing 1988; Singler 1988; and Corne 1999). No (major) restructuring of some subsystems of the lexiﬁer was necessary if these were (partially) shared with most of the substrate languages. Thus the overlap in function between distal demonstratives and deﬁnite articles accounts for the common choice of the former when the deﬁnite article system was not familiar to substrate speakers. Likewise, crosslinguistic similarities in the meanings of  explain why a verb meaning “ﬁnish” (the case of done in English) has typically been selected to mark  when, for one reason or another, the morphosyntactic convention available in the lexiﬁer’s standard variety (have + Past Participle in English or avoir/être + Past Participle in French) was disfavored.
When structures of most of the substrate languages were very similar typologically, their common features often prevailed over alternatives provided by the lexiﬁer. Sankoﬀ and Brown (1976) show this phenomenon well with the bracketing of the relative clause with the demonstrative ia (< English here) in Tok Pisin. Sankoﬀ (1993) shows the same regarding the alternative structure of focus markers in Tok Pisin, for instance when speakers leave the focused noun phrase in situ and postpose the marker yet to it. The same kind of explanation applies to the fact that Melanesian English pidgins have a / distinction in the noun phrase, an / distinction for nonsingular ﬁrst-person pronouns, and a transitive marker on the verb, as these distinctions are shared by most of the substrate languages (Keesing 1988). Corne (1999) shows similar development with Tayo. Interestingly the contact settings where these creoles developed are closer to those that Chaudenson (1979 and later works) characterizes as endogenous, as opposed to the exogenous settings of the Atlantic and Indian Ocean plantation colonies.
In learning an umpteenth language speakers typically apply the principle of least effort, trying to identify things that are the same in the lexiﬁer and the languages they already speak, or settling for alternatives that cause no communication problems and/or satisfy their traditional communicative needs. When there was more typological diversity, competition of features was more likely to be resolved by factors other than congruence (alone), e.g., by the salience or regularity of a particular marker. This was the case, for instance, in marking nominal  in Atlantic English creoles with dem rather than with the suﬃx {-Z}. (The role of the lexiﬁer or some of the substrate languages is never to be overlooked!) Variation often followed from such typological diversity. While the number of alternatives could be

2.2 Development of creoles

53

reduced, mutual accommodation among speakers by no means entails the elimination of diversity. One way or another, typological kinship or lack thereof bore on the development of the new vernaculars.
Given the role now assigned to the pre-plantation, homestead phase of the colonies in the development of creoles, typological similarities among the European languages are especially signiﬁcant (Thomason 1980, 1983). Several shared features of the European early colonial speech were likely to be selected by the slave founder populations in similar ethnographic ecologies. As the founder populations’ speech became the target of subsequent arrivals of slaves, at least some of the same features became more and more entrenched as they were passed on through successive selections and adaptations marking the gradual developments of the new vernaculars in the direction of the basilects.
This picture does not suggest complete chaos. Rather, the contact scenario advocated here is one in which individual speakers’ strategies of communication competed with one another, and those which appeared less marked prevailed over others (Mufwene 1989c, 1991a). Except in cases where the newcomers had signiﬁcant linguistic homogeneity and where, almost overnight, they prevailed demographically over the creole and seasoned populations, the more deeply entrenched features had a greater selective advantage over new features. (This scenario would not have prevented some of the new features from being retained as alternatives and perhaps eventually replacing some of the older ones.)
As observed above, most basilectal features date from the early days of the new vernaculars. As shown by Baker (1995a, 1995b), they go back to the earliest days of contacts between Europeans and non-Europeans. Basilectalization as a communal process amounts to the change that showed dense clusters of basilectal features in the speech of many slaves. The proportion of basilectal speakers may have never been higher than today (Mufwene 1994a), in part because basilectalization did not entail generalized shifts in speech patterns for all slaves. Instead, the evidence collected by, e.g., Brasch (1981), Rickford (1987), and Lalla and D’Costa (1990) suggests that the creole speech continuum dates probably, and naturally, from the early colonial days, as suggested earlier by Alleyne (1980) and explained later by Winford (1997b) in the context of the Caribbean. My guess is that the mesolects must have always been the dominant varieties everywhere. The basilectalization I advocate thus amounts to the consolidation of basilectal features into clearly identiﬁable sociolects, without ruling out the gradual introduction and integration of new alternatives. Also, the building materials – “matériaux de construction” in Chaudenson’s 1992 terminology – were not new. They have merely been put into new uses by exaptation, thus producing new construction types. As has been shown in the

54

The Founder Principle

literature on grammaticization, the principles used were often, if not typically, extensions of models available in the lexiﬁer (Chaudenson 1989, 1992) and were consistent with patterns in any of the other languages it came into contact with (Mufwene 1989a, 1996a).

2.2.5 Continuity from lexiﬁers to creoles
It is convenient to start this section with Bruyn’s (1996) and Plag’s (1999) claim that there is no grammaticization in creoles. Contrary to Mufwene (1996a), they assume that this diachronic process is strictly internally motivated and that any structural development which started before the identiﬁcation of a vernacular as a creole is not to be associated with the latter’s history. The position is obviously based on the mistaken assumption that creoles are not continuous evolutions from their lexiﬁers.
As argued brieﬂy below and in chapter 3, much of the so-called internally motivated change is contact-induced, particularly because several changes aﬀect dialects before they spread to whole languages. Since the distinction between dialect and language is not structural, it is diﬃcult to take their claim seriously when we consider what has been learned in recent decades from historical dialectology (e.g., Trudgill 1986). Ironically, the processes that Bruyn and Plag claim started in the languages out of whose contact the relevant creoles developed are the very ones which seem to have led linguists to single them out as separate languages rather than as dialects of their lexiﬁers. They are also the very processes that led Chaudenson (1989, 1992) to argue that the grammatical strategies associated with creoles are extensions of principles that already applied under some constraints in the lexiﬁer. If anything, Bruyn’s and Plag’s observation should be used to argue that creoles are normal outcomes of language evolution.
These considerations make more compelling the case for approaching the development of creoles’ structures in light of the literature on grammaticization. Certain items and constructions in the target language are put into new, exaptive uses within the constraints of the evolving grammar, representing an ongoing modiﬁcation of the target. No particular age group seems to be privileged for such innovations, and contact as a cause of such exaptations is not necessarily precluded, since interference is normal in the speech of multilinguals.
As shown by several papers in Traugott and Heine (1991), especially those by Hopper and by Lichtenberk, grammaticization (a form of restructuring) is a concomitant of shifts in patterns of usage. As explained in chapter 1, creoles’ structural peculiarities have developed largely by exaptive processes, thus similarly to grammaticization processes. Some brief examples will suﬃce here in which emphasis lies more on Chaudenson’s

2.2 Development of creoles

55

“matériaux de construction” than on how the selected materials were exapted. In several English creoles, the general -marker done may easily be derived both in function and in meaning from constructions such as I’m done “I have ﬁnished” and from its clearly  function in the lexiﬁer, as in you’ve done broke it now.18 The fact that in the emerging vernaculars copula-less nonverbal predicate phrases, as in dem tall “they [are] tall,” were becoming the norm rather than the exception made it possible to use done predicatively without a copula in  constructions. A contributing factor to this evolution is the reanalysis of done as a verb meaning “ﬁnish,” as in mi don mi jab “I (have) ﬁnished my job.” The normal option of using it with a verbal object produced constructions such as mi don taak “I have ﬁnished talking” which would be exapted to express . All happens within the limits of what either the lexiﬁer or the new system evolving from it allows (including in this case the absence of any inﬂections on the verbal complement of done in creoles, although there are fossils of this such as im don lef/gaan “he/she has left/gone”). In AAVE, the verbal object of done is still required to be in the past participle or past tense, as in he done eaten/ate/?*eat or I done did/done/*do it, just as in other nonstandard English vernaculars.
Likewise, the  marker [dəz] in Gullah and [dɔz] in Guyanese may not only be derived etymologically from English does [d z, dəz] but may also be related to its function as an   marker with nonstative verbs, as in Mary does say those kinds of things. More signiﬁcantly, Ihalainen (1991) documents nonemphatic periphrastic do constructions with a / meaning in East Somerset, Southern England, and observes that “although the periphrastic use of do is a provincialism today, it was common in Standard English until the end of the 18th century” (p. 148). If does, in the unstressed form [dəz], did not already function as a  marker in some of the English dialects to which those who developed English creoles had been exposed (e.g., British Southwestern and Irish Englishes, cf. Clarke 1997a), patterns of usage of emphatic does could still have independently favored its grammaticization into a  marker in creoles. This may indeed be what happened in the development of uses like this in such English dialects in the ﬁrst place, possibly under Celtic substrate inﬂuence.
In the same vein, taking into account the consequence of the loss of verbal inﬂections, serial verb constructions in creoles show some etymological connection with Verb + Verb sequences such as go/come get, went ’n’got, and go ﬁshing in English or aller/venir prendre in French. Substrate inﬂuence notwithstanding, the presence of constructions such as [take NP and Verb] and [Verb NP and give] in the lexiﬁer is not entirely irrelevant to the development of “instrumental” and “dative serial verb constructions,”

The Founder Principle

especially when and is reduced to a mere nasal consonant in such combinations. (More on this syntactic construction below.)
Research on creoles contributes the following observation to the literature on grammaticization, viz., the sources of the “matériaux de construction” need not be the sources of the principles for using them. Thus grammatical substrate inﬂuence is not incompatible with items from the lexiﬁer which have only partially congruent patterns. This accounts for the wider systemic distribution of serial verb constructions in creoles, in which there are uses without models in the lexiﬁer. Take for instance “dative serial verb constructions” with the serial verb “give,” as NP1 BUY NP2 GIVE NP3 “NP1 BUY NP2 FOR NP3.” The same kind of explanation applies to the postnominal use of dem in Jamaican Creole, in combination with a prenominal deﬁnite article, as in the di bway dem “the boy-s,” a pattern that is diﬀerent from nonstandard English dem boys “those/the boys.” In addition, note in almost all Atlantic English creoles the postnominal usage of dem with proper names for  , as in Kate (an) dem “Kate and company,” “Kate and her associates,” or “Kate and her family/ friends.” However, Tagliamonte (1999) reveals that such independent, though perhaps not widespread, uses of   have been attested in some dialects of British English. Their prominence in AAVE and English creoles spoken by descendants of Africans may thus be more a matter of congruence of patterns than exclusive substrate inﬂuence.

2.2.6 Diversity in the selection of features
This topic is elaborated in chapter 5. Here I present only a sketch of diversity in varieties from which the model features were selected and of the role of markedness in regulating the process.
There is no reason for expecting all the grammaticized morphemes to have been selected from the same dialect of the metropolitan ancestor of the lexiﬁer, or for expecting features of any new (ex-)colonial English dialect today to have evolved from one single ancestor. And there is no a priori reason why some features could not have been selected from substrate languages, except possibly that targeting the lexiﬁer disfavored the substrate languages. The contact settings brought together speakers of diﬀerent dialects of the lexiﬁer (Le Page 1960; Le Page and Tabouret-Keller 1985; Algeo 1991; Chaudenson 1992); thus their features collapsed into one larger pool in which they competed with each other.
The mixing of grammatical features suggested above falls out happily from the natural selection of features advocated by the ecology-sensitive model of markedness proposed in Mufwene (1991a). In a nutshell, markedness values are not predetermined by Universal Grammar, but rather by

2.2 Development of creoles

57

several factors, some structural and some others nonstructural, which give selective advantage to one or another of the competing forms or structures. At the ethnographic level of competing languages, the vernacular or lingua franca associated with the group in power typically had a selective advantage over other languages, as explained below. Consequently most of the lexical “matériaux de construction” were selected from the lexiﬁer, according to the model proposed above and illustrated in section 2.3.2. As observed in chapter 1 and earlier in this chapter, the lexiﬁers of creoles were truly set-theory unions of competing varieties and, later, of koinés which developed locally. During the formation of these creoles, the more common or frequent, the more salient, more regular, or more transparent alternatives were favored over the less common or frequent, the less salient, the less regular, or the opaque alternatives in the disjunctive pool of morphosyntactic features. For instance,  with done, which cannot be contracted in English, must have been more salient than the alternative perfect construction with have + Past Participle (in which have is often reduced) or the alternative with Past Tense only.
Assuming these factors, we can explain selections which might otherwise be surprising. Frequency may account for why the forms lef(t) and dead are more common than the base forms leave and die in English creoles, if the verbs were used more often in the  function. This state of aﬀairs apparently led to their reanalysis as base forms. Thus it is quite normal in most of these creoles to say wi go lef/dead “we will leave/die.” Sometimes functional specialization followed from equally frequent alternatives, such as do and done, with only the latter used in English creoles for “ﬁnish” and . The weaker form of does [dəz], which is consistent with its phonological representation as [dɔz] in creoles that do not have a schwa, has specialized for , whereas did is the mesolectal marker of , as an alternative to bin/ben/men/en. Another example is the pair go/gone, in which case only go was grammaticized as a  marker and gone (pronounced [gaan] in West Indian varieties) is typically used in completive constructions without a stated  argument, as in im gaan “he has gone, he (has) left.”
We can now return to the selection of “matériaux de construction” and their exaptations to meet the communicative needs of the emergent vernaculars. As much as we have been haunted by the “Cafeteria Principle,” neither the building materials nor the principles for using them need have originated in the same sources.19 Assuming that creole vernaculars developed by the normal process of language change in contact ecologies, some heterogeneity in the sources of structural features must be allowed both from within the lexiﬁer and from the substrate languages. The challenge we cannot continue dodging is that of coming up with adequate explanations

58

The Founder Principle

for this recombination of features. The question here is: what principles or constraints regulate the selection of features from these competing sources into the new vernaculars’ systems? The summary of Mufwene’s (1991a) ecology-sensitive model of markedness presented above is an attempt to address the question, although much more work remains to be done. There is no empirical reason for expecting the sources of creoles’ features to be any more homogeneous than those of, for instance, English and the Romance languages are. (See, e.g., Nagle 1995; Wright 1995; Posner 1996; and Kroch, Taylor, and Ringe 2000.)
Among the advantages of the proposed approach is that the explanations are consistent both with the settlement histories of the diﬀerent colonies in which creoles developed and with the emergence of varieties such as Newfoundland vernacular English out of the contact of dialects of the same language, in this case primarily British Southwestern and Irish Southeastern dialects of English (Clarke 1997a). Trudgill (1986) presents a survey of such dialects, sketching out a selection account which anticipated Mufwene’s (1991a) ecology-sensitive markedness model. According to this, the markedness values of the diﬀerent features are determined relative to their other competitors in the contact setting rather than to whatever options happen to be available worldwide, a number of which are unknown to those appropriating and restructuring the lexiﬁer. These selection constraints apply any time there are elements in competition, throughout the gradual evolution of the lexiﬁer into the new vernacular. The constraints also make allowance for preserving variation, especially when factors determining markedness values are in conﬂict and none is more heavily weighted than the other alternative(s). We can account for this peculiarity by observing that creoles’ systems are typically nonmonolithic (Mufwene 1992a), which has led several creolists since DeCamp (1971) to misguidedly posit a process of “decreolization” as debasilectalization rather than as “loss of a vernacular’s social status as a creole.”
At the population level, not all speakers need select from the same range of alternatives. Thus, more than one morphosyntactic strategy may have been selected into a creole for more or less the same function. For instance, Gullah has retained the  construction [də] + Verb along with the typically copula-less Verb-in alternative. Sometimes it combines them both as [də] + Verb-in. Likewise, Jamaican Patwa has the alternative  constructions gwayn + Verb, a go + Verb, and wi + Verb. Such alternatives also exist in other nonstandard vernaculars. Newfoundland vernacular English too has an alternative progressive construction with [də], just like Gullah, aside from its regular be + V-ing construction. All such similarities in contact settings and in the principles which regulate the

2.2 Development of creoles

59

restructuring of a language into a new system make it unnecessary to treat creoles as atypical cases of language evolution. This is a conclusion to which I return in some of the following chapters.

2.2.7 Summary
I have argued that the histories of the colonies in which creoles developed suggest that no language-development processes were involved that were unique to these new vernaculars, just the same ones usually assumed in historical linguistics, with the exception of the lopsided emphasis on language contact. Since in each case the lexiﬁer was being appropriated by nonnative speakers who spoke diverse languages, we cannot deny that it was inﬂuenced by these other languages, just like several noncreole languages have been inﬂuenced by others in their histories. More strikingly, varieties such as Irish English, which need not, in fact should not, be called creoles, owe many of their peculiarities originally to appropriations of English by nonnative speakers and thus to substrate inﬂuence (e.g., Odlin 1997, forthcoming). This was part of the restructuring process.
In investigating the developments of these new vernaculars, we must remember that their lexiﬁers were nonstandard. This fact should enable us to gauge more accurately the extent to which the targets have been restructured after being appropriated by new groups. We must also remember that these lexiﬁers were not communally monolithic but instead consisted of varieties that developed out of contacts of several metropolitan varieties. For many European speakers these dialect contacts were being experienced for the ﬁrst time in the colonies, despite Buccini’s (1995) otherwise plausible remark that the restructuring of the lexiﬁers probably started in metropolitan port cities. This position also accommodates claims of inﬂuence of nautical varieties on colonial koinés. The contact-based nature of the lexiﬁer is also made more complex by the presence in the colonies of large proportions of indentured Europeans who were not native speakers. It is debatable to what extent non-Europeans could (consistently) distinguish native from nonnative speakers of the lexiﬁers among the Europeans.
The colonies also shifted gradually to plantation economy at variable speed, depending in part on whether they were ﬁrst-generation colonies (like Virginia, Barbados, St. Kitts, and Réunion) or second-generation colonies (like Mauritius, Guyana, Jamaica, and South Carolina), according to Chaudenson (1979, 1992). Second-generation colonies were settled from ﬁrst-generation colonies and beneﬁted from infrastructure-development experience acquired in the latter. Thus, the homestead phase (“société d’habitation”) lasted longer for ﬁrst-generation colonies than for

60

The Founder Principle

second-generation colonies. However, these are matters of degree. One is certainly justiﬁed in identifying third-generation colonies, such as Georgia in relation to South Carolina, based on the development of rice ﬁelds, although its founder population originated in Europe. Overall, later-generation colonies beneﬁted from the experience of colonists and slaves who migrated from previously settled ones and developed their economic infrastructures faster toward the plantation system.
This shift to the plantation socioeconomic system was marked not only by segregation between Europeans and non-Europeans but also by rapid population replacements which facilitated continual restructuring of the local vernaculars, fostered by the increasing attrition of proﬁcient speakers. A concomitant of the socioeconomic change was the basilectalization of the local vernaculars appropriated by non-Europeans. A sociolect emerged that was structurally more and more divergent from the original lexiﬁer. However, because the rapid population replacement proceeded incrementally, most features of every preceding population’s vernacular had selective advantage accorded them by the simple fact that the local vernacular was being targeted. This explains the Founder Principle, according to which structural features of today’s creoles were largely determined by those that were produced by the founder populations. Especially during the homestead phase, when the population increased by birth and by moderate rates of immigrations of settlers and/or importations of labor (Thomas 1998 in the case of Virginia), every new group of speakers of the locally evolving vernacular increased the number of transmitters of the founder population’s speech. This increase was accomplished particularly through those who acquired it almost natively and restructured it little. Through them the founder features that survived successive layers of transmission became more and more deeply entrenched, and thus more likely to maintain selective advantage over, or keep up with, alternatives brought later.
As a concept, the Founder Principle, is adopted here rather loosely to underscore the inﬂuence of earlier populations in every colony, not always those who founded the colony. Because newcomers and children born in the colony targeted the local vernacular, the basilectalization process was more a by-product of imperfect acquisition of the target by second-language learners, which was to be expected under the conditions of population replacement explained above, than any attempt to develop a separate means of interethnic communication (cf. Baker 1997). Still, all newcomers, like locally born children, aimed at speaking the local vernacular the best way they could, though not everybody was equally successful. The fact that it was already variable also made it impossible for learners to acquire it with all its variants. The selections made by the diﬀerent learners made ample room for divergence from the status quo. One must also remember that as

2.2 Development of creoles

61

time went by the models available to the newcomers were not all equally ﬂuent, which made more room for divergence.
The varieties that were basilectalizing did not necessarily replace the mesolectal ones nor the earliest approximations of the European languages which developed earlier. As newcomers were exposed to variable targets, they probably also developed a sense of those varieties that were rated better socially. This factor must have prevented the replacement of earlier approximations of the lexiﬁer by later varieties. Consequently, the eﬀects of the varieties that developed during the critical periods of the transition into the plantation phases should not be over-rated. Assuming that these critical periods in the basilectalization process are analogous to the critical period in ontogenetic language development, I surmise that the rest of the gradual restructuring was only minimal, although it must have continued up to the end of the plantation economic systems. This is the period of increased non-European indentured labor after the abolition of slavery, which is worth more attention.
Chaudenson (1992) observes that the Indian indentured servants in Mauritius do not seem to have contributed signiﬁcantly to the development of Mauritian Creole’s structures. As noted above, this view is not contradicted by Rickford’s (1987:65–9) position that the development of Guyanese Creole must have continued up to the post-emancipation time, when the East Indian indentured laborers became the majority working on the plantations. Although today’s East Indians are very much associated with basilectal Guyanese Creole, because they are the majority in the rural areas where it is typically spoken (Edwards 1975, Rickford 1987), the features associated with the East Indian inﬂuence are rather minimal compared to Indic inﬂuence on, for instance, South African Indian English as described by Mesthrie (1992a). Rickford cites from Devonish (1978:39–42) an Object + Verb word order and the transitive verb marker. However, the evidence is so minimal that we can also agree with Winford (1997b:245) that “the Indians on the plantations acquired the basilectal creole spoken by Africans, and continued to preserve it (as did rural Africans) as the rural creole that survives today.”
The histories of the European colonies in which creoles developed also suggest that their ethnographic ecologies relative to the same lexiﬁers (at least by name) did not replicate each other. Despite those similarities on which most of the literature has dwelled, ecological variation in structureinternal and external factors accounts for cross-territorial structural diﬀerences among the creole vernaculars which developed. An important factor to bear in mind in all such settings is the extent of typological kinship among the language varieties that came into contact. In the next section, I focus on some preliminary details of the Founder Principle.

62

The Founder Principle

2.3 Evidence for the Founder Principle
The evidence for the Founder Principle is twofold: ethnographic and structural. This section is accordingly organized into two subsections that highlight this aspect of the development of creoles. Each one remains programmatic. I leave it up to future research to ﬂesh out details of the hypothesis. What follows should, however, suﬃce to validate the main tenets of the approach advocated here.

2.3.1 Ethnographic considerations
Little discussed in connection with the development of creoles is the competition that took place among the languages and dialects that came in contact and the nature of the selection applied among them. Yet several European languages other than the lexiﬁer were spoken by indentured servants and other immigrants in the colonies during the homestead phase and even later on the plantations. One of the pieces of evidence for the Founder Principle lies in the selection of a particular language as the local lingua franca which eventually became the vernacular and gradually displaced and/or replaced the other languages. In the case of North America, for instance, English came to prevail at the expense of African, Native American, and other European languages. One can in fact argue that the present condition of endangerment of Native American languages is a belated consequence of those early selections made tacitly by the founder population. I return to this question in chapter 6. Here, I focus on other ethnographic aspects of the Founder Principle.
The relevant evidence is manifold and begins at the macro-level of the contact of languages and with the European:non-European founder population ratios. Cross-territorial diﬀerences in the proportions of speakers of the lexiﬁers and of the substrate languages within the founder populations account for a large amount of variation from one creole to another. This alone may account for some diﬀerences between Bajan and other Caribbean English creoles, between Réunionnais and Mauritian, between Martiniquais and Haitian, between Gullah and Jamaican, and between Gullah and AAVE. Greater European:non-European population disproportions obtained (faster) in Mauritius than in Réunion, in Haiti than in Martinique, in Jamaica, Guyana, and – to a lesser extent – Coastal South Carolina than in Barbados, and in Coastal South Carolina and Georgia than in Virginia and the American hinterlands. This variation explains why, although each of these regional vernaculars has its basilect spoken by a small proportion of the overall population, Réunionnais diverges less from its lexiﬁer than Mauritian does, Martiniquais less than Haitian, Bajan less

2.3 Evidence for the Founder Principle

63

than Jamaican and Guyanese Creoles, and AAVE less than Gullah. Everywhere, the majority of the population speaks some level of the mesolect.
The diﬀerence in the duration of the initial European-majority phase is also an important factor bearing on cross-creole variation. The initial European majority lasted longer in Barbados and Virginia than in Jamaica, Guyana, and Coastal South Carolina. In fact, it was never reversed in Virginia. In coastal South Carolina, rice ﬁelds reached and held much higher African:European population disproportions than the cotton plantations of the American Southeastern hinterlands. There were also many more small farms maintained in the hinterlands than on the coast. These factors explain why Gullah is conﬁned to the coastal area. (For South Carolina, see Wood 1974; for Georgia, see Coleman 1978; and for Virginia, see Kulikoﬀ 1986.)
The duration of the initial, homestead phase – with an African demographic minority before the transition to the plantation economic system – is signiﬁcant in a second way. The longer the initial phase lasted, the larger became creole slave populations whose speech was targeted by those nonEuropeans who came during the plantation phase. The larger the proportion of creole people inherited from the homestead phase, the more transmitters there were of the local colonial koinés, hence the longer it took before the noncreole “seasoned” slaves became the majority of transmitters of the local vernacular. The longer it took the composition of the slave population to change in the above manner, the less extensively the local vernacular basilectalized. Recall that among the newcomers children typically acquired the local vernacular with only minimal deviations, if these were signiﬁcant at all. So, they contributed more to stabilizing it than to restructuring it under the inﬂuence of substrate languages. Had all strictly linguistic considerations been equal, the above factors alone would account for regional variation among creoles lexiﬁed by the same European languages.
Chaudenson (1992) invokes diﬀerences in the duration of the homestead societies to account for lack of Spanish creoles (qua systems associated with extensive restructuring of the lexiﬁer) in Latin America. For instance, Cuba remained for about 150 years in the homestead phase before getting into the sugar cane plantation industry. More intimate interracial relations, which account for the Hispanic ethnic phenomenon, also account for why Cuban Spanish has been treated as a closer analog of the white North American varieties of French and English than of the African-American varieties. The fact that during the long homestead phase Spanish missionaries engaged more in the Christianization of their slaves and taught them Castilian Spanish certainly bears on the fact that the restructuring of Spanish in Latin America has not proceeded along racial lines. In contrast,

64

The Founder Principle

French missionaries would later use the emerging creole to Christianize slaves in French colonies.
Places like Brazil make variation in the nature of interracial interaction a relevant factor. The more regularly or intimately Europeans and nonEuropeans interacted with each other during the formative periods of the colonial vernaculars, the less evidence there is for diverging ethnic varieties.
However, the overall situation was more complex. For example, the fact that a lot of French planters left Haiti from the beginning of the nineteenth century aﬀects the proposed parallelism between the relation of Réunionnais to Mauritian and that of Martiniquais to Haitian. Likewise, the fact that the British planters left Suriname while its English-lexicon creoles were still developing and being retained – despite the change in acrolectal language from English to Dutch – accounts in part for diﬀerences between these vernaculars and their counterparts in Anglophone territories.20 Thus every creole vernacular has to some extent a unique development history, despite similarities with other situations (Le Page and Tabouret-Keller 1985:23).
An important macro-level diﬀerence which the Founder Principle may also help explain is associated with the composition of non-European populations in diﬀerent colonies. As Ferraz (1979) and Maurer (1987) point out, some structural diﬀerences among Iberian creoles may be attributed to the composition of the slave populations during the critical stages of the development of these vernaculars. A case in point is the sentence-ﬁnal position of the negator in Principense, São Tomense, and Palenquero. It is apparently related to the heavier presence of Bantu speakers among those who developed these vernaculars. As in the case of Kituba and Lingala, which emerged out of the contact of primarily Bantu languages (Mufwene 1994b), those who developed these Iberian creoles selected a strategy patterned on the salient, free, sentence-ﬁnal negative correlative in several Bantu languages over the preverbal clitic marker.
The Founder Principle also helps determine what particular members of the founder population participated in, rather than simply witnessed, the development of the new vernaculars. This view suggests that speakers of the lexiﬁers must typically not have been passive by-standers with a role limited to making their language available for appropriation by nonEuropeans. Since the Europeans brought with them diverse metropolitan varieties, they accommodated each other and produced new colonial, koiné varieties. As already suggested by Schuchardt (1909) for Lingua Franca, the Europeans also accommodated non-Europeans and thus helped them restructure the lexiﬁer, though not necessarily in the way claimed by proponents of the Baby Talk hypothesis, such as Baissac (1880), Vinson (1882, 1888), and Adam (1883).

2.3 Evidence for the Founder Principle

65

The role of speakers of the lexiﬁer must also be seen in relation to the attitude of those holding political power. In this context, the Dutch colonies of Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles deserve a brief discussion. Regarding the Netherlands Antilles, it is unlikely that Papiamentu developed during the earlier rule of Curaçao by the Spaniards (1499/1527–1634). Three reasons particularly justify this inference: (i) no Atlantic creoles developed that early in time; (ii) very few creoles lexiﬁed by Spanish have developed in the New World, in great contrast with the large number of territories which the Spaniards colonized; and (iii) no plantations or big mines were exploited in Curaçao, which was initially a rest station. According to Goodman (1982:55), “very few slaves had been introduced [to Curaçao] before the fall of Brazil, perhaps not even before 1657.” Goodman (1982), Maurer (1988), and Holm (1989) all claim that Papiamentu developed during the Dutch rule (since 1634), which was marked by immigrations of Portuguese-speaking Dutch and their slaves from Brazil, from which they had been expelled by the Portuguese in 1654. Along with these populations came several Portuguese-speaking Sephardic Jews and their slaves. Bearing in mind that no major Portuguese Creole extensively restructured away from general Brazilian Portuguese has been documented, we can conjecture that a restructured Portuguese vernacular – perhaps corresponding to Chaudenson’s less restructured “approximation of the lexiﬁer” – was imported with these immigrants (especially with the slaves) to Curaçao. Having been adopted as the local vernacular, this ancestor of today’s Papiamentu must have been further restructured by new slaves brought from Africa – under conditions of rapid population replacement, as it was primarily a slave depot – and it seems to have been aﬀected in a diﬀerent way by increased trade with Spanish-speaking mainlanders of South America (Goodman 1982, Holm 1989). As in Suriname, the Dutch welcomed this new vernacular.
The linguistic parallelism between Curaçao and Suriname is enhanced by the development of Saramaccan, which contains a more prominent Portuguese element than, for example, Sranan, even though they both were lexiﬁed ﬁrst and primarily by English. Unlike Sranan, which has a stronger Dutch element, Saramaccan developed in the Surinamese interior, where most of the Portuguese Sephardic Jews ultimately coming from Brazil developed their plantations. Here in the interior, the Jews constituted three fourths of the white population in the late seventeenth century (Price 1976:37–8, cited by Goodman 1982:58). This situation favored retentions from their Portuguese-based vernacular. According to Goodman (1982:59), “the English Creole gradually supplanted the Portuguese inﬂuenced one on the plantations, but the latter survived among the Saramaccans.”21

66

The Founder Principle

Goodman’s hypothesis does not conﬂict with the assumption that, with the selection of restructured English as the vernacular among slaves in the Dutch colony (a conﬁrmation of the Founder Principle), the coexistence of English-speaking and Portuguese-speaking slaves on several plantations led variably to the Saramaccan phenomenon. Because speakers of restructured Portuguese were demographically signiﬁcant in Suriname’s interior, the presence of the Portuguese element was bound to be more evident there. On the other hand, in Paramaribo and on the coast, where there were more Dutch speakers, the Dutch element became more conspicuous in Sranan. Contrary to several claims in the literature, maroonage may thus not be a primary sociohistorical factor in the development of Saramaccan, although it may have fostered further basilectalization. The early departure of native speakers of the lexiﬁer was in itself signiﬁcant enough to account for why basilectal Saramaccan is the most diﬀerent from English of all the English creoles. Discontinued supply of native speakers and rapid inﬂux of non-English speakers combined to favor more sub- and adstrate inﬂuence from the other languages that the early Surinamese colonial English koiné came in contact with.
The situation in the Dutch colonies must have been favored by the Dutch disposition to adopt the local lingua franca where one was already developing or had already developed. This conclusion is contrary to the claim that the Dutch deliberately kept their vernacular as “a ‘caste’ language which slaves were not allowed to know” (Voorhoeve 1964:236, quoted by Holm 1989:435; see also Holm 1989:313). Even though there may be partial justiﬁcation for this claim, note that where the Dutch were involved in the original contacts, as in the Virgin Islands and on the Berbice River (in today’s Guyana), Dutch creoles did develop, viz., Negerhollands in the former and Berbice Dutch in the latter.
The case of Berbice brings up additional supportive evidence for the Founder Principle. According to Robertson (1993:300), the Ijos constituted the dominant African majority in the Berbice colony during the second half of the eighteenth century. Their incontrovertible inﬂuence on Berbice Dutch lies in several structural features, such as tense suﬃxes, sentenceﬁnal negative markers, and postpositions. This is one of the rare cases among creoles where substrate inﬂuence is evident even in the form of grammatical morphemes not selected from the lexiﬁer. (For more information see Kouwenberg 1994.)
Louisiana Creole also turns up as an interesting illustration of the Founder Principle considered ethnographically. The French colonization of Louisiana, which then included plantations at and near the Mississippi River Delta, as well as trade posts in a corridor that extended from the Delta to the Canadian border and between the Appalachian and the Rocky

2.3 Evidence for the Founder Principle

67

Mountains (excluding Texas), was interrupted by four decades of Spanish rule (at least in its southern, coastal part). The Spanish rule lasted from 1769 to 1803, after which the French sold the colony to the Americans. However, in parts of present-day Louisiana colonial French and the creole then developing from it were maintained as the primary local vernaculars, which continued to be spoken long after the “Louisiana Purchase” (1803). The development of AAVE in the area did not amount to a relexiﬁcation of the restructured French varieties spoken before English replaced French as the oﬃcial language and as the vernacular spoken by large proportions of subsequent immigrants and their descendants. Thus, in present-day Louisiana changes in political and economic realities have been slow to aﬀect the legacy of the founder populations. To date, the state continues to bear French cultural elements. Similar observations may be made about the survival of French creoles in Dominica, St. Lucia, and Trinidad, although there is ecological variation which explains some diﬀerences in the ways these vernaculars have survived.

2.3.2 Structural considerations
At the structural level, an apparent counter-argument to the Founder Principle might be misconstrued from the fact that creoles share several morphosyntactic features with each other. Although the features do not single them out as a typological or genetic group apart from other languages, pace McWhorter (1998), this condition has indeed prompted the competing genetic explanations that were summarized in section 2.2.1. The Founder Principle is of course not intended to replace any of these hypotheses. The best of substratist and superstratist accounts for features of individual creoles can coexist happily, assuming at the same time that the language bioprogram qua Universal Grammar is the body of principles which, like a ﬁlter, have regulated how elements from the diﬀerent language varieties in contact got selected and recombined into these new vernaculars’ systems. This chapter is intended to enrich this basic position of the socalled complementary hypothesis.
To reiterate my thesis, several, if not most, of the deeply entrenched features of creoles’ structures originate in the founder populations’ linguistic peculiarities. A useful starting point is the makeup of the lexiﬁer, which typically consisted of a set-theory union of diverse nonstandard dialects which may not even have coexisted locally or regionally in the metropolis. Diﬀerent subsets of these varieties were represented on the same plantations in the colonies and developed into local koinés. A concomitant of the situation with the lexiﬁer is the mixed ethnolinguistic makeup of the slave population during the critical stage(s) of the formation of a creole.

68

The Founder Principle

Together, all the colonial varieties of the lexiﬁer and the diverse languages spoken by the slaves constituted new, disjunctive pools of features competing for selection into the developing creoles’ systems, on the model of gene pools in biology, as explained in chapter 1.
Making allowance for exaptations, I argue that with regard to form or distribution of morphemes, there are scant features of creoles that did not have (partial) models in the language varieties represented in the contact settings. As shown in section 2.2.5, after a form or construction was selected into the emerging system, there was room for exaptive innovations. Thus the development of creoles’ grammatical patterns can be related to various processes of grammaticization. I show below that several of the morphosyntactic strategies invoked to support diverse positions on the development of creoles are intimately connected to the Founder Principle.

2.3.2.1 Serial Verb Constructions (SVCs) in Atlantic creoles are a convenient starting point. Substratists have used the presence of SVCs in several African languages, especially those of the Kwa group, in contrast with the rarity of SVCs in European languages, to argue that creoles owe the constructions to substrate inﬂuence. The signiﬁcant demographic presence of Kwa speakers in several plantation colonies during the critical periods of the development of the new vernaculars has been used to justify this genetic position. In some cases, more speciﬁc claims for the dominant inﬂuence of particular groups have been made, for instance, for Fongbe inﬂuence in Haitian Creole (e.g., Lefebvre 1993, 1998) and for Twi inﬂuence in Jamaican Creole (Alleyne 1993).
On the other hand, advocates of the language bioprogram hypothesis have invoked absence of such constructions in, for instance, the Bantu languages – whose speakers were in proportions higher than, or (almost) equal to, those of Kwa languages on some plantations – to argue that SVCs in creoles must have been innovated by children. They argue that if a construction was not shared by all African languages in the contact setting, there was more room for the bioprogram to kick in and produce this allegedly more basic and less marked structural alternative, relative to options speciﬁed in Universal Grammar.
All the above positions call for some corrections, especially if a close correlation is held to exist between changes in external ecological conditions and the restructuring of the lexiﬁer which resulted in the creoles. The “matériaux de construction” involved in the restructuring were present in the founder populations’ speech. As far as English creoles are concerned, colloquial English has serial-like constructions such as in let’s go get the book and every day I come get the paper (Pullum 1990). Although these are restricted to combinations with go or come as heads and to base forms, they

2.3 Evidence for the Founder Principle

69

are frequent enough to consider their presence in the nonstandard lexiﬁers of creoles relevant to the development of SVCs.
Regarding French creoles, we should not take too rigidly Seuren’s (1990) observation that SVCs are not attested in French and should not be confused with constructions with inﬁnitival complements, such as va chercher ton couteau “go get your cutlass,” which he prefers to call “pseudocomplements.” The French constructions share some superﬁcial similarity with SVCs in terms of Verb + Verb sequences, just as do English constructions such as go ﬁshing, which Seuren and most creolists justiﬁably rule out from the category of SVCs. However, what matters is not the status of such constructions in the lexiﬁers, but how they were analysed by those who targeted them. As inﬂections were generally not selected into the creoles’ systems, the distinction between SVCs and pseudocomplements was likely to turn into a moot matter of details that were insigniﬁcant to speakers of the new vernaculars.
Regarding the Bantu languages, it is not accurate to ﬂatly deny the existence of SVCs in them. Varieties of ethnic Kikongo have serial-like constructions in the historical present, which have survived in the narrative tense in Kituba (Mufwene 1988:41), as illustrated below:

(1)

a Kikongo:

María ú+bák+a mbeele, ú+lwek+a bákála di+ándi

Mary +take+ cutlass +cut+ husband +her22

A. “Mary took a cutlass and hit her husband.”

B. “Mary hit her husband with a cutlass.”

b. Kituba:

María báka mbelé búla yakála na yándi.

Mary take cutlass hit husband  her

A. “Mary took a cutlass and hit her husband.”

B. “Mary hit her husband with a machete.”

Thus, almost all the language varieties in contact seem to have conspired to favor the selection and variable development of SVCs in Atlantic and other creoles. Speakers apparently selected options that were identiﬁed as less marked for any number of reasons, including crosslinguistic congruence, semantic transparency, salience, and frequency. More or less the same factors seem to have favored the development of SVCs, not ex nihilo, in Kituba as in Atlantic creoles. While factors can be used to argue that the role of Universal Grammar should not be overlooked in the development of creoles, the point of invoking the Founder Principle here is to show that for whatever reason SVCs became so prominent in creoles’ systems (unlike in AAVE), there was no scarcity of models in the language varieties that came into contact in the settings in which they developed. No children need be invoked as a deus ex machina to account for the presence of this syntactic

The Founder Principle

construction in almost all creoles. The role of Universal Grammar in this particular case may have been limited to constraining the selection of particular grammatical strategies.23
The relation between creoles’ SVCs and their possible sources is complicated by constructions in which a serial verb meaning “give” alternates with, or is used instead of, a dative prepositional construction. This serial pattern, which is used only in some creoles (such as Haitian and Saramaccan), is not attested in the European lexiﬁers; nor is it used in all serializing African languages. Such variation underscores the need to examine the development of every creole separately, in its speciﬁc contact ecology. Of course this ecology need not be completely isolated from similar developments elsewhere; I advocate paying attention to similarities and diﬀerences alike.

2.3.2.2 The structure of negative constructions is another interesting structural feature. In all the relevant creoles, neither the form of the negator(s) nor its/their position is novel. In the case of Atlantic English creoles, the negator and its position are generally from the lexiﬁer, selected undoubtedly with the conspiracy of the pre-predicate position of the negator in several African languages. Note that although several Bantu languages of the Congo-Angola region have a free clause-ﬁnal negative marker, many of them also have a negative verbal preﬁx, which co-occurs with the former but may also be used alone (i.e., without the sentence-ﬁnal correlate) in some languages. Although the dynamics of the developments of Kituba and Lingala out of the contact of primarily Bantu languages favored the selection of a free clause-ﬁnal negative morpheme, nothing would have made it too diﬃcult for speakers of such languages to adjust to one single pre-predicate negator during the development of the English (and French) creoles’ systems. With regard to Bantu speakers, it appears that diﬀerent ecologies led to diﬀerent selections out of the preverbal and sentence-ﬁnal alternatives.
The particular selections made into English creoles regarding form and position underscore the signiﬁcance of what forms and strategies were competing in the lexiﬁer. All the creoles’ negators, viz., no, don [dõ], ain [˜ε], and neba “never,” are from English. The main diﬀerence is that in the creoles these negators have syntactic distributions and semantic functions which are sometimes not identical with those of their etyma. For instance, no is no longer limited to noun phrases (narrow scope) or to elliptical/anaphoric contexts in which the speaker chooses not to repeat the whole sentence. It also occurs freely before the predicate in Caribbean English creoles, as in im no (ben) kom “he/she did not come.” In Gullah, ain is used

2.3 Evidence for the Founder Principle

71

not just before nonverbal predicates and as an alternative to have not/do not have but also in completive constructions, before a verb stem, as in he ain come “he/she has/did not come.” Likewise, don typically functions as a  negator, as in he don come “he does not come,” in addition to where it is used in other varieties of English. Even these new uses show undeniable connections to the lexiﬁer, as ain also alternates with hasn’t and haven’t in some British nonstandard dialects (Cheshire 1991) and may very well have been extended from hasn’t/haven’t come, given the time-reference ambiguity of the  construction (Tagliamonte 1996). Likewise, do not is  with nonstative verbs in almost all English dialects. The challenging questions are: why are these particular selections made and why do they vary from creole to creole?
Note that with regard to selecting from competing strategies in the lexiﬁer, the situation in Kituba, Lingala, and English is not so diﬀerent from that of French creoles, even though French oﬀers a seemingly variable system in which the more common negator pas of colloquial French (typically used without ne) follows ﬁnite and present participial verbs but pre cedes inﬁnitival and past participial verbs, for example, je (ne) viens pas “I am not coming” and ne travaillant pas “not working” vs. pas ﬁni “not ﬁnished” and elle (ne) peut pas venir “she cannot come” (Mufwene 1991c). The regularization of its pre-predicate position in French creoles is obviously not entirely independent of French itself (Hazaël-Massieux 1993; Spears 1993), although the congruent inﬂuences of several African languages following this pattern must be acknowledged. Loss of inﬂections and selection of verbal forms which are not clearly distinct from the inﬁnitive and the past participle seem consistent with the selected preverbal position of the negator pa in creoles. Not only did the morpheme for negation come from the lexiﬁer but so did the model for its syntactic distribution. Even forms that might appear to be exceptional may be traced to French, e.g., te pas la (formerly a variant of the today’s regularized pa te la) “was not there” and ve pa “don’t want” are frozen retentions from (n’)était pas là and veux pas with the same meanings (Hazaël-Massieux 1993). (For more details on how negation works in Haitian Creole and may have developed, see DeGraﬀ 1993.)
On the other hand, São Tomense and Palenquero (discussed above) followed the Kituba and Lingala option under ecological conditions of dominant Bantu inﬂuence (Ferraz 1979; Maurer 1987), contrary to the preverbal position of the negator in other Iberian creoles. These facts converge with those of French creoles in suggesting that speciﬁc ethnographic and linguistic dynamics of the founder populations more or less determined the directions of the restructuring of the lexiﬁers into diverse creoles.

72

The Founder Principle

2.3.2.3 The role of the / distinction in the noun phrase of most creoles (Bickerton 1981, 1984; Mufwene 1981, 1986c; Dijkhoﬀ 1983) has been invoked to support the language bioprogram hypothesis (Bickerton 1981, 1984).24 Taken together with the absence of (deﬁnite) articles and the phrase-ﬁnal position of the deictic marker la in Haitian and other French creoles, this delimitative system has been adduced also to support African substrate inﬂuence (Alleyne 1980). However, a closer examination of facts reveals that the I N D I V I D U AT E D / N O N I N D I V I D U AT E D distinction is inherent in both English and French, as well as several other languages. English has constructions such as go to church, beware of falling rock, and boy meets girl, which are relevant to the selection of nonindividuated noun phrases in creoles for  uses of nouns and for  reference. This may be doubly illustrated with the Jamaican Creole proverb daag no nyam daag “[a] dog1 does not eat dog2 [meat]” (       1 . . .     2).
As diﬀerent as it may seem from English in this respect, French also has constructions which may have inﬂuenced the development of an I N D I V I D U AT E D / N O N I N D I V I D U AT E D system in the creoles it lexiﬁed. Constructions such as crime de passion “crime of passion” and avoir faim “be hungry,” in which the object of the preposition or verb is nonindividuated and used without an article, are relevant. Valli (1994) uncovers inconsistencies in the uses and omissions of articles in ﬁfteenth-century French texts, as shown below, a practice that he justiﬁably suspects may have occurred in colonial French:

(2)

a. Les princes ont charge politique.

“The princes are in charge of politics.”

b. . . . Dieu vous y a deja donné bon commencement

“. . . God has already given you a good start”

All the above facts highlight the role of the founder population’s language in the development of creoles’ systems. Facts on French creoles’ deictic marker la speak even louder in support of this position. This marker is extensively used in nonstandard French, making the deﬁnite article superﬂuous in constructions such as l’homme là “the/that man.” It is also more salient, being normally stressed in its phrase-ﬁnal position. In addition, hardly any African languages have an article system. They mark deﬁniteness by extending the use of a distal demonstrative to this function. At least among the Bantu languages, the marker typically has a phrase-ﬁnal position, like the distal demonstrative là in French. All these factors conspired to favor the selection of French NP-ﬁnal là over the deﬁnite article as a marker of deﬁniteness in Haitian Creole.

2.3 Evidence for the Founder Principle

73

Again, features of the founder populations’ linguistic systems determined the alternatives selected into the relevant creoles’ structures. Innovations ex nihilo are an exaggerated account, whereas innovations as traditionally invoked in historical linguistics are consistent with the Founder Principle.

2.3.2.4 The  / distinction, which is useful in explaining the diﬀering interpretations of predicates used in the  and  – as in im come “he came/he has come” and im laik ﬁ/fu/fə sing “he/she likes to sing” in English creoles – has also often been invoked to support the language bioprogram hypothesis. The typical reason invoked is that in the lexiﬁers and several substrate languages the interpretation of time reference does not depend as much on this lexical aspect (Aktionsart) opposition.
Such an observation is unfortunately not so accurate regarding the lexiﬁers. For instance, in English, the temporal interpretation of Paul likes wrestling is not the same as that of Paul works here; the diﬀerence follows from the fact that like is a stative verb, whereas work is nonstative. The same is true of the French translations Paul aime la lutte and Paul travaille ici. The main diﬀerence between the relevant constructions in these languages and their counterparts in the creoles they lexiﬁed lies in the preferred interpretation of the constructions in the absence of adverbials. In an English creole im come “he/she came” or “he/she has come” is typically assigned a   interpretation (referring to the past) in such cases, whereas im laik “he/she likes” receives a  interpretation (typically referring to the present).
If we take the general absence of inﬂections in creoles into account, things fall out neatly, consistent with a distinction which is available in the lexiﬁers, even in the case of French creoles. In most of the language varieties that came into contact (with the exception of standard French, if it is at all relevant), a nonstative verb must be in the  in order to refer to the present. The construction être après de + Inﬁnitive was attested in nonstandard French for basically the same  function as its adaptation ap(e) + Verb Stem serves in French creoles. Such a requirement for morphosyntactic delimitation does not hold for stative verbs. Since nonstative verbs are typically used with an aspectual marker to refer to the present, bare verbal forms are interpreted as referring to the past. Common usage of the   in spoken language may very well have been an important factor. The application of a similar grammatical system in several West-African (not just Kwa) languages would have favored selection of nonstative verb stems, over other alternatives, for completive reference.

74

The Founder Principle

This development is diﬀerent from, for instance, Kituba (Mufwene 1990b) and Lingala because the latter vernaculars developed in ethnographic ecologies in which they were bound to be heavily inﬂuenced by Bantu morphosyntax.
Thus, much of what was innovated in Atlantic and Indian Ocean creoles was inspired by several of the languages spoken by the populations in contact, including the lexiﬁers, during the critical periods of their developments. Since Bantu-speakers were likely to exert a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the development of Mauritian (Baker 1994; Corne 1999), it appears that the lexiﬁers themselves played a greater role in the development of creoles than is often suggested in the literature. A convenient example may be cited from the fusion of articles with nouns in Mauritian, though less extensively in other creoles, as discussed by Baker (1984, 1994). For instance, the partitive French article du – unrounded to [di] among nonnative speakers – has been fused with blé “wheat” in diblé “wheat,” with the consequence of preventing homophony with blé from bleu “blue” (also produced as [ble] among non-native speakers). The new forms are clearly patterned from forms/constructions which occur in French, which can also be observed in such a Mauritian item as zanfan “child,” which has kept only the end of the deﬁnite article in les enfants [lεzãfã] “children.” This explanation does not necessarily contradict Baker’s (1984, 1994) invocation of Bantu inﬂuence in the selection of this particular solution, given the existence of agglutination in the Bantu languages. The only problem is that one would have expected Bantu speakers to be more attentive to form variation and be able to identify the stems. It is also debatable whether speakers deliberately prevented the proliferation of homophones in Mauritian Creole by fusing articles and nouns into new lexical items. However, the result is undeniable. Other examples, among many, include the following:

(3)

Fusion of Article + Noun in Mauritian

lari “street” (< la rue [laRü]) vs. diri “rice” (< du riz [düRi])

lavi “life” (< la vie [lavi]) vs. vi “sight, view” (la vue [lavü])

laser [lasεr] “ﬂesh” (< la chair [lasˇεR]) vs. ser [sεr] “sister” (la soeur

[lasœR]).25

Still, the “matériaux de construction” came from French itself, in which the article and the noun or nominal it modiﬁes are typically pronounced as one phonological word.

2.3.2.5 Generally, most grammatical features of a creole can be explained in the way sketched above, which is essentially in the traditional spirit of historical linguistics taken to intersect with language contact. In many ways, the features are not faithful copies of their etyma or models. They

2.4 Conclusions

75

involve exaptations to new functions, as happens in the evolutions of other languages too. There is really no particular reason why the developments of creoles should not be treated as consequences of normal linguistic interactions in speciﬁc ecological conditions of linguistic contacts involving not only speakers (as in any monolingual speech community) but also diﬀerent language varieties. Creoles should prompt us to rethink some established assumptions about language change and the role of ecology.

2.4 Conclusions
The Founder Principle is not a hypothesis on the development of creoles in the same way that the universalist, substrate, superstrate, and complementary hypotheses have been claimed to be. Like the markedness model that I have often invoked in this discussion, it is one of several principles that must be considered as we try to account for the development of creole vernaculars.
One of the ﬂaws of genetic creolistics lies in the all-too-common comparison of creoles’ structural features with those of the standard varieties of their lexiﬁers. The social histories of the relevant colonies suggest that the varieties to which the makers of creoles were exposed and which they restructured were nonstandard. Thus it is with them that comparisons must be made to develop an adequate picture of what was restructured and how.
I have also argued that several structural features of creoles’ systems are not the kinds of innovations claimed by the language bioprogram hypothesis, though they involve exaptive innovations. Many such innovations have been extended from strategies which were already available in the lexiﬁer. Others have originated in some of the language varieties with which the lexiﬁer came into contact and whose features competed with its own during the development of the new vernacular. Structural congruence (often only partial) between the lexiﬁer and the substrate languages was often an important factor, but it may not have applied in all cases nor independently of other factors. In emphasizing that models of many of creoles’ structural features were attested in the speech of the founder populations, the Founder Principle shows that the development of creoles may be explained with the same kinds of principles generally invoked in historical linguistics. We simply must interpret every set of restructuring processes that resulted in a creole within the relevant sociohistorical ecology.
The focus on the founder population, when European colonists still interacted regularly with the non-European laborers, also makes it inaccurate to invoke a break in the transmission of the lexiﬁer as a reason for the restructuring of the latter into a creole. After the creole non-Europeans appropriated the lexiﬁer in basically the same form as the European colonists did

76

The Founder Principle

(viz., a colonial koiné), they functioned as the linguistic models for the nonEuropeans who arrived later in the colonies. There was thus no time when the lexiﬁer was not normally transmitted from one group to another, even as it was restructured in the process. We should ask ourselves whether there are cases when a language is not restructured even minimally while it is acquired by another group or generation of speakers. Even language transmission through the scholastic medium has not prevented restructuring, as discussed in chapter 4.
The Founder Principle does not preclude later inﬂuence as the ethnographic conditions of the contact setting changed during the gradual and protracted development of the new vernacular, especially during its basilectalization phase. However, during this process, features of the founder variety often had selective advantage. A partial explanation is that populations did not double or triple overnight; growth was achieved by installments, each of which generally brought a group which was a minority relative to the local creole and the already seasoned slave population. Under such circumstances, it must have been more cost-eﬀective to try to speak the local vernacular as such, even if not so successfully, rather than to try to modify or replace it. This caused the founder population’s features to be more and more entrenched within the language community.
Admittedly, in situations such as the development of Saramaccan, the new group consisting of slaves speaking (restructured) colonial Portuguese varieties did signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the development of what had started from an English lexiﬁer. However, such situations are uncommon and correspond to massive inﬂuxes of newcomers including new managers of the economic system (e.g., the Shephardic Jews who brought slaves from Brazil). All this happened also thanks to a transition from English to Dutch domination during which the system left behind by the English colonists was both inherited and modiﬁed. The adoption of the English-based lingua franca itself is evidence for the Founder Principle.
The Founder Principle can also be invoked to explain the retention of French creoles in territories that the French colonial system lost, e.g., Mauritius, Dominica, and St. Lucia: the extant local vernacular just prevailed. Likewise, it accounts for the survival of a French creole in Trinidad, though an interpretation more sensitive to the beginning of the British colonial regime is required here to make sense of the process. According to Holm (1989), there was massive immigration of planters and their slaves from neighboring francophone islands in 1763. One wonders whether the francophones were not integrated with the anglophones, at least for a signiﬁcant while.
It should also be emphasized that structural features need not have been selected into a creole with their forms or functions preserved intact

2.4 Conclusions

77

(Boretzky 1993). Chaudenson’s trope of “matériau de construction” is particularly apt because it does not preclude alterations for the purposes of meeting communicative needs in the new vernacular. For instance, loss of the copula in several syntactic environments and of inﬂections in the emerging creoles was bound to aﬀect the selection of some constructions from the lexiﬁers for tense and aspect. Thus French être après de + Inﬁnitive was adapted to the copula-less ap(e) + Verb Stem in Haitian Creole.
Regarding function, the reinterpretation of the / distinction is noteworthy. As habits are typically expressed with either speciﬁc adverbials or special preverbal markers, the distinction has been reassigned to interpreting time reference for predicates in the absence of inﬂections and any other indicators of time. In the domain of nominal number, the absence of an   in most of these new vernaculars has caused  to subsume  reference too. Other noteworthy developments include the clause-introducer sε (< English say) in English creoles, which, while retaining its quotative function, has also acquired a complementizer function (Mufwene 1989a, 1996a). Likewise, based on (partial) models in English itself, the morpheme ﬁ/fu/fə (< for) has not only retained its basic function as a preposition, but also developed modal and complementizer functions (Mufwene 1989a, 1996a). The models include constructions such as I’d like for John to come (with the complementizer to generally dispensed with) and this is for you/cleaning up (with the copula and the gerund -ing marker also omitted in the emergent vernacular). The same principles which apply in the context of grammaticization to exapting uses of extant constructions and making them consistent with the rules of the extant grammar appear to have also applied in the development of creoles. As noted above, the development of each creole seems to have involved several concurrent restructuring processes, with a number of them conspiring to produce new grammatical peculiarities.
Whether or not creoles are treated as dialects of their lexiﬁers – an issue that is highly political – the structures of these vernaculars can be interpreted as having resulted in part from several concurrent processes of grammaticization. The whole evolutionary trajectory from the lexiﬁer to speciﬁc creoles was continuous. Grammaticization is of course not the full story, since other evolutionary processes took place, starting with the simple selection and reintegration into one system of forms, structures, and principles which did not use to form one system even in the lexiﬁer itself. Sylvain (1936), which could well be interpreted as one of the best defenses for combined superstrate and substrate inﬂuence, shows clearly how many diverse varieties of nonstandard French were the sources of several of Haitian Creole’s forms and structures. For instance, Sylvain relates kisˇoy

78

The Founder Principle

“something” to Norman qui chose [ki sˇoz] (p. 53); yo “they, them” directly to Gascony and Auvergne yo rather than the standard French eux “they, them” (p. 65); yõ “one” to Norman yon (p. 74); the anterior marker te to Picardy té (past participle of être “be”) (p. 138); and the  marker ﬁn to similar uses of ﬁni in central France dialects (p. 139). Much remains to be understood about the principles which, at least at the communal level, permitted such diverse sources to contribute to the development of the new vernacular.
Unfortunately, the above kind of explanation has been hurriedly dismissed by misinvoking the Cafeteria Principle. Yet, there is no empirical evidence for the tacit assumption that a language is transmitted wholesale from one group of speakers to another. Even children acquire it piecemeal, unpacking it and recreating it with variable degrees of success. Since linguistic contact (at the level of idiolect, dialect, or language) takes place in the minds of individual speakers and there is no reason why the coexistent systems must be kept (neatly) apart, there is no particular reason why “matériaux de construction” cannot have been selected from diﬀerent sources initially for the purposes of establishing successful communication, with the unplanned result of producing a new language variety. Nettle (1999:5) apparently espouses the same view in observing that “Languages are not phylogenetically homogeneous units; instead their traits often derive from multiple sources in a way that depends on the origin and cultural aﬃliation of their speakers.” The literature on code-mixing suggests that this should be part of normal evolution. What we have always needed to account for the development of creoles is a set of principles that account for how competing forms and constructions have been selected into the new vernaculars.
I have proposed the Founder Principle, like the ecology-based model of markedness, to articulate more explicitly what is involved in the development of creoles according to the complementary hypothesis as characterized in section 2.2.1. In my version of this position, substrate and superstrate elements are the only ones involved in the competition of features, especially as far as structural principles are concerned. The language bioprogram qua Universal Grammar functions as a body of principles regulating the selection of features into creoles’ systems, like into those of noncreole language varieties. Much remains to be articulated about the nature of Universal Grammar itself, including the selection principles I have been alluding to.
The status of the markedness principles in Universal Grammar is discussed in Mufwene (1991a). There I argue that markedness values are determined relative to the ecology of restructuring by diverse factors which sometimes yield diﬀerent selections in diﬀerent contact settings. Sometimes

the factors also conﬂict naturally with each other in the same ecology. In such cases the more heavily weighted factor may prevail; but the competing alternatives may also be retained, producing normal variation in the system. Neither the weighting nor the values are determined in Universal Grammar, although the factors determining the values may be identiﬁable by it. The Founder Principle is likewise an ecological factor external to Universal Grammar, but it works concurrently with it in constraining the restructuring which results in a creole or any other restructured language variety. In relation to the complementary hypothesis, the Founder Principle helps deﬁne the pool of competing features from among which a subset is selected into a creole’s system.
In this context, we may also examine the question of whether restructured varieties of European languages previously spoken in Africa, e.g., Guinea Coast Creole English (GCCE), may have served as the basis from which English Atlantic creoles of the New World would have been developed (Hancock 1980; McWhorter 1995, 1998). Several questions arise which can be formulated but not answered here. First, what was the form of GCCE? Second, were its speakers among the founder populations of English colonies? Third, what proportion did they represent of subsequent populations during the basilectalization phase of the creoles? Fourth, did GCCE have any chance of being preserved during the homestead phase of the development of the colonies?
If one could speak of perfect language acquisition at all, let alone of perfect second language acquisition among adults, patterns of interaction during the homestead phase could have favored such linguistic developments. However, although discrimination existed, it was less race-based and not compounded with segregation. There is no evidence that non-European non-native speakers of the lexiﬁer had less linguistic success than European non-native speakers under the same ethnographic conditions. One must wait until the eighteenth century for suggestions that non-Europeans spoke the colonial lingua franca diﬀerently. Further, such divergent speech is usually associated with slaves who were born in, or had recently arrived from, Africa. Otherwise, the silence on language can be interpreted to suggest that during the homestead phase non-Europeans did not speak the colonial lingua franca diﬀerently from European speakers, matching locally born with locally born and nonnative speakers with nonnative speakers in each case. Sometimes one comes across explicit references to Africans speaking the lingua franca well, such as the observation by Father Labbat cited earlier and the following from Kulikoﬀ (1986:317) who quotes Jones (1724) as saying that “slaves born in Virginia ‘talk good English, and aﬀect our language, habits, and customs’” (1956 edition, pp. 75–6). The creole non-white children certainly spoke the same colonial (koiné) varieties of the

lexiﬁers as the creole white children did and they became the models for subsequent immigrants, especially after segregation was institutionalized.
So, are there any particular ethnographic reasons why GCCE would have prevailed as a founder variety and would have inﬂuenced the development of particular creoles? We can refer this question to Le Page and TabouretKeller’s (1985:26) position that the development of most creoles could not escape the inﬂuence of previous lingua francas used before the development of New World communities and the like. However, like Rickford (1987), I ﬁnd no evidence in the history of the slave trade that suggests that even a signiﬁcant proportion of slaves imported from Africa during the seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries would have been familiar with GCCE. It is not even clear how widespread this variety was during that time. Huber (1999) argues that it was not and that Portuguese was more commonly used as a trade language in the region.
The Founder Principle thus oﬀers us some ways of addressing in an enlightening fashion this important genetic question about whether GCCE played a central role in the development of Atlantic creoles. Similar questions could be raised about the role of varieties used in contacts between the Indians and the Europeans in the New World before the Africans became the primary component of the labor populations (Emmanuel Drechsel, p.c. October 1994; Baker 1996). History suggests that the role of pidgins used in European–Native American interactions would be negligible, primarily because those contact varieties were typically based on Native American languages, not on European languages (Goddard 1997; Buccini 1999). A second reason is that colonial communities during the homestead phase developed on concessions in which the Africans and Europeans lived more intimately with each other than with the Native Americans with whom some of them traded. The Africans need not have depended on Native Americans to appropriate the language varieties spoken by the Europeans.
To close, the Founder Principle oﬀers a useful perspective from which we may address various, though not all, aspects of the complex question of the development of creoles as mixed languages, with features coming from diverse sources and possibly at diﬀerent stages of their gradual and protracted development. It enriches the complementary hypothesis by providing it more solid grounding in the socioeconomic history of the development of creoles and by directing attention to speciﬁc critical periods, even if these may not literally involve founder populations.
