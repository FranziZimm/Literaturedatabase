PREFACE
The aim of the present book is to provide an introduction to verbal aspect and related concepts. It differs from most other books on aspect in that it is not concerned with any one parti.cular language, nor with a comparison of various individual languages, but rather presents aspect as a part of general linguistic theory. Theoretical points are, of course, illustrated throu ghout with examples from various languages : English, as the language that all readers of the book will have in common ; Russian and other Slavonic languages, in view of the importance of data from these languages in the development of the study of aspect, and also as these are the foreign languages most familiar to the author ; the Romance languages (in particular, French and Spanish); as well as a variety of other languages, ranging from Greek to Chinese. References are made throughout to descriptive works dealing with the various languages alluded to.
The book does not presuppose any previous knowledge of aspect, although it does assume that the reader has the sort of background that can be expected of someone who has followed an introductory course in general linguistics, or is following such a course, and is prepared to consult other textbooks and reference works for further details of general theoretical points. It does not attempt to put across any one particular current approach to the problem of aspect, although it does aim at internal consistency, nor does it provide a historical resume of the various approaches that have been proposed. Most of the discussion is cast in the general terms of traditional grammar, paying particular attention to the semantics of aspect. In addition, attention is paid to some of the achievements of the structuralist approach to aspect (especially chapter 6 on markedness), and of the philosophical approach (especially chapter 2 on aspect and inherent meaning). An appendix (appendix B) outlines three recent approaches to the

analysis of aspect, to give the reader some idea of current work in this field.
I shall consider the purpose of this book to be fulfilled if it gives its readers a greater awareness of the problem of aspect, and conveys to them the general concepts concerned, even more so if they then go on to apply this knowledge in their work on the languages that particularly interest them.
I am grateful to the following, who either provided me with bibl io­ graphic references, volunteered information about the aspectual systems of various languages, answered my more specific questions, or discussed general and specific problems of aspect with me : G. M. Awbery, W. S. AlIen, E. W. Browne, M. Harris, M. Ivic, and J. Miller. I am particularly grateful to J. Lyons, who read an earlier draft of this book and made detailed comments on it. The responsibility for accepting or rejecting their suggestions is, of course, my own.
Part of the preparation of this book was carried out while I was a Research Fellow at King's College, Cambridge.

Introduction
O. I. Definition of aspect Since the term ' aspect ' tends to be less familiar to students
of linguistics than are terms for the other verbal categories such as tense or mood, it is as well, before giving a definition of aspect, to consider some examples of aspectual distinctions in languages likely to
be familiar to readers, in order to provide some factual material against which it will be possible to view the more theoretical part of the dis­ CUSSlOn.
Students of Russian and other Slavonic languages are familiar with the distinction between Perfective and Imperfective aspect, as in on
proc ital (Pfv.) and on cital (Ipfv.), both translatable into English as 'he
read', although some idea of the difference can be given by translating
the Imperfective as ' he was reading, he used to read ' ; this is only an
approximate characterisation, and a more detailed discussion will be found in the body of the book. In fact, the distinction between he read, he was read ing, and he used to read in English is equally an aspectual distinction, so aspect is a category even in as familiar a language as English. Similarly in the Romance languages, the difference between, for instance, French illut and illisait, Spanish ley6 and (el) leia, Italian lesse and leggeva, is one of aspect, despite the traditional terminology,
which speaks of the Imperfect (lisait, leia, leggeva) as a tense, and equally
of the Simple Past (lut, ley6, lesse), also called the Past Definite, Historic, or Remote, as a tense.l
Particularly in view of this terminological, and conceptual, confusion
of tense and aspect, it is worth ensuring now that the meaning of the
more familiar term 'tense' is understood, before embarking on discus­ sion of the less familiar term C aspect '. Tense relates the time of the

speaking of the Romance past tense forms is suggested in section S.1.2.

Introduction

situation referred to to some other time, usually to the moment of sp eaking. l The commonest tenses found in languages - though not all languages distinguish these three tenses, or indeed distinguish tense at all - arc present, past, and future : a situation described in the present ten se is located temporally as simultaneous with the moment of speaking (e.g. John is singing); one described in the past as located prior to the moment of spea kin g (e.g. John sang, John was singing); one described in the future as located subsequ ent to the moment of speaking (e.g. John will sing, John will be singing).2 Since tense locates the time of a situation relati ve to the situation of the utterance, we may describe tense as d eictic. 3
The tenses referred to so far have all related the time of the situation described to the present moment. Such tenses are referred to as absolute tenses. Another possible form of time reference is relative time reference where, instead of the time of a situation being located relative to th� present moment, it is related to the time of some other situation. Nonfinite participial constructions in English, for instance, involve relative rather than absolute tense. In the sentences (a) when walking down the road, I often meet Harry and (b) when walking down the road, I often met Harry, the present participle walking in both cases indicates a situation located simultaneous with the time of the main verb, irrespec­ t ive of the tense of the main verb. In the (a) sentence, the situation described by walking holds at the present, given the present tense meet, while in the (b) sentence it held in the past, given the past tense met i the relevant factor in the choice of the present participle is thus relative time reference, not absolute time reference. Similarly, the so-called perfect participle in such nonfinite participial constructions indicates relative past time reference, e.g. having met Harry earlier, I don't need to see him again, versus having met Harry earlier, I didn't need to see him again. In English, typically, finite verb forms have absolute tense, and nonfinite verb forms have relative tense. In section 4.4 we shall see that in written Arabic and (Mandarin) Chinese there are verb forms that express relative, rather than absolute, tense ; though in the absence of any specification of the time-point relative to which the time reference i s made, this time-point is taken to be the present moment.

J For further discussion, see, for instance, Lyons (1968: 304-6).

• The so-called future tense of many languages has modal as well as tense

value; throughout this book the traditional term 'future tense' is used,

though it should be borne in mind that this is often as much a mood as a

tense.

o. I Definition of aspect
Aspect is quite different from this. The difference in French between il lisait and il lut, or in English between he was reading and he read, is not one of tense, since in both cases we have absolute past tense. It is in this sense that we speak of aspect as being distinct from tense, and insist on such oppositions as that between perfective and imperfective being treated as aspectual, even where the grammatical terminology of individual languages has a tradition of referring to them as tenses.
As the general definition of aspect, we may take the formulation that 'aspects are different ways of viewing the internal temporal constituency of a situation'.l We may illustrate this definition briefly, returning to more detailed exemplification in the body of the book, by considering one of the differences between the aspectual forms given above as examples of aspectual distinctions in various languages, as illustrated in the following translation equivalents:
English: John was reading when I entered. Russian: Ivan cital, kogda ja vose!. French: Jean lisait quand j'entrai. Spanish: Juan leia cuando entre. Italian: Gianni leggeva quando entrai.
In each of these sentences, the first verb presents the background to some event, while that event itself is introduced by the second verb.2 The second verb presents the totality of the situation referred to (here, my entry) without reference to its internal temporal constituency: the whole of the situation is presented as a single unanalysable whole, with beginning, middle, and end rolled into one; no attempt is made to divide this situation up into the various individual phases that make up the action of entry. Verbal forms with this meaning will be said to have perfective meaning, and where the language in question has special verbal forms to indicate this, we shall say that it has perfective aspect.3
1 This is based on the definition given by Holt (1943: 6): 'les manieres
diverses de concevoir l'ecoulement du proces meme', i.e. 'different ways of conceiving the flow of the process itself'. This definition has been generalised somewhat so that it does not refer solely to processes, but also, for instance, to states; see further chapter z. 2 This is a well established pedagogical technique for introducing the concept of aspect in teaching individual languages with oppositions of this
kind. See, for instance, Klein (1974: 98-100).
3 Of the five languages cited here, all but English have perfective aspect in this sense. In English the relation between the Progressive (e.g. was
reading) and non-Progressive (e.g. entereQ) is rather more complex, but
3

Introduction
The other forms, i.e. those referring to the situation of John's reading, do not present the situation in this way, but rather make explicit reference to the internal temporal constituency of the situation. In these examples, in particular, reference is made to an internal portion of John's reading, while there is no explicit reference to the beginning or
to the end of his reading. This is why the sentences are interpreted as
meaning that my entry is an event that occurred during the period that John was reading, i.e. John's reading both preceded and followed my
entry. Another way of explaining the difference between perfective and imperfective meaning is to say that the perfective looks at the situation from outside, without necessarily distinguishing any of the internal structure of the situation, whereas the imperfective looks at the situation from inside, and as such is crucially concerned with the internal struc­ ture of the situation, since it can both look backwards towards the start of the situation, and look forwards to the end of the situation, and indeed is equally appropriate if the situation is onc that lasts through all time, without any beginning and without any end.
In discussing aspect it is important to grasp that the difference
between perfectivity and imperfectivity is not necessarily an objective difference between situations, nor is it necessarily a difference that is presented by the speaker as being objective. It is quite possible for the same speaker to refer to the same situation once with a perfective fonn, then with an imperfective, without in any way being self-contradictory.
This can be illustrated by means of sentences like John read that book yesterday ; while he was reading it, the postman came, or its equivalents in French (Jean lut ce li1-'Te hier ; pendant qu'ille lisait, le facteur vint) or Russian (Ivan procitaletu knigu vcera ; v to vremja, kogda on ee cital, priSel poctal'on). The different forms of the verb ' to read ' all refer to the same situation of reading. In the first clause, however, John's reading is presented as a complete event, without further subdivision into successive temporal phases ; in the second clause, this event is opened up, so that the speaker is now in the middle of the situation of John's reading, and says that it was in the middle of this situation (which he had previously referred to using the form with perfective meaning) that the event of the postman's arrival took place.
provided we restrict ourselves to nonstative verbs and exclude habitual meaning, then the difference between the two forms is one of imperfecti­ vity versus perfectivity, as in the example above. For further discussion, see section 1.2.2 on the progressive.

o. I D efinition of aspect
From the discussion of the previous paragraphs, it will be evident that aspect is not unconnected with time, and the reader may therefore wonder whether this does not vitiate the distinction insisted on above between aspect and tense. However, although both aspect and tense are concerned with time, they are concerned with time in very different ways. As noted above, tense is a deictic category, i.e. locates situations in time, usually with reference to the present moment, though also with reference to other situations. Aspect is not concerned with relating the time of the situation to any other time-point, but rather w ith the internal temporal constituency of the one situation ; one could state the difference as one between situation-internal time (aspect) and situation-external time (tense). In a sentence like John was reading when I entered it might seem that the different forms do serve a deictic function of locating my entry internally to John's reading, but this apparent deictic function is only a secondary consequence of the different ways in which they view the internal constituency of the situations referred to : since was reading places us internally to the reading situation, therefore naturally when we are presented with another situation given to us as a unified whole without internal constituency, this new situation is located temporally at that point in time where we already are, namely internally to John's reading. Similarly, a sequence of forms with perfective meaning will normally be taken to indicate a. sequence of events, e.g. the wind tore off the roof, snapped the clothes-line, and brought dmvtZ the apple-tree. Since each of the three situations is p resented without regard to its internal constitu ency, a natural interpretation is to take them as events that occurred in succession, each one complete in itself; moreover, they will normally he taken to have occurred in the order in which they are presented in the t ext. However, this is by no means a necessary interpre­ tation. It is quite possible, even if unlikely, for all three events to have been simultaneous, and this possi bility can be made explicit by adding an appropriate adverbial to the sentence: the wind simultaneously . . . Another possi bility is that the speaker is not interested in the relative order of the three events, but is simp ly registering his observation of the overall resu lt of the wind's damage, in which case he may not even know the actual order of events.
The precise di.fferentiation of tense and aspect is particularly impor­ tant in considering the perfect,l e.g. English John has read the book (as
1 In this book the terms 'perfective' and 'perfect' are used in quite different senses from one another; see further section 0.3 below.

Int roduction
opposed to John read the book), Spanish Juan ha leMo el libro (as opposed to Juan ley6 el libro).l This problem is discussed, with references, in chapter 3 on the perfect. Traditionally, in works that make a distinction between tense and aspect, the perfect has usually, but not always, been considered an aspect, although it is doubtful whether the definition of aspect given above can be interpreted to include the perfect as an aspect. However, the perfect is equally not just a tense, since it differs in mean­ ing from the various tense forms.2 Since the perfect is very often referred to as an aspect, discussion of it has been included in the present book.3
0.2. Meaning and form So far, aspect has been presented essentially in semantic
terms, with reference to the internal structure of a situation, without any discussion of the formal expression of aspect. A brief comparison with tense will be useful here: there is the semantic concept of time reference (absolute or relative), which may be grammaticalised in a language, i.e. a language may have a grammatical category that expresses time reference, in which case we say that the language has tenses. Many languages lack tenses, i.e. do not have grammaticalised time reference, though probably all languages can lexicalise time reference, i.e. have temporal adverbials that locate situations in time, such as English today, the year before last, at five o'clock. In treatments of aspect, there is no such uniformity of terminology, so that the term • aspect ' is now used to refer to the general semantic oppositions possible, now restricted to particular grammaticalised oppositions based on these semantic distinctions in individual languages.4 In the present book we shall speak
1 In most of the other Romance languages, at least in their spoken forms, the so-called Perfect (or Compound Past) does not necessarily have per­
fect meaning, since the opposition as represented in Spanish ley6 and ha leldo is lost in favour of the compound form in both meanings. The written languages usually maintain the distinction, e.g. French Perfect Jean a lu le livTe versus Past Definite (nonperfect) Jean lut le livTe.
• See further section 3.0. , Part of the difficulty seems to stem from a tendency, once aspect has been
distinguished from tense, to refer to all verbal categories that are neither tense nor mood as aspect. This use of the term 'aspect' suffers from all the disadvantages that accompanied the earlier use of the term 'tense'
as a general cover-term for a variety of different kinds of distinction .
4 I n addition t o the term 'aspect', some linguists also make use of the term 'aktionsart' (plural: aktionsarten): this is a German word meaning 'kinds of action', and although there have been numerous attempts to coin an English equivalent, none of these has become generally accepted. The
6

0.2 Meaning and form
of semantic aspectual distinctions, such as th at between perfective and imperfective meaning, irrespective of whether they are grammaticalised or lexicalised in individual languages. However the noun ' aspect ' will normally, and in the plural ' aspects ' always, be restricted to referring to particular grammatical categories in individual languages that cor­ respond in content to the semantic aspectual distinctions drawn. Other solutions to the terminological problem are possible, and will be found in other works on aspect, though once the policy of the present book has been grasped it should not occasion confusion.
Clearly, in any discussion of aspect, preference will be given to examples from languages where aspect exists as a grammatical category, since such languages provide the clearest examples with which to work, even in discussions of the semantic distinctions underlying these grammatical categories. Thus in discussing perfective and imperfective meaning, the easiest examples to work with are from, for instance, Russian and Spanish (in Spanish, in the past tense only), rather than from, say, English, where this particular opposition has not been grammaticalised, and where the particular opposition that has been grammaticalised, namely that between progressive and nonprogressive meaning, is comparable to the imperfective/perfective distinction only in relation to a limited set of verbs (nonstative verbs), and then only if habitual meaning is excluded.1
Just as some languages do not grammaticalise time reference to give
distinction between aspect and aktionsart is drawn in at least the following two quite different ways. The first distinction is between aspect as grammaticalisation of the relevant semantic distinctions, while aktionsart represents lexicalisation of the distinctions, irrespective of how these distinctions are lexicalised ; this use of aktionsart is similar to the notion of inherent meaning (related to the general semantic definition of aspect given above) discussed in chapter 2. The second distinction, which is that used by most Slavists, and often by scholars in Slavonic countries writing on other languages, is between aspect a9 grammaticalisation of the semantic distinction, and aktionsart as lexicalisation of the distinction provided that the lexicalisation is by means of derivational morphology. (For a general discussion of derivational morphology, see Matthews ( 1 974: chapter m), where it is referred to as lexical morphology.) This restriction of the use of the term 'aktionsart' in Slavonic lingu istics was introduced by Agrell ( 1 908) ; a comprehensive account of the aktionsarten of Russian, in this sense, is given by Isa�enko (1962: 385-418) ; for Bulgarian, see Ivanova ( 1 974). In view of the confusion that can be caused by these two rather different senses of aktionsart, this term will not be used in the present book. 1 See further section 1 .2.2. on the progressive.

Introduction
tenses, so some languages do not grammaticalise semantic aspectual distinctions to give aspects. In some forms of German, for instance,
namely those where the Simple Past (e.g. ich ging 'I went') has been supplanted completely by the Perfect (e.g. ich bin gegangen 'I have
gone ', in these forms of German also ' I went '), there is no grammatical­ isation of aspectual distinctions.1 This does not mean that in these forms of German it is impossible to express the meaning differences that are expressed by means of aspects in those languages that do have aspects.
The difference between English he read the book and he was reading the book can to some extent be captured in German by the difference between er las das Buch (which covers the semantic range of both of the English sentences) and er las im Buch, literally ' he read in-the book ', which has explicitly the meaning of the English Progressive was reading.
However, this particular way of expressing the semantic difference is not generalisable beyond a very limited set of verbs. In Finnish, the difference between these two sentences can, indeed in this case must, be expressed by a difference in the case of the direct object : in the first
sentence the direct object will be in the accusative, i.e. hiin luki kirjan
'he read the book ', while in the second it will be in the partitive, i.e.
hiin luki kirjaa 'he was reading the book '. However, this is not generalis­
able to all instances: the distinction is completely inapplicable with verbs that do not take a direct object, while in many sentence pairs that do have a direct object the difference between the one with accusative direct object and the one with partitive direct object is not a semantic aspectual distinction at a11.2
So far, we have not placed any restriction on how semantic aspectual distinctions are to be grammaticalised in order to qualify as aspects, and
1 These forms of German do have distinct Pluperfect and Future Perfect. However, as noted in section 3.0, these forms do not necessarily indicate perfect meaning, but may simply indicate relative past time reference.
2 The basic meaning of the partitive case in Finnish is that only part of the object referred to is affected by the situation; where a contrast between partitive and non-partitive is possible, the nonpartitive means that the whole of the object is affected. One possible realisation of this distinction is that between perfective and imperfective meaning: since imperfective meaning implies a situation in progress, it equally entails the incomplete affecting of the direct object. However, it is possible for the direct object of a verb with perfective meaning to be only partially affected, as in hiin otti ruokaa 'he took some food' (cf. hiin otti moan 'he took (all of)
the food' with the accusative), or mies ampu; lintua pyrstoiin ' the man
shot the bird in the tail', where only part of the bird (its tail) is aITected.
For details of the partitive in Finnish, see Dcnison (1957).
8

0.2 Meaning and form
indeed we shall not be placing any such additional restrictions, although many other writers on aspect have attempted to do so. Thus aspect as a grammatical category, j ust like any other grammatical category, may be expressed by means of the inflectional morphology of the language in question, as with Spanish ZeYe) and Zeia cited above; it may also be expressed by means of a periphrasis, as with English he was reading, the periphrastic Progressive, �s opposed to the simple verb form he read.l Further details of the particular formal devices used to express aspectual oppositions in various languages belong to the grammar of those indivi­ dual languages, and not to a general book on aspect ; in chapter 5 , however, certain recurrent parallels among languages i n the formal expression of aspectual oppositions will be discussed and interpreted.
In practice, the relation between grammatical categories of individual languages and semantic categories is even more complex than is sug­ gested by the simplistic view of semantic categories that are either grammaticalised or not in particular languages. On the one hand, language-particular categories often combine aspect with some other category, most usually tense. The Spanish Imperfect, for instance, as in Juan Zeia I Juan was reading, Juan used to read ', combines both imper­ fective meaning and past time reference, i.e. combines both tense and aspect. The same is true of the so-called Perfective in written Arabic (section 4.4), which combines perfective meaning and relative past time reference. On the other hand, one often finds language-particular categories that correspond closely, but not exactly, ta semantic distinc­ tions : in section 1.2.2, for instance, we shall see that the English Pro­ gressive typically expresses progressive meaning, although its range is in
1 Thus Klein (1 974: 76) criticises linguists who consider the English Progressive to be an aspect, since it is a verbal periphrasis. It is, of course,
possible to build this restriction into onc's definition, but the problem
then arises of how to refer to such categories as the English Progressive wh:ch are aspectual semantically, are systematically opposed to non­
Progressive forms, but are expressed by means of periphrases. There is a
more general problem here, which concerns morphology and syntax as a whole rather than just aspect, namely that it is not always easy to draw
precise boundaries between derivational (lexical) and inflectional mor­
phology, nor between morphology and syntax (the English Progressive being a case in point). It is usual to consider the French construction etre en train de 'to be in the process of ' as a free syntactic construction that expresses progressive meaning, rather than as a grammatical category of French. although it is not clear exactly where the boundary-line would be drawn between this and the English or Spanish Progrcssives, which arc
usually considered as grammatical categories.

Introduction
fact somewhat wider than is predicted by the general semantic definition of progressive meaning. To avoid confusion between language-particular categories and semantic distinctions defined independently of any particular language, in this book the policy has been adopted of using an initial capital for the names of language-particular categories, whether referring to the category as such or to forms that belong to that category, while not using initial capitals for language-independent semantic distinctions. This typographical convention should be noted carefully in working through the book.
In relating language-particular categories to language-independent semantic characterisations, it is possible, in principle, either to start from the language-particular categories and associate them with their meaning or meanings, or to start from the semantic distinctions and see how, if at all, these are grammaticalised in the individual language (in addition to the possible combination of the two approaches). In a work dealing with aspect from the viewpoint of general linguistics, the second approach, from meaning to form, is the more feasible, since the centre of interest is not the particular forms that exist in any one particular language. In the present work, therefore, various general semantic distinctions are introduced and illustrated by means of language.·particular categories that correspond more or less closely to the semantic distinctions established. This does, of course, mean that it will not always be the case that the particular language used to illustrate a general point will have a category that corresponds exactly to the semantic distinction involved - where this does appear to be the case, it is often because not enough work has been done on finer points of usage concerning the language-particular category - but only that there is su fficient overlap to make comparison viable.
It might be thought that the ideal would be to establish for each language-particular category a general characterisation1 of its meaning such that each one of its individual uses would be predictable from this general characterisation (and, equally, one would be able to predict when not to use the form in question), and there would be no need to speak of only partial correspondence between formal categories and semantic distinctions. To take this as one's starting-point is, of course, to beg the whole question of the degree of complexity of the relation between formal categories and semantic distinctions. An alternative

0.3 Terminology
approach would be to try and provide the simplest possible characterisa­ tion of this relation : in cases where there is a general meaning from which all individual uses are predictable, then this will indeed be the simplest characterisation of the relation, but this approach does not p rejudge the question of whether or not there is a single general mean­ ing. In the present work, then, where we speak of a given catego ry having several meanings, the possibility is not excluded that subsequent work may show that these various meanings are in fact different manifesta­ tions of one general meaning, or at least of a smaller number of meanings.
Where a form is said to have more than one meaning, it is often the case that one of these meanings seems more central, more typical than the others. In such cases, it is usual to speak of this central meaning as the basic meaning.l In certain cases the existence of both basic and secondary meanings can be shown to be the result of a historical process where the basic meaning is the original meaning, while secondary meanings have been acquired as extensions of this original meaning, often leading ultimately to the same form acquiring a new basic meaning much wider than the original basic meaning, and incorporating a number of uses that were originally secondary meanings. One example of this is discussed in section 3 . 1.4, on the development of the Perfect in many Romance languages to oust the Simple Past, via gradual relaxation of the requirement of present relevance in the use of the Perfect to refer to a past situation. A similar process can be observed in Welsh, for instance, where what was originally a periphrastic form with progressive meaning has gradually extended i ts domain to encompass almost the whole of imperfective meaning in the present tense, with the exception of only a few stative verbs.
0.3. Terminology As already indicated, in discussions of aspect, as opposed to
many other areas of linguistics, there is no generally accepted termino­ logy. The present section will introduce some of the terms used in this book, in particular those where confusion with other terminological systems is especially likely to lead to misunderstanding if the differences between the various terminologies are not appreciated. It should not be thought that all such differences are terminological - in many cases there are also deep-seated conceptual differences - but in a large number of

Introduction
i nstances the difference is purely one of terminology. On the one hand, different labels are often used to refer to the same phenomenon, while on the other hand, and even more confusingly, the same label is often applied by different linguists to radically different concepts.
In this book, the terms ' perfect ' and ' perfective ' are used in very different senses from one another. The term ' perfective ' contrasts with ' imperfective ', and denotes a situation viewed in its entirety, without regard to internal temporal constituency; the term ' perfect ' refers to a past situation which has present relevance, for instance the present result of a past event (his arm has been broken). This terminological distinction is usual in discussions of aspect by Continental linguists, and is insisted on by Slavists, who have to deal with languages li ke Bulgarian and Old Church Slavonic where both of these oppositions, perfective/imperfective and perfect/nonperfect, are grammaticalised. In many recent works by English-speaking linguists, however, there has been an unfortunate tendency to use the term ' perfective ' for what is here termed • perfect '; this tendency is particularly unfortunate when it leads to conceptual confusion, such as the view that what Slavists call perfective is the same as perfect in, say, English. In place of the term • perfective ' some linguists use the term • aoristic ' ; in the traditional grammatical terminologies of some languages, however, the term • aorist ' is restricted to perfectivity in the past tense (e.g. Bulgarian, Georgian, also some writers on Spanish), and to avoid this possible confusion the term has not been used as part of the general linguistic terminology here.1
In the discussion of subdivisions of imperfectivity, a distinction is madebetween the terms • progressive ' and • continuous ', the former being a subdivision of the latter (progressiveness is the combination of cor.­ tinuousness with nonstativity). In traditional discussions of English, the forms here referred to as Progressive (e.g. John was reading) are sometimes referred to as continuous, so the particular distinction made here between the two terms should be carefully noted.
In the discussion of language-particular categories, the traditional names ofthese categories in the grammar of the language concerned have usually been retained. This has meant in certain cases using different terms for language-particular categories expressing more or less the

tense, although it does have some nonpast uses. In other moods and in nonfinite forms, the Aorist is purely aspectual, not an expression oftense.

0.4 Structure of the book
same semantic distinctions (such as Aorist, Past Definite, for perfective past, in Bulgarian and written French respectively), and, rather less felicitously, using traditional terms that do not correspond to the general linguistic terminology used in this book (e.g. the Latin Perfect, which is a perfective past, and does not distinguish perfect/nonp erfect meaning;1 the Arabic Perfective, which is a perfective relative past, although the term seems to refer only to its aspectual value).2 Careful observation of the use of initial capitals should prevent any confusion.
In discussing aspect, it is often necessary to refer to the differences between states, events, processes, etc.; these are discussed more fully in chapter 2. However, while ordinary nontechnical language provides, with a limited amount of systematisation, a metalanguage for these various subdivisions, it does not provide any general term to subsume them all. In the present work the term ' situation ' is used as this general cover-term, i.e. a situation may be either a state, or an event, or a process. The use of the terms ' state ', ' event', ' process ' is discussed in further detail in section 2.3. For the present, we may take the distinction as follows : states a re static, i.e. continue as before unless changed, whereas events and processes are dynamic, i.e. require a continual input of energy if they are not to come to an end ; events are dynamic situations viewed as a complete whole (perfectively), whereas processes are dynamic situations viewed in progress, from within ( imperfectively).
0+ Structure of the book A brief outline of the structure of the book will enable the
reader to find his way more easily about the book as a whole. The core of the book is formed by chapters I to 3, in which the major
concepts utilised in the study of aspect are introduced and discussed. Chapter I discusses in greater deta il the distinctions between perfective and imperfective, already outlined in section 0.1; it also discusses briefly some of the misleading characterisations of this distinction that appear in the literature, in particular the earlier literature, although some of these can still be found in more recent work. This chapter then goes on to discuss various subdivision.s of imperfectivity, in particular habituality, continuousness, and progressiveness. The interaction of different aspectual categories with one another in a variety of languages is also discussed and illustrated.
1 E.g, 1Iecavi 'I killed', or 'I have killed'. 2 See funher section 4+

Introductioll
Chapter 2 looks at how the inherent meaning of certain lexical items and syntactic combinations of lexical items can determine semantic aspectual characteristics, and how these in turn interact with the aspectual categories of individual languages. Distinctions discussed include that between state and dynamic situation, that between durative and punctual situations, that between being in a state or process, enter­ ing a state or process, and leaving a state of process, and that between situations which move towards a logical conclusion (telic) and those that do not.
The perfect is discussed in chapter 3, which gives examples of various kinds of perfect all consistent with the general characterisation of perfectness as the present relevance of a prior situation.
Chapters 4 and 5 use the conceptual background provided by the earlier chapters. Chapter 4 investigates the interaction of aspect and tense in various languages, and also aspect and voice. In chapter 5, formal means of expressing aspect are discussed where the particular formal devices used are closely linked to the semantic distinction expressed, and thus provide a window onto the semantic distinctions.
Chapter 6 discusses the concept of markedness as applied to aspectual oppositions, both in the sense in which it is used by adherents of the Prague School, and in the somewhat wider sense it has gained in more recent linguistic literature.
Finally, two appendices give a genetic classification of the languages cited in the book with brief characterisations of the aspectual systems of some of the languages that play a major role in the presentation of data i n the body of the book, and introduce the reader briefly to three recent approaches to the analysis of aspect.
0. 5 . General reading There are relatively few works on aspect from the viewpoint
of general linguistics, rather than in individual languages; references to works on individual languages will be found in appendix A, and in the list of references at the end nf the book. An influential general work is Holt ( 1 943), with emphasis on Slavonic and Ancient Greek material.
Two readers which reprint a number of articles, both theoretical and descriptive, are Maslov ( 1 962a) and Schopf ( 1 974a). All the articles in Maslov ( 1 962a), and the editor's introduction (Maslov 1 962b) are reprinted in Russian. Those in Schopf ( 1974a) are reprinted in English or German ; the editor's introductory sections are in German. Although

0.5 General reading
this latter reader deals primarily with the English Progressive, it also contains a number of introductory articles on aspect from a general linguistic viewpoint, and has a comprehensive bibliography of general works on aspect.
For an early critique of the tendency to classify various heterogeneous distinctions as aspect, see Jespersen (1924 : 286-9),1 though with a rather different terminology from that in most l ater works.
1 Although Jespersen heads this section 'Aspect', he says : 'I do not give the following system as representing variolls "aspects" or "aktionsarten" of the verb, but expressly say that the different phenomena which others have brought together under this one class (or these two classes) should not from a purely notional point of view be classed together' (p. 287).

I
Perfective and imperfective
1 .0. The distinction between perfectivity and imperfectivity has already been outlined, in section 0. 1 : perfectivity indicates the view of a situation as a single whole, without distinction of the various separate
phases that make up that situation ; while the imperfective pays essential attention to the internal structure of the situation. The present chapter
will look at this distinction in further detail, with examples drawn from
various languages.
I. I . Perfective I . I . I . Definition ofperfectivity
Before illustrating in more detail what is meant by per­ fectivity, it may be worth discussing briefly some frequently cited, but essentially inadequate characterisations of this notion : many of these
are quite widespread in the general linguistic literature on aspect and in grammars of individual languages, and lead frequently to incorrect
assessments of the role of aspect.!
It is sometimes claimed that perfective forms indicate situations of short duration, while imperfective fonns indicate situations of long
duration. It is easy to find examples from individual languages that
contradict this assertion, perhaps the clearest being where both per­ fective and imperfective forms can be used in referring to the same
length of time, without any necessary implication of the duration being
1 Since we are not concerned with the history of theories of aspect, except incidentally, detailed references have not been given for each of the various characterisations discussed below. A first-rate summary of the historical development of accounts of perfectivity (and imperfectivity), with particular regard to Slavonic, is given by Dostal ( 1 954 : I Q- I S). Some
of these earlier accounts, in particular those from the nineteenth century,
though shown to be inadequate by later work, still played an important role in the development of the study of aspect.

short or long. Thus in Russian, I stood there for an hour can be

translated either in the Imperfective, ja stojal tarn cas, or in at least the

following two perfective forms : ja postojal tarn cas, ja prostojal tam cas.

To the extent that any of these give any indication of whether the period

of standing was long or short, it is the first Perfective version (with postojal) that suggests a (subjectively) short period, and the second

Perfective version (with prostojal) that suggests a (subjectively) long

period, while the Imperfective (stojal) is quite nl!utral. Similarly, in

French the difference between il regnait (Imperfect) trente ans

of objective or subjective difference in the period of the reign ; rather the

former gathers the whole period of thirty years into a single complete

whole, corresponding roughly to the English ' he had a reign of thirty

years ', i.e. one single reign, VI' hile the second says rather that at any

point during those thirty years he was indeed reigning, i.e. is connected

more with the internal structuring of the reign, and wnuld be more appropriate as a background statement to a discussion of the individual

events that occurred during his reign. Similarly in Ancient Greek, we

find the Aorist (perfective past) in ebasileuse deka etl ' he reigned ten years ', or rather ' he had a reign of ten years ', to bring out the difference between this form and the Imperfect (imperfective past) ebas{/eue deka etl ' he reigned for ten years ', or more explicitly ' he was reigning during

ten years ' .

Equally, the perfective cannot be defined as describing a situation
with limited, as opposed to unlimited, duration ; an hour, ten years,
tJ'lirty years, are all limite4 periods, but as the examples above show both perfective and imperfective forms can be used to describe such

duration.
Related te the concept of perfectivity as indicating a short period of time is its characterisation as indicating a punctual (i.e. point-like) or momentary situation. Examples such as those disc.us�cd above serve to
disconfirm this view of perfectivity, since in each case they refer to a
situation extending over a (long) period of time, :md are not used specifically for momentary situations of the type ' give a cough ', ' give
a slap '.l While it is incorrect to say that the basic function of the
perfective is to represent an event as momentary or punctual, there is
some truth in the view that the perfective, by not giving direct expres­
sion to the internal structure of a situation, irrespective of its objective

Perfective and imperfective
complexity, has the effect of reducing it to a single point. In section 1 . 1 .2, however, we shall see that perfectivity can be combined with certain other aspectual properties, in accordance with the general morphological and syntactic properties of the individual language, and that this yields perfective forms that are clearly not punctual, such as Russian on pozapiral vse dveri ' he locked each of the doors individually, locked them one after the other ' : the clement ' each ', ' individually ', or ' one after the other ' is essential to an adequate rendering in English of pozapiral, which contrasts with another Perfective form zaper, which would also cover the possibility of simultaneous locking of all the doors. Since the notion of a point seems to preclude internal complexity, a
more helpful metaphor would perhaps be to say that the perfective
reduces a situation to a blob, rather than to a point : a blob is a three­
dimensional object, and can therefore have internal complexity.
although it is nonetheless a single object with clearly circumscribed
limits.
A very frequent characterisation of perfectivity is that it indicates a completed action. One should note that the word at issue in this defini� tion is ' completed ', not ' complete ' : despite the formal similarity
between the two words, there is an important semantic distinction which
turns out to be crucial in discussing aspect. The perfective does indeed denote a complete situation, with beginning. middle, and end. The use of ' completed ', however, puts too much emphasis on the termination of the situation, whereas the use of ti,e perfective puts no more emphasis, necessarily, on the end of a situation than on any other part of the situation, rather all parts of the situation are presented as a single whole.!" The existence of a Perfective Future in Russian, for instance, e.g. ja ub'iu tebja ' I shall kill you ', and of subordinate perfective forms with (relative) future time reference in Ancient Greek, for instance, e.g. boll/etai tofito poilsai ' he wishes to do this ', with the Aorist Infinitive, further demonstrates the inadequacy of ' completed ', rather than ' complete ', as a characterisation of the perfective.2 In Russian, some
1 The confusion has been partly fostered by the terminology of many grammatical traditions, e.g. Czech dokollQVY, Polish dokollOny, Latin
prrjrcti'l.Jum, all of which derive from verbs meaning 'to complete' .
2 I nterestingly enough, the so-calIed Perfective i n Arabic, which is also
often defined as indicating a completed situation, is not the form used for
future time reference, even for situations viewed as complete ; see further section 4+
18

I . I Perjecti've
verbs do have derivationally related forms that indicate specifically the completion of a situation : thus alongside uzinat' (Ipfv.) ' have supper ' there is otuzinat' ' finish supper ' , as in my tol'ko cto ottlzinali ' we've just finished supper ' ; however, this verb is distinct from the Perfective of uzinat', which is pouzinat', as in my pouzinali posle polunoci ' we had supper after midnight ', referring to the whole of the meal, not just its end. Indicating the end of a situation is at best only one of the possible meanings of a perfective form, certainly not its defining feature. A per­ fective form often indicates the completion of a situation when it is
explicitly contrasted with an imperfective form : since the imperfective
indicates a situation in progress, and since the perfective indicates a
situation which has an end, the only new semantic element introduced by
the perfective is that of the termination of the situation, as in Russian on dolgo ugovari7)al (Ipfv.) menja, no ne ugovoril (Pfv.) ' he persuaded (Ipfv.) me for a long time, but didn't persuade (Pfv.) me ', i.e. ' he spent a long time trying to persuade me, but didn't actually persuade me '.
I n many languages that have a distinction between perfective and
imperfective forms, the perfective forms of some verbs, in particular of
some stative verbs, can in fact be used to indicate the beginning of a situation (ingressive meaning). In Ancient Greek, for instance, the Aorist (perfective past) of the verb basilezio ' I reign ' can refer to a complete reign, as in ebasileusa deka ete ' I reigned for ten years, had a reign of ten years ', but it can also refer to the start of the reign, i.e. ebaslleusa ' I became king, ascended the throne ' versus Imperfect (imperfective past) ebasileuon ' I was king ' . Similarly with the verb stlnoikea ' I cohabit ', as in alhi para ziintos Timokrdtotls ekeinoi sunoikese (Aorist) ' but leaving Timocrates, who was still alive, she went to live with him '.1 A similar situation obtains in Spanish with, for instance, the verbs ver ' see ', conocer ' know ' (i.e. ' be acquainted with '), saber ' know ' (for instance, know a fact) : the Simple Past (perfective past) of these verbs often indicates the start of a new situation, as in conoci (Simple Past) a Pedro hace muchos aiios ' I got to know Pedro many years ago ' . In Russian, ponjat', the Perfective o fponimat' ' understand ', usually has the meaning ' come to understand, grasp ', as in nakonec on ponjal, v cem delo ' at last he grasped what was up '.2 In Mandarin Chinese, too,
I The Ancient Greek examples are from Goodwin ( 1 889 : 1 6) . I In Russian, given the way in which aspect is expressed morphologically
(see section 5 . 1 . 1), it is often difficult to decide whether semantically similar Perfective and Imperfective forms are in fact different aspectual

Perfecti'l·e and imperfective
a number of predicates, both adjectives and verbs, that normally refer to a state can have ingressive meaning in the Perfective, e.g. ta gao ' he is tall ', ta gao-le (Pfv.) ' he became tall, has become tall '.1 Clearly, one cannot say that such perfective forms indicate the completion of a
situation, when in fact they refer to its inception.
A possible analysis of this ingressive meaning would be to say that such verbs can in general be either stative or ingressive, i.e. can in general refer either to the state or to entry into that state, like, for instance, English sit (which can mean either ' be sitting ' or ' adopt a sitting position ') i compare also English and suddenly he knew/understood what was happening, where the meaning is also ingressive. One could further claim tliat the choice between ingressive and stative interpreta­ tion is determined by the context, rather than by any special proviso that such perfective forms can have ingressive meaning. Whether this claim can be maintained is, however, doubtful, since there is a crucial difference between sit, for instance, on the one hand, and the other verbs listed here : sit can be used in all forms with the meaning ' adopt a sitting posture ', including forms with imperfective meaning, e.g. the Progressive he isjust sitting down. One cannot, however, use know in this way ( "'he's knowing what's happening), nor the similar forms from the other languages. Know thus differs from realise, which refers explicitly to entry into a new situation, and can be used in the Progressive (he's slowly realising what's happening). There may be some sense in saying that since states are less likely to be described by perfective forms than are events (including entries into states), then there is some functional value in utilising the perfective forms of stative verbs to denote the event of entry into the appropriate state, since otherwise there would be little use for the perfective forms of these verbs, but such an explanation is at present speculative.
Similar to the definition of the perfective in terms of a completed
action is its definition as being a resultative, i.e. indicating the successful completion of a situation. I t is true that perfective forms of certain
individual verbs do effectively indicate the successful completion of a
situation, as with Russian ja ugovoril (Pfv.) ego versus ja ugovarival ( I pfv.) ego, which could be rendered into English as ' I succeeded in
forms of the same verb, or different verbs, albeit related in the deriva­ tional morphology. In the case ofponimat'/ponjat', other verbs of this rare morphological pattern are aspectual pairs (e.g. nanimat'/nanjat' 'hire', lItanimat '/zanjat' 'occupy'), suggesting that ponimat'/ponjat' is too. I Cp. Jaxontov ( 1 957 : 1 1 6).
20

I . I Perfective
persuading him ' and ' I tried to persuade him '.l But resultativity is only one possible type of perfectivity, and the term ' resultative ', like the term ' completed ', puts unnecessary emphasis on the final stage of the situation rather than on its totality. Again, usages like Spanish supe ' I realised, came to know '; from saber ' know ', contradict the view that perfectivity indicates successful completion : whatever the event referred to by supe is the successful outcome of, it is not the situation referred to by saMa ' I knew ' ; if anything, the reverse is true, with the situation referred to by the imperfective sab{a being the result of the event referred to by supe.
Finally, we may consider the view that the perfective represents the action pure and simple, without any additional overtones. In effect, this claims that perfectives are the unmarked members of any aspectual opposition based on perfectivity ; we shall return to the question of markedness with relation to aspectual oppositions later (chapter 6), but for the moment it will suffice to note that there are both languages where a perfective is marked (e.g. the Perfective in the Slavonic languages), and languages where a perfective is unmarked (e.g. the Past Definite in French, the Aorist in Ancient Greek, B ulgarian, and Georgian). Thus this attempted definition does not give a language­ independent definition of perfectivity, and even in those languages where it does identify the perfective this is not because of the inherent meaning of the perfective, but rather because of the functioning of the perfective as the unmarked member of the binary opposition perfective! imperfective.
I . 1 .2 . Perfectivity and other aspectual values
From the definition of perfectivity given above, it follows that perfectivity involves lack of explicit reference to the internal temporal constituencyofa situation, rather than explicitly implying the lack of such internal temporal constituency. Thus it is quite possible for perfective forms to be used for situations that are internally complex, such as those that last for a considerable period of time, or include a number of distinct internal phases, provided only that the whole of the situation is subsumed as a single whole. "Clearly the internal structure of such situations cannot be referred to directly by the choice of a perfective form, since this is precisely what perfective forms cannot indicate, but such reference can be made explicitly by other means, such as the
1 See further section 2 . 2 .

Perfective and imperfective
lexical meaning of the verb involved, or other aspectual oppositions, or other facets of the context. The present section will look at various examples which illustrate this phenomenon more clearly.
As already noted, perfectivity is by no means incompatible with overt expression of the duration of a situation, as in the following examples, repeated for convenience, all of which contain perfective verb forms : French if regna trente ans, Ancient Greek ebasileuse deka eie ' he reigned thirty years ', Russian on postojallprostojal tarn cas ' he stood there for an hour '.! To this list we might add Mandarin Chinese bdgong jixU-le (Pfv.) wu tion ' the strike lasted for five days ' .2 The Russian examples are particularly interesting here in that the sole function of the per­ fectivising prefixes po- and pro- with verbs of this class is to indicate a temporally restricted, but nonpunctual, situation ;3 i.e. here it is the lexical meaning of the verb in po- or pro- that explicitly expresses duration.
In Spanish, in the past tense, the opposition Simple Past versus Imperfect can be expressed independently of the opposition Progressive versus non-Progressive, the former by the form of the finite verb, the latter by the use or non-use of the construction estar plus Present Participle. In principle, then, one might expect, on structural grounds, the form Aorist of estar plus Present Participle, i.e. in effect a perfective progressive, such as estuvieron entrando ' they entered, were entering '. And in practice such forms do occur, albeit rarely, as in toda la tarde estuvieron entrando visitas ' all the afternoon visitors kept arriving '.4
t In Russian, there is a clear test to tell whether a verb is Perfective or Imperfective. Imperfective verbs have a Future Tense distinct from the
Present Tense, and fonned with the auxiliary budu plus the Infinitive ;
Perfective verbs have only onc non-Past Tense, and cannot be used with
budu. (For the time reference of the Perfective non-Past, see section 4. 1 .) The simple verb stojat ' has Present ja stoju 'I stand, am standing', and Future ja budll stojat' ' I shall stand, shall be standing'. The prefixed
verbs postojat' and prostojat ' have only one non-Past, normally with
future meaning, i.e. ja postoju 'I shall stand for a while', ja prostojll (cas) ' I shall stand (for all of an hour)' ; there is n o "'ja budu postojat ' or ·ja budu prostojat'. Thus stojat ' is Imperfective, while postojat' and prostojat '
are both Perfective. , Jaxontov ( 1 957 : I I 7). • Sce further Isa�enko ( 1 962 : 391-3 , 3 94), who uses the tenns 'delimita­
tive' for such verbs in po-, and the term 'perdurative' for such verbs in pro-.
• This example is quoted by Stevenson ( 1 970 : 63), with the comment 'the action, though viewed as continuous or continuing in time, is also regarded as a complete whole'.
22

1 . 1 Perfective
The situation described is one that lasted through time (in fact, the whole of the afternoon), and consists of a number of distinct phases (the various arrivals), whence the Progressive ; however, the whole complex is equally presented as a single complete whole, whence the Simple Past. Similar usages are found in Portuguese, e.g. ele esteve lendo em casa 0 dia inteiro • he spent the whole day at home reading '.1
In Bulgarian, again in the past tense, there are two morphological oppositions corresponding to the perfective versus nonperfective distinction, namely that between Perfective and Imperfective, and that between Aorist and Imperfect. One of the main uses of the apparently self-contradictory Imperfective Aorist is precisely to indicate an action which is presented as a single whole (whence the Aorist as marker of perfectivity), but with internal complexity (whence the Imperfective as marker of imperfectivity), as in the following example :2 pred mnogi ikoni oste pop Stefan 'l)odi (Ipfv. Aorist) djada Nedka. Te se spiraxa (Ipfv. Aorist) pred sv. Nikolaj Cudotvorec, . . ., pred obrazite na arxangelite Gavrail i Mixail . . . ' Father Stephen led (Ipfv. Aorist) old Nedko in front of many other icons. They stopped (Ipfv. Aorist) before St. Nicholas the Thaumaturge, . . ., before the images of the archangels Gabriel and Michael . . .'
Russian, with its less profuse aspectual morphology, is not normally able to give direct expression to a single whole with internal structuring : either the situation is presented as a single whole (Perfective), or it is unfolded into its component parts (Imperfective). However, where internal structuring can be indicated other than by the Perfective! Imperfective opposition, then Russian too can directly express situations viewed in the way we have been discussing. With the Perfective zaperet' ' lock ', we can have sentences like on zaper dver' ' he locked the door ', on zaper vse dveri ' he locked all the doors ' ; the latter simply informs us that he locked all the doors, without giving any indication as to how (in what order, or perhaps all at once by pushing a control­ button) the doors were locked. But there is also the derivationally related
1 Thomas ( 1 969 : 202). Esteve lendo is literally 'was (Simple Past) reading' ;
in English the force of both Simple Past and Progressive can be brought out by facto ring out the Simple Past spent and the Progressive form reading. A similar combination of aspects is possible in English with
constructions of the type : it happmed (perfective) one day that I was
walking (imperfective) along the street . . . , I happened one day to be
walking along the street • • •

Perfective and imperfective
Perfective verb pozapirat', as in on pozapiral vse dveri, which specifies that the doors were locked individually, one after the other :l although the Perfective Aspect still views the situation as a single complete whole, the distributive lexical meaning of this verb gives information as to the internal constituency of this action. Compare also vse povskakali so svoix mest ' they all jumped up from their seats (one after the other) , versus vse vskocili so svoix mest ' they all jumped up from their seats (possibly all together) '.
The same phenomenon obtains with a Russian verb like pereklikat'sja (Ipfv.)/perekliknut' (Pfv.) ' call to one another ', which refers to a sequential interchange of calls ; cp. also peremigivat'sja (Ipfv.)/peremig­ nut'sja (Pfv.) ' wink at one another ', i.e. a sequential interchange of winks.2 With the Perfective in a sentence like deti perekliknulis' ' the children called to one another ', the internal phases of the situation are referred to by the lexical meaning of the verb, while the Perfective draws them together as a single whole. As a final Russian example, we may consider posetiteli ponanesli grjazi v komnatu ' little by little, the visitors brought lots of mud into the room '.3 The Perfective ponanesli here indicates a gradual process whereby each of the visitors brought some mud into the room until a stage was reached where a considerable amount of mud had been accumulated in the room. This may be con­ trasted with the semantically more neutral posetiteli prinesli grjaz' v komnatu ' the visitors brought mud into the room '.
1 .2. Imperfective 1 .2.0. From the above discussion, the general characterisation of imperfectivity will already be apparent, namely explicit reference to the internal temporal structure of a situation, viewing a situation from
within ; as also will be the general point that imperfectivity is not incompatible with perfectivity, and that both can be expressed if the
language in question possesses the formal means to do so, as in the examples quoted in section 1.1.2.
While many languages do have a single category to express imper­ fectivity, there are other languages where imperfectivity is subdivided into a number of distinct categories, and yet others where there is some

We may look briefly at some languages which have aspects expressing different groupings of these semantic distinctions. English, for instance, has a separate Habitual Aspect, though only in the past tense, e.g. John used to work here ; there is also a separate Progressive, e.g. John was working (when I entered) ; otherwise there is just the Simple form, with no further distinction of aspect, indeed given the optionality of the Habitual Aspect in English a sentence like John 'U'OTked here may have habitual meaning, the only excluded possibility being progressive mean­ ing. In the past tense Spanish, however, has a straight distinction between perfective and imperfective, in the Simple Past/Imperfect distinction, e.g. Juan llego (Simple Past) ' John arrived ' versus Juan llegaba (Imperfect) ' John was arriving, John used to arrive ' ; there is a separate Progressive form, Juan estaba llegando ' John was arriving ', although this form is optional, since Juan l/egaba docs not exclude progressive meaning. In vVelsh, different dialects have different systems in the past tense, although the existence of a Simple Past with perfective meaning is common to all dialects, e.g. darllenais i ' Y Faner ' ' I read The Banner '. In South Welsh this contrasts with the one, periphrastic, form yr oeddwn i yn darllen ' Y Faner ' ' I was reading The Banner ' or ' I used to read The Banner '. In North Welsh, however, the form yr oeddwn i yn darllen ' Y Faner ' is nonhabitual, i.e. ' I was reading The Banner ', whereas there is a separate habitu al form, the so-called Imperfect, e.g. darllenwn i ' Y Faner ' ' I used to read The Banner '. In Lithuanian, too, the so-called Imperfect indicates habituality, e.g.

2 ' :Z

Perfective and imperfective
atsikeldavau anksti ' I used to get up early ' ; thus begdavau (Imperfect) ' I used to run ' contrasts with the other past tense begau ' I ran, I was running '. The following languages all have a general imperfective form, which thus corresponds to both Habitual and Progressive (as well as non-Progressive forms that do not have perfective meaning) in English ; all the sentences may be glossed as ' he was reading, uscd to read Le Monde, Pravda, Rabotnilesko delo, Td Nea, Brdzola ' : French il lisait (Imperfect) ' Le Monde ' ; Russian on lital (Ipfv.) ' Pravdu ' j Bulgarian leteie (Ipfv. Imperfect) ' Rabotnilesko delo ' ; Modern Greek didvaze (Ipfv. Past) ' Td Nea ' ; Georgian is �itxulobda (Ipfv. Imperfect) ' Br3olas '.
In traditional grammars of many languages with a category covering the whole of imperfectivity, the impression is given that the general area of imperfcctivity must be subdivided into two quite distinct concepts of habituality and continuousness.1 Thus one is told that the imperfective form expresses either a habitual situation or a situation viewed in its duration, and the term 'imperfective ' is glossed as ' continuous-habitual' (or ' durative-habitual '). This approach, unlike that adopted in the present book, fails to recognise that these various subdivisions do in fact join together to form a single unified concept, as is suggested by the large number of languages that have a single category to express imperfectivity as a whole, irrespective of such subdivisions as habituality and continuousness.
In discussing perfectivity, we noted that it is possible to use perfective forms to refer to situations that have internal structure. From the definition of imperfectivity, however, it follows that imperfective fonns cannot be used to refer to situations lacking internal structure. The
question that remains is whether or not there are any situations that are
strictly punctual, in the sense that they cannot be viewed as lasting in time, as consisting of several successive phases. We shall return to this question in section 2. I .
1 .2. 1 . Habitual 1 .2. I .0. In discussing habituality and continuousness, it is easiest to start by giving a positive definition of habituality, leaving continuous­ ness to be defined negatively as imperfectivity that is not habituality. Most of this section will, therefore, be concerned with the definition of habituality.

1 .2 Imperfective
In some discussions of habituality, it is assumed that habituality is essentially the same as iterativity, i.e. the repetition of a situation, the successive occurrence of several instances of the given situation.1 This terminology is misleading in two senses. Firstly, the mere repetition of a situation is not sufficient for that situation to be referred to by a specifically habitual (or, indeed, imperfective) form. If a situation is repeated a limited number of times, then all of these instances of the situation can be viewed as a single situation, albeit with internal structure, and referred to by a perfective form. Imagine, for instance, a scene where a lecturer stands up, coughs five times, and then goes on to deliver his lecture. In English, this could be described as follows : the lecturer stood up, coughedjive times, and said . . . It would not be possible to use the specifically habitual form with used to, i.e. not ·the lecturer stood up, used to cough jive times, and said . . . In French, similarly, one could express this by using the perfective Past Definite throughout : le confbencier se leva, toussa cinq fois, et dit . . • Russian too can use the Perfective here :2 dokladlik vstal, kasljanulpjat' raz i skazal . • . Secondly, a situation can be referred to by a habitual form without there being any iterativity at all. In a sentence like the Temple of Diana used to stand at Ephesus, there is no necessary implication that there were several occasions on each of which this temple stood at Ephesus, with interven­ ing periods when it did not ; with this particular sentence, the natural interpretation is precisely that the temple stood at Ephesus throughout a certain single period, without intermission. The same is true of the following sentences : Simon ttsed to believe in ghosts, Jones used to live in Patagonia, and of the Russian sentence ja ego znaval • I used to know him'.
Having clarified the difference between habituality and iterativity, we may now turn to the definition of habituality itself. The feature that is common to all habituals, whether or not they are also iterative, is that they describe a situation which is characteristic of an extended
1 In Slavonic linguistics, habitual forms are often referred to by the term ' iterative' (Russian mnogokratnYJ), e.g. Russian pivat', :rnavat ', the habitual counterparts ofpit' 'drink', Ilnat' 'know'. (In Russian , as opposed to some other Slavonic languages (e.g. Czech), special habitual forms are used rarely, at least in the written language ( Isal!enko 1 962 : 405-'7) ; they can always be replaced by the nonhabitual Imperfective.) In Lithuanian, the Imperfect is called batasis dazninis laikas, i.e. 'past iterative tense'.

Perfective and imperfective
period of time, so extended in fact that the situation referred to i. viewed not as an incidental property of the moment but, precisely, as a characteristic feature of a whole period. If the individual situation is one that can be protracted indefinitely in time, then there is no need for iterativity to be involved (as in the Temple of Diana used to stand at Ephesus), though equally it is not excluded (as in the policeman used to stand at the corner for two hours each day). If the situation is one that cannot be protracted, then the only reasonable interpretation will involve iterativity (as in the old professor used always to arevir late).
The problem of just what constitutes a characteristic feature of an
extended period of time, rather than an accidental situation, is concep­
tual, rather than linguistic, as can be illustrated using the example Sally used to throw stones at my window in the morning ; clearly if she threw stones two or three times only, the sentence is inappropriate, while it is appropriate if over a period of several years she threw stones at my window every morning ; but between these two extremes, it is more difficult to determine precisely how often, and with what degree of regularity (for surely a few mornings could pass without the stones), Sally would have to throw stones to make this an appropriate utterance. In other words, once we have decided that something constitutes a
characteristic situation, we are free to use an explicitly habitual form to
describe it, but the decision that a situation is characteristic is not in itself linguistic.
In discussions of the English Habitual Past (e.g. I used to sit for hours on end at their place), and likewise of the Russian Habitual Past (e.g. ja u nix si�ival celymi lasami),l it is often claimed that a further element of the meaning of these forms is that the situation described no longer holds, i.e. that, in the example quoted, I no longer sit for hours at their place. Thus it would be an implication of the sentence Bill used to belong to a subversive organisation that Bill no longer belongs to a subversive organisation. If this were an implication in the strict sense, then clearly any addition to the sentence that contradicted this implica­ tion would produce a contradiction. It is clearly an implication of Bill used to belong to a subversive organisation that Bill has at some time or other belonged to a subversive organisation, so that if someone says that Bill used to belong to a subversive organisation, but that he has
1 Cp. Isa�enko ( 1 962 : 4°7), whereja ego znaval and its English translation
I used to know him are said to imply that I no longer know him.
28

1 .2 Imperfective
never belonged to a subversive organisation, then he is evidently contradicting himself. We may therefore ask whether the putative implication of the Habitual Past, namely that the situation described no longer holds, is an implication in the strict sense. In fact, it turns out not to be, since one can quite reasonably say, without self-contradiction, in answer to a question whether or not Bill used to be a member of a subve rsive organisation : yes, he used to be a member of a subversive organisation, and he still is. Equally, one could answer : he used to be . . ., but I don't know 'whether or not he is now (as opposed to ""he used to be, but I don't know whether he ever has been). Equally, one could answer : he used to be, but is no longer a member, without being unduly repetitive (as opposed to he used to be, and has at some time been a member of a subversive orgatlisation, which is repetitive, and odd in that the second clause makes a weaker claim than the first one). Thus this cannot be an implication in the strict sense, since the putative implica­ tion can be cancelled by an explicit denial of it.
Suppose, however, that in reply to the question whether or not Bill used to be a member of a subversive organisation I answer simply yes, or yes, he used to be. Suppose moreover that I know that Bill still is a member of such an organisation. Then the questioner, once he were to discover that I had all this knowledge, could well accuse me of being misleading, if not of outright lying. In the absence of any disclaimer to the contrary, the sentence Bill used to be a member of a subversive organisation will be taken by the hearer as a commitment on the speaker's part that Bill is no longer a member. If Bill is still a member, indeed even if the speaker is simply unsure whether or not Bill is still a member, then the hearer can reasonably expect of the speaker that he will add some such disclaimer, otherwise the speaker is being deliberately mis­ leading. In recent linguistic work, the proposition Bill is no longer a member of a subversive organisation is often described as an implicature, rather than an implication, of Bill used to be a member of a subversive organisation. An implicature is thus weaker than an implication : an implicature of a sentence can be denied, in which case it does not hold, but if not denied, or suspended by an explicit remark from the speaker to the effect that he does not know whether or not it holds, then it will be taken to hold.1 With this English example one can compare the following Russian example, where again the implicature of the Habitual Past si-3ivala is cancelled by the following remark : ty, Veronika, casto

1 .2. I. I. Habitual and other aspectual values
Since any situation that can be protracted sufficiently in
time, or that can be iterated a sufficient number of times over a long enough period - and this means, in effect, almost any situation - can be expressed as a habitual, it follows that habituality is in principle com­ binable with various other semantic aspectual values, namely those appropriate to the kind of situation that is prolonged or iterated. If the formal structure of the language permits combination of the overt
markers of these various semantic aspectual values, then we can have
forms that give overt expression both to habituality and to some other aspectual value.
In English, for instance, the Habitual Aspect (used to construction) can combine freely with Progressive Aspect, to give such forms as used to be playing. Since progressiveness has not yet been dealt with in detail we may restrict ourselves for the moment to the following type of contrast between Progressive and non-Progressive, taking initially sentences in the Future Tense, where there is no special habitual form : (a) when I visit John, he'll recite his latest poems ; (b) when I visit John, he'll be reciting his latest poems. In the (a) sentence, with the non­ Progressive verb will recite in the main clause, the implication is that John's recital wiII occur after my arrival at his house, whereas in the (b) sentence the implication is that his recital will have started before my arrival, and will continue for at least part of the time that I am there. In this case, then, the Progressive indicates a situation (John's reciting his latest poems) that frames another situation (my arrival), while the non-Progressive excludes this interpretation. If we now put these same sentences into the Habitual Aspect, then precisely the same difference between Progressive and non-Progressive remains : (a) when I visitedJohn, he used to recite his latestpoems, indicating that on each occasion I went to John's, and only then did the poetry recital start, versus (b) when I visited John, he used to he reciting his latestpoems, which implies that on each occa­ sion I visited John and he was already engaged in reciting his poetry.1
1 This example is from Forsyth ( 1 970 : 1 69). I It is equally possible to use the Habitual in the subordinate clause, of
course : when I lISed to visit Johll, he used to recite/be reciting his latest poems. In English, the expression of habituality is always optional, since the nonhabitual forms do not exclude habituality
30

1 .2 Imperfective
In cases like this, where habituality does involve iterativity, then by combining habituality with other aspectual values it is possible to specify the aspectual nature of each individual occurrence of the situa­ tions which go together to make up the characteristic situation referred to by the habitual form. In Russian, for instance, particularly where the rest of the context indicates habituality, it is possible to use the Perfec­ tive with habitual meaning, expressing the iteration of a situation that would in itself be referred to by the Perfective, as in the example :1 ka�d>i raz mne kazalos', lto kto-to otkryl (Pfv.) okno, i S'lJe�ij veter 'corvaisja (Pfv.) v bol'niCnuju palatu ' each time it seemed to me as if someone (had) opened (Pfv.) the window and a fresh wind (had) rushed (Pfv.) into the hospital ward ' . Habituality is here established by the adverbial ka:dyj raz ' each time ', so that the Perfective/Imperfective opposition need not be used in the subordinate clause to establish habituality, but can be used to distinguish the aspect that would be assigned to a single occurrence of the appropriate situation. 'Vhere there is no other overt marker of habituality, it is possible in Russian to introduce such sentences by byvalo, literally ' it used to be ', which establishes habituality, then continuing with the aspectual values. that would be appropriate to describing each individual occurrence of the iterated situation.2
In Bulgarian, with its more profuse set of aspectual forms, use can be made here of the difference between the two oppositions Perfective! Imperfective and Aorist/lmperfect, the latter only in the past tense.s One of the functions of the Perfective Imperfect is to describe a situation that is iterative, and each of whose individual occurrences would itself be referred to by the Perfective (in fact, the Perfective Aorist), e.g.
stom puknele (Pfv. Imperfect) zorata, izkarvax ovcite navan ' as soon as dawn broke, I used to drive the sheep out '," where the Pe'rfective
1 This example is from Rassudova (1 968 : so). As Russian does not have a distinct Pluperfect, it is not clear out of context whether the English
gloss should use the Simple Past or the Pluperfect here. . a For examples, see section 4 . 1 . a Although Old Russian had both Aorist and Imperfect, these forms are
completely absent from the modern language. Of the other Slavonic languages that retain the Aorist and Imperfect, not all allow all four
combinations (Perfective Aorist, Imperfective Aorist, Perfective Im­
perfect, Imperfective Imperfect) : in Upper Sorbian, for instance, only the Perfective Aorist and the Imperfective Imperfect exist (Sewc 1 968 : 1 78), e.g. Perfective Aorist kupi 'he bought' , Imperfective Imp erfect kupowale 'he was buying, used to buy', but not ·kupile, ·kupowa. , Beaulieux and Mladenov ( 1 950: 335).
31

Perfective and imperfective
Imperfect puknefe, referring to the dawn breaking, both indicates that on each specific occasion I would have said, using the Perfective Aorist, stom pukna zorata, . . . ' as soon as dawn broke . . . " and that this was a habitual occurrence. At this point it is worth recapitulating briefly on the meaning of thc Bulgarian Imperfective Aorist and Perfective Imperfect, both of which combine perfectivity and imperfectivity, but are by no means synonymous. The Imperfective Aorist takes a situation which is described by an imperfective form (Imperfective), to give explicit reference to its internal complexity, and circumscribes the situation by giving it a perfective form (Aorist), i.e. the function of the Imperfective Aorist could he described as the perfective of an imper­ fective, or the Aorist of the Imperfective. The Perfective Imperfect, on the other hand, takes a situation which would in itself be described by a perfective form (Perfective), and then superimposes upon this imperfectivity, or rather one of the possible subtypes of imperfectivity, namely habituality, i.e. this is the imperfective (or, more specifically, the habitual) of a perfective, or the Imperfect of the Perfective. In other words, the difference between the Imperfective Aorist and the Perfective Imperfect derives from the different hierarchical ordering of the features of perfectivity and imperfectivity : in the former perfectivity dominates imperfectivity, in the latter impcrfectivity dominates perfectivity.
In Georgian, too, where the Perfective/Imperfective and Aorist/ Imperfect oppositions are formally distinct in the past tense, the Perfective Imperfect can be used to describe a habitual situation each of whose occurrences would in itself be described by a purely perfective form (Perfective Aorist), e.g. i lJacebma metad daigvianes! �amoi3axoda xolme xIirad salome, gamovidoda, miidebda fublze xels da gaixedavda gzaze ' those men are verily late I Salome used often to cry, go outside, put her hands to her eyes, and look towards the road ', where each of �amoi3axoda, gamovidoda, miidebda, and gaixedavda is Perfective Iinperfect.1
1 .2.2. Progressive In the present section we shall consider the meaning of
specifically progressive forms, such as English John is singing, Spanish Juan estd cantando, Italian Gianni sta cantando, Icelandic Jon er at! syngja, Irish td Sedn ag canadh. Although most of the illustrative examples will be taken from English, it should be noted from the outset
1 Vogt ( 1 97 1 : 1 8g-(0).
32

1 .2 Imperfective
that the English Progressive has, in comparison with progressive forms in many other languages, an unusually wide range. Some of the uses of the English Progressive that are not shared by progressive forms in other languages will be noted towards the end of this section. In some languages, the distinction between progressive and nonprogressive meaning by means of progressive and nonprogressive forms is obligatory, whereas in others the use of the specifically progressive forms is optional, i.e. the nonprogressive form does not exclude progressive meaning. English belongs to the first type, so that Progressive and non-Progressive are not in general interchangeable, nor can any one of these in general be replaced by the other ; in Spanish and Italian, on the other hand, it is normally possible to replace the Progressive by other forms, without implying nonprogressive meaning, so that corresponding to English John is singing Spanish may have either Juan estd cantando (Progressive) or Juan canta ; similarly Italian may have either Gianni sta cantando or Giamzi canta. French has a specifically progressive form, Jean est en train de chanter, but it is even less frequently used than the Spanish or Italian Progrcssives, so that John is singing will normally be translated i nto French as Jean chante.
Definitions of progressiveness found in some traditional grammars, along the lines of describing a situation in progress, often fail to bring out the difference between progressiveness and imperfectivity. For this reason, one of the main t asks of the present section will be to explain progressiveness in terms of how it differs from imperfectivity as a whole. Firstly, imperfectivity includes as a special case habituality, and a situation can be viewed as habitual without its being viewed as pro­ gressive, as with the English non-Progressive Habitual in John used to write poems (contrasting with the Progressive John used to be writing poems). In this respect, progressiveness is similar to continuousness, which is definable as imperfectivity that is not occasioned by habituality. As examples like John used to be writing poems show, progressiveness is not incompatible with habituality : a givt:n situation can be viewed both as habitual, and as progressive, i.e. each individual occurrence of the situation is presented as being progressive, and the sum total of all these occurrences is presented as being habitual (the habitual of a progressive). However, habituality on its own is not sufficient to require or allow the use of specifically progressive forms. In a language where progressive and nonprogressive forms are not distinguished, or are not distinguished obligatorily, such as French, then the nonprogressive
33

Perfecthe and imperfecti'vc
i mperfective forms will clearly have wider range than does the English non-Progressive. Thus, in French chaque jOllr d cinq heures le poete (:crivait Ull poeme may have the specifically imperfective Imperfect ecrivait here simply by virtue of habituality (i.e. ' each day at five 0' clock the poet wrote a poem '), or by virtue of the fact that the poem-writing situation was ongoing at five o'clock each day (i.e. ' each day at five o ' clock the poet was writing a poem ') . Other languages with distinct progressive forms are like English in this respect, as in Brazilian Portuguese todas as tardes, quando ele chegava (Imperfect) em casa, as criallras estavam brincando (Progressive) na rua ' every evening, when he returned ( Imperfect) home, the children were playing ( Progressive) in the street ' .1 Just as habituality does not determine progressiveness, so equally progressiveness does not determine habituality, i.c. a situation can be viewed as progressive without being viewed as habitual, as in John was writing a poem at five o'clock on the fifth of June 1975 A.D. (not *John used to write/used to be writing a poem at five o'clock on the fifth of June 1975 A . D . , since the specification of the one occasion on
which the situation took place excludes the possibility of habitual mean­
i ng). One might still conclude, however, that progressiveness is the same as continuousness, since continuousness is itself imperfectivity not determined by habituality.
If we continue comparing languages with special progressive forms and those without, then we find that even if we exclude sentences with habitual meaning, the range of progressiveness is still narrower than that of nonprogressive forms. Thus if we take the French sentence Jean savait qu'il parfait trop vite, with two Imperfects (savait, from savoir ' to know ' , and parlait, from parler ' speak ') , and assume a nonhabitual
interpretation, then it is possible for the second verb to appear in the
Progressive in English (indeed necessary that it should do so, in this interpretation of the French sentence) , but im:iJossible for the first verb
to appear in the Progressive : John knew/ *'was knowing that he was
speaking too quickly. If we look at other languages with specifically progressive forms, then the same situation holds, for instance in
Spanish (with the proviso that Spanish does not require overt specifica­
tion of progressive meaning, so that the nonprogressive form is also possible in the second clause) : Juan sabia ( Imperfect)/*estaba sabiendo ( Progressive) que hablaba ( Imperfect)/estaba hablando (Progressive) demasiado de prisa. Taking further examples of this kind, we find that
1 Thomas ( 1 969 : 202).
34

1 .2 Imperfective
verbs tend to divide into two disjoint (nonoverlapping) classes, those that can appear in the progressive forms, and those that cannot. More­ over, this distinction corresponds1 to that between stative and nonstative verbs. Thus we can give the general definition of progressiveness as the combination of progressive meaning and nonstative meaning. Naturally, then, stative verbs do not have progressive forms, since this would involve an internal contradiction between the stativity of the verb and the nonstativity essential to the progressive.
Given this characterisation of the progressive, one might expect different languages with progressive forms to agree on when these progressive forms can be used. Unfortunately, this is not the situation that we actually observe, since different languages in fact have different rules for determining when explicitly progressive forms can be used. In English and Spanish, for instance, the explicitly progressive form can be used in the sentences it is raining, estd lluviendo. In Icelandic, on the other hand, only the nonprogressive form is possible here : hannflaa rignir (not *hannfl>ao er ao rigna).2 In English, it is not in general possible to use progressive forms of verbs of inert perception like see, hear (though some exceptions will be noted below), i.e. not *1 am seeing you there under the table, or *you aren't hearing. In Portuguese, however, such forms are perfectly acceptable : estou te vendo Id embaixo da mesa; voce niio estd ouvindo.3 In these particular cases, the relevant factor seema to be that it is possible to view raining, seeing, hearing, etc. , either as
states or as non-states (dynamic situations) : different psychological theories differ as to just how active a process perception is, and there is
no reason to suppose that language presupposes the answer by uniquely classifying perception as either a state or a dynamic situation. Different
languages are free to choose, essentially as an arbitrary choice, whether
such verbs are classified as stative or not.4
1 More so in the other languages than in English, where many stative verbs also appear in the Progressive ; see further below.
I Einarsson ( 1 949 : 1 44). 3 Thomas ( 1 969 : 200-1). , This does not of course imply any necessary difference in cognition
between languages with stative verbs here and those with nonstative verbs. The explanation at this point may seem completely circular : progressiveness is defined in terms of stativity, but is then taken as sufficient evidence for classifying a given verb as stative or nonstative, i .e. Portuguese veT 'see' can occur in the Progressive because it is non­ stative, and it is nonstative because it can occur in the Progressive.
However, the argument depends on there being a sufficiently large class
35

Perfective and imperfecti've
So far, we have tacitly assumed that some verbs are stative, others
not, i.e. that this is a matter of classification of lexical items into disjoint (nonoverlapping) sets. In English, however, this is not the case : there
are many verbs that are treated sometimes as stative, sometimes as
nonstative, depending on the particular meaning they have in the given sentence. One such verb is the English verb be, so that in addition to Fred is silly we have Fred is being silly. The second of these can be paraphrased by Fred is acting in a silly manner, with the nonstative verb act, whereas this is not possible in the first case. The first sentence does not imply that Fred is doing anything silly at the moment, indeed he may be behaving quite sensibly at the moment, the only claim is that in general he is silly ; the second refers specifically to the way Fred is behaving at the moment, and makes no claim beyond this about his behaviour at other times. Other languages have a more strict lexical classification here : in Italian, for instance, essere • be ' is stative, and there is no Progressive for this verb, i.e. no "'sto essendo • I am being '. Even in English, lexical as opposed to semantic classification is to some extent involved, so that one finds synonymous or nearly synonymous constructions where in the one case the Progressive is possible, and in the other not, e.g. he is suffering from influenza and he is ( *is being) ill with influenza :1 in general suffer is a nonstative verb, and the Progressive is possible even when it is being used as synonymous with a stative verb. In English, the general rule seems to be that lexically stative verbs
can be used nonstatively and appear in the Progressive, while lexically
nonstative verbs do not lose their ability to be in the Progressive by
being used statively. Another nonstative use of stative verbs in English is in sentences like
I'm understanding more about quantum mechanics as each day goes by. Normally, the verb understand is stative, so that if someone asks whether what he is saying is comprehensible, it is possible to answer yes, I understand you, but not *yes, I'm understanding you. In the example given above with the Progressive of understand, however, the reference is not to an unchanging state of comprehension, the degree of compre­ hension being the same from one time-point to another, but rather of a change in the degree of understanding : on any given day, I understood
of clear cases where different languages do agree on the assignment of stativity. If the argument led to our classifying the translation equivalents of die, kill, and hit in some language as stative, then this would strongly suggest that the argument was wrong. 1 This example from Leech ( 1 97 1 : 20).

more about quantum mechanics than on any previous day. Thus the verb understand here refers not to a state, but to a developing process, whose individual phases are essentially different from one another.
Even if we allow for nonstative uses ofbasically stative verbs, however, there are still some uses of the English Progressive that are not accounted for. Thus such verbs as live, stand (in the sense of being in a certain position, rather than of assuming that position) are stative, and in most languages with distinct progressive forms may not appear in the pro­ gressive, while in E�glish their progressive forms are used, and contrast with the corresponding nonprogressive forms, as in I live at 6 Railway Cuttings and I'm living at 6 Railway Cuttings, or the Sphinx stands by the Nile and Mr. Smith is standing by the Nile. In such pairs, the non­ Progressive refers to a more Ol less permanent state of affairs, whereas the Progressive refers to a more temporary state. Thus if I say I live at 6 Railway Cuttings, I imply that this is my normal residence, whereas if I say I'm living at 6 Railway Cuttings, I imply that this is only a tem­ porary residence (for instance, while my Mayfair flat is being redecor­ ated). Similarly in the examples with stand: the Sphinx is a reasonably permanent fixture on the banks of the Nile, while we might expect Mr. Smith to be a temporary feature, standing there for a very limited period of time. Equally, the English Progressive can refer to a habitual situation that holds for a relatively limited period, as in we're going to the opera a lot these days, at that time I was working the night shift.
In addition to this use of the Progressive in English, the Progressive in English has a number of other specific uses that do not seem to fit under the general definition of progressiveness, for instance in I've only had six whiskies and already I'm seeing pink elephants (Progressive of the stative verb see, in the sense that I am only imagining things, in fact there are no pink elephants for me to see), or she's always buying far more vegetables than they can possibly eat (where the function of the Progressive seems simply to be to add greater emotive effect than would be achieved by the straightforward she always buys far more vegetables than they can possibly eat).1 Finally, some uses seem to be purely
1 Einarsson ( 1 949 : 1 44-5) notes that in Icelandic many verbs that normally do not occur in the Progressive can occur in the Progressive for emotive
effect, e.g. til "'vets ertu aif Ma a Asi?, literally 'why are you living at As?
with the sense of 'why on earth do you live at As?' (surprise or disgust) . J. Lyons suggests 10 me that the dynamic nature of the progressive may well account fo r its use to denote situations that are unexpected (i.e. not as tr.ey should be, cp. the use of the Progressive in English for temporary

idiosyncratic : thus while one can say either you look well or you're iooking well, with seem, as opposed to look, the Progressive is impos­ sible, i.e. only you seem well, not ·you're seeming well; similarly with sound in the appropriate sense : you sound hoarse, not "'you're sounding hoarse.
These examples demonstrate that in English the meaning of the
Progressive has extended well beyond the original definition of pro­
gressivity as the combination of continuous meaning and nonstativity. The question then arises whether the English Progressive should be given some other definition than the general linguistic definition of progressiveness, i.e. whether the meaning of the English Progressive is so extended that we should not speak of a basic progressive meaning with various subsidiary meanings, but rather of some more general basic meaning which includes both progressive meaning and the various other meanings that the English Progressive has. For instance, one might
suggest that the basic meaning of the English Progressive is to indicate
a contingent situation : this would subsume progressive meaning itself, and also the use of the Progressive to indicate a temporary (contingent) state, and its use to indicate a contingent habitual situation. This may well be the direction in which the English Progressive is developing diachronically, but does not give a completely adequate characterisation of its function in the modem language. As noted in the above discussion, there are several idiosyncrasies in the use of the English Progressive that seem, at least in the present state of research, to militate against a general meaning being able to account for every single use of this form. Moreover, although many stative verbs can be used in the Progressive to indicate a contingent state, it is by no means the case that all stative verbs can be used in this way.l For instance, the verb know does not allow formation of a Progressive, even with reference to a contingent state (John realised that there was no sugar before Mary came in, and forgot that there was no sugar almost as soon as she went out, so that when Mary was in the room he knew'·was knowing that there was no sugar),
states, or surprise), or indeed given as unreal (as with seeing pink elephants). While this suggestion is speculative, it may go some way towards providing an explanation for the apparently multifarious mean­
ings that the English Progressive has. See further footnote I, page 49.
1 For a classification of verbs into those that may occur in the Progressive and those that may not, see Leech ( 1 97 1 ; 1 4-27) ; the same framework is used in the briefer discussion of the Progressive in Quirk et al. ( 1 972 : 92-7).

even with reference to a surprising state (fancy that! you know/""al'e knowing all about quantum mechanics), even with reference to a counter­ factual state (so you know/ ""are knowing all about quantum mechanics, dol are you?), even with reference to a changing degree of knowledge (Ifind that I knowl ""am knowing more about quantum mechanics with each day that passes). Thus the extension of the English Progressive is more restricted than that of contingent state, although, as suggested above, it may well be that English is developing from a restricted use of the Progressive, always with progressive meaning, to this more extended meaning range, the present anomalies representing a midway stage between these two points.1
The diachronic development may be compared with that in the Celtic languages. In the present tense, Irish has distinct Progressive and non­ Progressive, i.e. the Progressive td se ag dui ' he is going ' has specifically progressive meaning. In Welsh, the form with the same etymological origin as the Irish Progressive has extended its range to cover nonpro­ gressive habitual meaning and stative meaning, as in y mae ef yn mynd ' he is going ' or ' he goes ', y mae efyn hoffi coffi ' he likes coffee ' ; the Simple Present remains only for a small number of stative verbs. In Scots Gaelic, this originally progressive form is now the only present for nearly all verbs, barring a few exceptions like the verb ' be ', so that tha e a' dol means either ' he is going ' or ' he goes '.
Although the -ing form is an essential ingredient of the English Progressive, in nonfinite constructions without the auxiliary be the -ing form does not necessarily have progressive meaning ; in fact, in such constructions it typically indicates only simultaneity (relative present time reference) with the situation of the main verb, as : knowing that Bill was on holiday, I burgled his house (i.e. as I knew, not ""as I u'as knowing) ; anyone knowing the whereabouts of John Smith is asked to communicate with his solicitor (i.e. anyone who knows, not ''''anyone who is knowing) ; FredCs) knowing the answer to the problem of life and der;th amazed the theology professor (i.e. the fact that Fl'ed knew, not ""the fact that Fred was knowing). Where the sense is progressive in such con­ structions, there is no overt indicator of progressive meaning in English, as in walking down the street, I met an old friend (not *being walking, despite while I was walking) ; the man walking down the street now is a

sociologist (not -the man being walking down the street now, despite the man who is walking down the street now).l
There is, however, one nonfinite construction where the -ing form does have specifically progressive force, namely after verbs of percep­ tion. Thus the difference between I saw the accused stab the victim and I saw the accused stabbing the victim is one of aspect : stab is non-Progres­ sive (in fact, it has perfective meaning, since the sense is that I witnessed the whole of the act of stabbing, and am not dividing the act up into separate beginning, middle and end, but presenting it as a single complete whole) ; stabbing is Progressive (it is not necessary for me to have witnessed the beginning and/or end of the process, but only the middle, at least this is all I am alluding to). Similarly : I watched Fred sit for a whole hour doing nothing, where Fred's sitting, no matter how long it lasted, is presented as a single complete situation, in contrast to I watched Fred silting doing nothing.
1 Seuren ( 1 974 : 4) notes that some derived nominals have an overt aspec­ tual distinction, e.g. thieving (imperfective meaning) versus theft (per­ fective meaning), cp. also the plural thefts. While there is indeed aspectual differentiation in some such pairs, the distinction is not that between progressive and nonprogressive meaning.

2.0. In chapter I, we considered oppositions between perfective and imperfective forms, and between habitual and continuous forms, largely irrespective of the particular lexical items exhibiting the con­ trasts. The main exceptions to this generalisation are the discussion in section I . I .2 of combinations of perfectivity with lexical or other specification of the internal structure of a situation, and the discussion of the progressive in section 1 .2.2 where it was noted that progressive­ ness is intimately bound up with the inherent nonstativity of the situation being described. In the present chapter we shall look in some­ what more detail at inherent aspectual (i.e. semantic aspectual) pro­ perties of various classes of lexical items, and see how these interact with other aspectual oppositions, either prohibiting certain combinations, or severely restricting their meaning.
2. 1 . Punctual and durative1 I n section 1 . 1 .2, we noted that it is quite possible to have
perfective forms of verbs describing situations that must inherently last for a certain period of time, as in Russian ja postojal (Pfv.) tam cas ' I stood there for an hour '. We may therefore make a distinction between imperfectivity and durativity, where imperfectivity means viewing a situation with regard to its internal structure (duration, phasal sequen­ ces), and durativity simply refers to the fact that the given situation lasts for a certain period of time (or at least, is conceived of as lasting for a certain period of time) ; the verb postojal in the example quoted above is thus durative, although not imperfective. The opposite of durativity
1 In some terminological systems, the terms 'punctual' and 'durative' are used in essentially the same sense as our terms 'perfective' and 'con­ tinuous', respectively. In the present work, the two sets of terms are not equivalent, as will bt:come apparent in the discussion below.
41

Aspect and inherent meaning
is punctuality, which thus means the quality of a situation that does not last in time (is not conceived of as lasting in time), one that takes place momentarily. It should be noted that the crucial point here is that punctual situations do not have any duration, not even duration of a very short period. Thus a punctual situation, by definition, has no internal structure, and in a language with separate imperfective forms to indicate reference to the internal structure of a situation, then clearly punctuality and imperfectivity will be incompatible.
So far, we have rather taken for granted that there are punctual situations, but we must now investigate in further detail the precise range of possibilities in this area. One verb which is often quoted as an example of a punctual verb is the English verb cough, and its translation equivalents in other languages, referring to a single cough, rather than a series of coughs.1 If this were strictly true, then the Progressive, which has imperfective meaning, would be impossible with cough (on the interpretation when there is only one cough), i.e. he was coughing would be inappropriate in referring to a situation where he gave a single cough i the same would be true of French il toussait (Imperfect), for instance. The only interpretation possible for such a sentence would be that the reference is to a series of coughs, since a series of coughs, even if there are only two coughs, is clearly a durative situation. At this stage, we may introduce the terms • semelfactive ' to refer to a situation that takes place once and once only (e.g. one single cough),2 and • iterative ' to refer to a situation that is repeated (e.g. a series of coughs). Thus the inherent punctuality of cough would restrict the range of interpretations that can be given to imperfective forms of this verb.
Objections have been raised to this analysis of verbs like cough, on the grounds that in fact the single act of coughing, for instance, is not punc­ tual in the strict sense, but rather refers to a situation that lasts for a very short time. For as long as we are in real time, it is unlikely that anyone would want to refer to the duration or successive phases that make up this situation, but this restriction can be lifted by, for instance,
1 Strictly speaking, it is the situation, rather than the verb, that is punctual, though for convenience we shall retain the traditional practice of using the term 'punctual verb' for a verb referring to a punctual situation.
S This is in accordance with the etymology of the term (Latin semel 'once'), but differs somewhat from its use in, for instance, Slavonic linguistics,
where the verb kaIljanut ' 'cough' is described as semelfactive, even when
it is used in a sentence like on kaIljanul pjat ' raz 'he coughed five times', where the situation is clearly iterative.

2.1 Punctual and durative
imagining a situation where someone is commenting on a slowed down film which incorporates someone's single cough, as for instance in an anatomy lecture : here, it would be quite appropriate for the lecturer to comment on the relevant part of the film and now the subject is coughing, even in referring to a single cough, since the single act of coughing has now been extended, and is clearly durative, in that the relevant film sequence lasts for a certain period of time. The question would then arise as to whether there are any kinds of situation which, even if slowed down, would have to be strictly punctual. Clearly coughing would not enter this category, and it is in fact difficult to think of clear examples that would. One possible example would be a situation of the sort described in the sentence John reached the summit of the mountain : here there is one moment when John had not yet reached the summit, and another moment when he had, with no time intervening between the two. No matter how slowly one presented the film of John's moun· taineering exploits, the interval between these two moments would always be zero, and it would always be inappropriate to say at this point, John is reaching the summit. Imperfective forms of reach the summit would then only have iterative meaning, as in the soldiers are already reaching the summit (i.e. some have already reached it, some have not yet reached it, there being several individual acts of reaching the summit).1
But even with verbs like cough, we find that some languages do have a special class of verbs, formally marked, which refer to situations that under normal circumstances cannot be viewed as having any duration, in the absence of iterativity.2 In Russian, for instance, there is a large class of verbs with the suffix -nu, all Perfective, without strict aspectual partners in the Imperfective Aspect, such as kasljanut' ' cough ', blesnut' ' flash ' .3 In Hungarian, too, there are several suffixes which serve in general to mark verbs of this class, such as zorren ' knock, give a knock ' (cf. zorog ' knock ' (possibly repeatedly».' Thus a number of languages

Aspect and inherent meaning
do recognise a class of verbs that under normal circumstances can only refer to punctual situations (or iteration of punctual acts), suggesting that punctuality is a valid linguistic category, notwithstanding the apparent difficulties caused by recent technology (in particular, slowing down of films) in distinguishing the precise range of punctual situations.
2.2. Telic and atelic1 We may start the discussion of this section by contrasting
some of the semantic aspectual properties of the situations described by the two sentences John is singing and John is making a chair. Both refer to durative situations, since both singing and making a chair are situa­ tions that can, indeed must, be conceived of as lasting a certain amount of time ; moreover, it is possible for both of these situations to last for a short or for a long time, depending, for instance, on John's stamina when it comes to singing, and the speed with which he makes chairs. However, there is an important difference between these two types of situations with regard to their internal structure. In the second example, there comes eventually a point at which John completes the action of making a chair, the chair is ready, and at this point the situation described by make a chair must of necessity come to an end ; moreover, until this point is reached, the situation described by make a chair cannot come to an end, but can only be broken off part way through. This is not true of the situation described by John is singing : John can stop singing at any point, and it will still be true that he has sung, even if he has not completed the song or songs he set out to sing. Thus the situation described by make a chair has built into it a terminal point, namely that point at which the chair is complete, when it automatically termin­ ates ; the situation described by sing has no such terminal point, and can be protracted indefinitely or broken off at any point. Situations like that described by make a chair are called telic, those like that described by sing atelic. The telic nature of a situation can often be tested in the following way : if a sentence referring to this situation in a form with imperfective meaning (such as the English Progressive) implies the sentence referring to the same situation in a form with perfect meaning (such as the English Perfect), then the situation is atelic ; otherwise it is telic. Thus from John is singing one can deduce John has sung, but from
1 The term 'telic situation' corresponds to the term 'accomplishment' used, for instance, by Vendler ( 1 967 : 1 02). The term 'telic' was apparently introduced by Garey ( 1 957) (cp. Ancient Greek telos 'end').
44

2.2 Telic and atelic
John is making a chair one cannot deduce John has made a chair.l Thus a telic situation is one that involves a process that leads up to a well­ defined terminal point, beyond which the process cannot continue.
In the preceding paragraph, we spoke of telic situations, rather than telic verbs. At first sight, it might seem that we could call verbs that refer to telic situations telic, those that refer to atelic situations atelic ; in fact, the picture is not quite so simple. If it were, then we could, for instance, call drown a telic verb (drowning is a process that necessarily comes to an end when the animal drowning dies), and sing an atelic verb. However, situations are not described by verbs alone, but rather by the verb together with its arguments (subject and objects).2 Thus although John is singing describes an atelic situation, the sentence John is singing a song describes a telic situation, since this situation has a well­ defined terminal point, namely when John comes to the end of the song in question. John is singing songs is again atelic, whereas John is singing jive songs is again telic.3 Similarly, although John is drowning describes a telic situation, the sentence cats drown if you put them in deep water is not telic, since it refers to an ongoing tendency for cats to drown, a tendency that can go on indefinitely, irrespective of the number of cats who have completed their act of drowning. Moreover, provided an appropriate context is provided, many sentences that would otherwise
1 Compare the discussion in Klein ( 1 974 : 1 06-,]), with the examples : Si quelqu'un jouait, et tout en jouant a ete interrompu, est-ee qu'il a joui? Oui, it a joue ' If someone was playing, and while playing was interrupted, has he played? Yes, he has played' (atelic), versus : Si quelqu'un se noyait, et tout en SI! noyant a eU interrompu, est-ee qu'il s'est noye? Non, il ne s'est pas noye 'If someone was drowning, and while drowning was inter­ rupted, has he drowned? No, he hasn't drowned' (telic).
I See, for further discussion, Dowty ( 1 972), Verkuyl { 1 972}. Some of the sentences that give difficulty to Vendler ( 1967 : 104) in his discussion of related problems seem to stem from the failure to realise that subjects, as well as objects, must be included here. More generally, although aspect, and tense and mood, are usually indicated in the verbal morphology, they do not so much characterise the verb itself as the whole of the sentence, including subjects and objects.
8 Actually, it is difficult to think of sentences which must be interpreted as describing a telic situation. Thus if John were to repeat the same song incessantly, then evenJohn is singing a song would be atelic. The sentence John is killing Mary might seem to describe a necessary telic situation, which must come to an end when Mary is dead, but even this is so o1lly given our knowledge about the real world, where dead people do not come to life again, thus forestalling the possibilil-Y that they might be killed iteratively. One could easily imagine an advance in surgery that would make an atelic interpretation of John is killing Mary;perfectly reasonable.

Aspect and inhere1lt meaning
be taken to describe atelic situations can be given a telic interpretation. Imagine, for instance, a singing class where each of the pupils is required to sing a certain set passage ; then the verb sing on its own, in this con­ text, may be taken to mean ' sing the set passage ', so that from John is singing it will not follow that John has sung. Similarly, in a classroom situation where the pupils are taking turns at reading, John has read will have the specific interpretation that he has completed his turn.l However, although it is difficult to find sentences that are unambiguously telic or atelic, this does not affect the general semantic distinction made between tcIic and atelic situations.
The particular importance of the telic/atelic distinction for the study of aspect is that, when combined with the perfective/imperfective opposition, the semantic range of telic verbs is restricted considerably, so that certain logical deductions can be made from the aspect of a sentence referring to a tcIic situation that cannot be made from the aspect of a sentence referring to an atelic situation. For instance, a per­ fective form referring to a telic situation implies attainment of the terminal point of that situation,2 as in Russian on sdelal (Pfv.) stul, French il fit (Past Definite)/a fait (Perfect) une chaise ' he made/has made a chair ', both of which imply that the chair was completed. The imperfective forms carry no such implication, and imply rather that the chair had not been completed at the time referred to : ilfaisait (Imper­ fect) une chaise, he was making (Progressive) a chair.3
In some languages, it is possible to derive verbs referring to specific­ ally telic situations from verbs that do not necessarily refer to telic situations, usually as part of the derivational morphology. In German, for instance, there is a contrast between kiimpfe1l ' fight ' (possibly with­ out achieving anything) and erkiimpfe1l ' achieve by means of a fight ', the latter referring to a process of fighting that leads up to some terminal point. A similar difference exists betwecn essen and the specifically telic aufesse1l, and bctween the English glosses thereto : eat and eat up. In Latin, the same relation obtains between facere ' make, do ' and its
1 Thus Dowty ( 1 972 : 28) comments : 'I have not been able to find a single activity verb which cannot have an accomplishment [i.e. telic - D.C.] sense in at least some special context '.
• Such examples may have given rise to the widespread view that per­ fectivity indicates completedness.
a In Russian, the Imperfective can also be occasioned by the unmarked nature of the Imperfective, rather than by specifically imperfective mean­ ing ; see chapter 6. Thus, strictly, no implication as to the completion or noncompletion of the chair can be drawn from on delal stul.

2.2 Telic and atelic
derivative conficere ' complete '.1 Thus the German sentence die Partisa­ nen haben fur die Freiheit ihres Landes gekiimpft ' the partisans have fought for the freedom of their country ' does not imply that their fight was successful, whereas die Partisanen haben die Freiheit ihres Landes erkiimpft does.
In expressions referring to telic situations it is important that there should be both a process leading up to the terminal point as well as the terminal point. Thus the example quoted above, John reached the summit, is not telic, since one cannot speak of the process leading up to John's reaching the summit by saying John is reaching the summit.2 In general, it is easy to distinguish telic situations from those Vendier calls achievements, though there are some difficult cases. With a telic situation, it is possible to use a verbal form with imperfective meaning, the implication being that at the time in question the terminal point had not yet been reached ; indeed, it is possible to state explicitly that the terminal point was never reached, as in Mary was singing a song when she died. Achievements preclude the use of specifically imperfective forms, so that we do not have "'John was reaching the summit when he died, but only, for instance, John had almost reached the summit when he died. A more difficult case is the English verb die.3 Although this refers to a punctual situation, yet it is still possible to say John is dying, which refers to the process leading up to John's death, and might therefore seem to make die a telic verb. However, it seems odd to say ?John was dying, but the discovery of a new medicine led to his recovery. In other words, although John was dying implies that at the time in question he was not yet dead, yet still it seems to imply that he did die (later) ; similarly, John is dying holds out little if any hope for his recovery, unlike Mary is singing a song, where it is still possible that she will be prevented from completing the song. This suggests that a new class of situations will have to be recognised, referring to a punctual event and the immediately preceding process, in the sense that the process
1 Strictly, these verbs involve predications, rather than situations, which are telic, since the addition of an indefinitely plural subject, for instance, means that the whole situation is not telic, as in some children eat their
food up ; cp. the example cats drown . . . above.
I Vendler ( 1 967 : 1 02-3) uses the term 'achievement' for situations like John reached the summit : the reference is to the end-point of a process only, which is why, as we noted in section 2. 1 , such situations are punctual in the strictest sense of the term.
3 Vendler ( 1 967 : 1 07) assigns die without reservation to the class of achievements.
47

Aspect and inherent meaning
preceding the event is so intimately bound up with the event that once the process is under way the event cannot be prevented from occurring. It is interesting that Russian differs from English here, since in Russian it is quite possible to say Kolja umiral (Ipfv.), no ne umer (Pfv.) ' Kolya was dying, but didn't die ' ; in other words umirat'/umeret' ' die ' in Russian is telic, referring to the process leading up to death, whether or not death is reached. Similarly, Russian on ugovarival (Ipfv.) menja, no ne ugovoril (Pfv.) does not really translate into good English as ' he was persuading me, but didn't persuade me ' ; Russian ugovarivat'/ugovorit' ' persuade ' is telic, whereas English persuade can only refer to the process leading up to the moment of persuasion if that process is in fact successful.
2. 3 . State and dynamic situation The distinction between states and dynamic situationsl is
one that seems reasonably clear intuitively, and in practice one finds a large measure of agreement between individuals who a re asked to classify situations as static or dynamic, and similarly between languages that have overt correlates of the static/dynamic distinction, although there are some instances of disagreement, as was noted in section 1 .2.2 on the progressive. The present section will attempt to clarify the distinction between states and dynamic situations, and also the meaning of certain related terms, such as ' event ' and ' process '.2
We may approach the problem by considering a situation that is extended in time, i.e. restricting ourselves initially to durative situations. The term ' phase ' will be used to refer to a situation at any given point of time in its duration.3 As examples to work with, we may consider first of all the verb know, referring to a state, and the verb run, referring to a dynamic situation. One difference between the situations referred
1 In other discussions of this distinction, the opposition is often made using the terms 'state' and 'action'. Some linguists, however, use the term 'action' in a more restricted sense, for a dynamic situation that requires the involvement of an agent ; thus the stone is rolling down the hill would not be an action in this narrower sense of the term. To avoid possible confusion, the more explicit term 'dynamic situation' is used here.
I For further discussion, see Lyons ( 1 963 : 1 1 1-1 9), Lakoff ( 1 966), VendIer ( 1 967 : 1 07-2 1).
I This is a slight extension of the dictionary definition of 'phase', which usually restricts the term to a changing or developing process at different points of time.

2.3 State and dynamic situation
to by these two verbs is in the relation between different phases of the situation : in the case of know, all phases of the situation John knows where I live are identical ; whichever point of time we choose to cut in on the situation of John's knowledge, we shall find exactly the same situation. With run, however, this is not so : if we say John is running, then different phases of the situation will be very different : at one moment John will have one foot on the ground, at anothermomentneither foot will be on the ground, and so on. Thus know, on the one hand, in­ volves no change, whereasrun involves necessarily change. Thisgives a first approximation of the characterisation of state versus dynamic situation.
However, there are still some states and non-states which this dichotomy does not correctly characterise. The state of standing (i.e. being in a standing position) may involve no change, but equally it does not exclude the possibility of change : thus I can say of one of my books that it stands on such-and-such a shelf even if its position on the shelf changes (e.g. if I move it every now and again). One might therefore suggest that dynamic situations involve necessarily change, whereas states are situations that may or may not involve change. But there are still difficult cases. In the situation referred to by the sentence the oscilloscope is emitting a pure tone at 300 cycles per second, we have a dynamic situation that does not involve any necessary change, at least not any change that would be apparent to someone unacquainted with the operation of the oscilloscope, although this would not affect his conception of the dynamic nature of the situation. These exceptional cases can in fact be brought under a slightly modified characterisation of the difference between states and dynamic situations. With a state, unless something happens to change that state, then the state will con­ tinue : this applies equally to standing and to knowing. With a dynamic situation, on the other hand, the situation will only continue if it is continually subject to a new input of energy : this applies equally to running and to emitting a pure tone, since if John stops putting any effort into running, he will come to a stop, and if the oscilloscope is cut off from its source of power it will no longer emit sound. To remain in a state requires no effort, whereas to remain in a dynamic situation does require effort, whether from inside (in which case we have an agentive in­ terpretation, e.g. John is running), or from outside (in which case we have a nonagentive interpretation, e.g. the oscilloscope is emitting a pure tone).!
1 Developing further the speculative suggestion of footnote I , page 37 we might further hypothesise that the use of the Progressive in English,

Aspect and inherent meaning
Since punctual situations automatically involve a change of state, they are automatically dynamic : there can be no such thing as a punctual state.
We now have a definition of state versus dynamic situation which is independent of any language-particular distinction, although we would expect language-particular distinctions that relate to this distinction (such as progressiveness as a correlate of the state/dynamic situation distinction) to dichotomise situations in more or less the same way from one language to another, with the exception of situations that can be viewed, intuitively, as either states or dynamic situations, i.e. where there might be disagreement or doubt as to whether or not the situation in question will stop unless continuously renewed.
So far, we have been referring to states as something ongoing, i.e. looking at states from within. Of course, states can also start, and cease. The start or end of a state is dynamic, since for a state to be started or stopped something must come about to bring about the change into or out of this state ; this follows from the definition of state given above. Thus when, in section I . I , we noted that states can be referred to by forms with perfective meaning, then the form describing the state here refers not only to the state, but also to its inception and termination. Thus Russian ja postojal (Pfv.) tam cas ' I stood there for an hour ', Ancient Greek ebasi/euse (Aorist) deka ell ' he reigned for ten years ' refer not only to the state obtaining at a given time, but also to its inception and termination, i.e. do include a dynamic element. In many languages stative verbs do not have forms with perfective meaning,1 while in many other languages this applies to a large number of stative verbs.2 Thus the combination of perfectivity and stativity can only have a rather restricted semantic range - reference to a state with its
typically restricted to dynamic situations, to describe contingent and make-believe states derives from a metaphorical extension of the require­ ment inherent in dynamic situations that they be subject to a continuing input of energy : since a contingent state is a state that is not the normal state of things, it is more difficult to maintain than an absolute state, which is the normal state of things, and to which things would be expected to revert, other things being equal. Similarly, a habitual (characteristic) situation , being a normal state of affairs, will not require the dynamic progressive form (unless the progressive is used as appropriate for each individual occurrence of a repeated series of situations making up the habitual situation), although a contingent (temporary) habitual, like a contingent state, is more likely to be in the progressive form. 1 See, for instance, the Igbo and Yoruba examples in section 4.5. 2 See, for instance, the Georgian examples in section 6.3.
so

2.3 State and dynamic situation inception and termination - and some languages do not even allow of this interpretation. Given the naturalness of the combination of stativity and imperfectivity, it is easy to see why many languages have a special form to express progressive meaning : progressive meaning combines nonstativity with continuous meaning, and in referring to non-states the distinction between continuous and perfective meaning is more important than in referring to states, which are typically continuous ; thus, if a formal distinction is to be made anywhere, it is more logical for it to be made within descriptions of dynamic situations than within descriptions of static situations.
In the linguistic literature, one also comes across the terms ' event ' and ' process ' referring to situations. Both refer to dynamic situations ; ' process ' refers to the internal structure of a dynamic situation (there are thus no punctual processes), while ' event ' refers to a dynamic situation as a single complete whole. Thus the term ' process ' means a dynamic situation viewed imperfectively, and the term ' event ' means a dynamic situation viewed perfectively.

Perfect
3 .0. Aspect, as we have been concerned with it hitherto, has been concerned with different ways of representing the internal temporal constitution of a situation. The perfect is rather different from these aspects, since it tells us nothing directly about the situation in itself,! but rather relates some state to a preceding situation. As a preliminary illustration of this, to be amplified and modified in the detailed discus­ sion below, we may contrast the English sentences I have lost (Perfect) mypenknife and I lost (non-Perfect) my penknife. One possible difference between these two is that with the Perfect, there is an implication that the penknife is still lost, whereas with the non-Perfect there is no such implication. More generally, the perfect indicates the continuing present relevance of a past situation. This difference between the perfect and the other aspects has led many linguists to doubt whether the perfect should be considered an aspect at all,2 However, given the traditional terminology in which the perfect is listed as an aspect, it seems most convenient to deal with the perfect in a book on aspect, while bearing in mind continually that it is an aspect in a rather different sense from the other aspects treated so far.
One way in which the perfect differs from the other aspects that we have examined is that it expresses a relation between two time-points, on the one hand the time of the state resulting from a prior situation, and on the other the time of that prior situation. Thus the present perfect, for instance, such as English I have eaten, partakes of both the present and the past. In some languages this dual role has syntactic and
1 In those languages where the perfect is combinable with other aspectual categories, then these other categories may give information about the situation per se, as in the English Progressive John has been feeding the goldfish.
• A discussion of the background to this problem is given by Maslov ( 1 962b : 30-2).

3 .0 Perfect
morphological repercussions. Thus in Ancient Greek, for instance, the Perfect, although referring to a past situation, is still treated as a primary (i.e. non-past) tense for the purpose of determining the sequence of tenses ; even in Latin, where the so-called Perfect covers both perfect meaning and nonperfect past time reference, there is a distinction in sequence of tense, in that the Perfect with perfect meaning is usually treated as a primary tense, whereas the Perfect with nonperfect past time reference is not.1 In some languages, the form of the perfect incorporates formal expression of the two times referred to, e.g. present and past in the present perfect j for further discussion, see section 5.2.2•0•
It should be borne in mind that the present perfect (often simply called the perfect) is only one of the possible tenses of the perfect aspect, the one that expresses a relation between present state and past situation. In other tenses we find, for instance, a past perfect (pluperfect), e.g. John had eaten thefish, expressing a relation between a past state and an even earlier situation ; and a future perfect, e.g. John will have eaten the fish, expressing a relation between a future state and a situation prior to it, although there is no other specification of the absolute time of that prior action, which may be past, present, or future (e.g. I don't know if John has eaten thefish yet, but he will have done so by the time you return, where all that is said about the time of John's eating the fish is that it will precede some other future action, namely your returning).
In discussing the perfect, it is important not to be misled into thinking that every form that is labelled • Perfect ' in the grammar-book in fact expresses perfect meaning. Thus in Latin, for instance, as noted above, the so-called Perfect in fact covers both perfect and nonperfect meaning. The same is true of the Perfect (Compound Past) in many Romance languages, especially in their spoken forms, such as French, Italian, Romanian, though not Spanish. In some (especially southern) varieties of German the so-called Perfect has extended its sphere to take over from the Simple Past, i.e. it has in fact become the only Past Tense, quite irrespective of aspect. Most of the examples in this chapter will be from English, where there is a clear formal distinction between forms with perfect meaning, and those With nonperfect meaning.2
1 Goodwin ( 1 894 : 91, 27 1 ) ; Gildersleeve and Lodge ( 1 895 : 3 14-1 9) ; by sequence of tenses, the tense of the verb in certain subordinate clauses is determined or restricted by the tense of the verb in the main clause.
I It should be noted, however, that there is some variation within Eng­ lish as to the precise delimitation between Perfect and non-Perfect
53

Perfect
We may note one diagnostic characteristic of the English Perfect, which will prove useful in the ensuing discussion. This is that, in English, the Perfect may not be used together with specification of the time of the past situation, i.e. one cannot say I have got up atfive o'clock this morning, because the specific reference to the point of time at fi've o'clock this morning is incompatible with the English Perfect. It is not specification of time as such that is excluded, since one can specify the time within which the past situation held, provided the time includes the present, e.g. I have seen Fred today, or even I have seen Fred this morning provided it is still morning at the time of speaking.1 The experiential perfect, discussed in section 3. 1.2 below, also admits of specification of a point of time, as in I have (on some occasion in the past) got up at five o'clock, though here five o'clock refers not to some specific instance of ' five o'clock ', but rather ranges over all possible five 0'clocks ; one could not, for instance, say I have got up atfive o'clock on the sixth ofJune 1975 A .D., even as an experiential perfect. It is not clear that the mutual exclusiveness of the perfect and specification of the time of a situation is a necessary state of affairs in a language. In Spanish, for instance, where the Perfect does have specifically perfect meaning, it is still possible to specify exactly the time of the past situation, as in me he levantado a las cinco ' I got up at five o'clock ' (in reply to a question why I am looking so tired), Gustavo Ferrdn ha muerto ayer . . . se ha estrellado anoche en los montes denieve • Gustavo Femin died yesterday . . . he crashed last night on the snow-covered mountains ', where the Perfect would be impossible in the English glosses.2 In Russian, where there is a distinct Perfect in the passive (section 4.6), time specification is still possible with this Perfect, e.g. dom postroen (Perfect) v proslom godu • the house was built last year ', which implies that the house is still standing, unlike d011l byl postroen (non-Perfect) v proslom godu.3 Similarly, temporal specification is acceptable in English, provided it is
forms. In particular, American English overall shows a greater preference for the non-Perfect, in cases where British English would prefer or require the Perfect. 1 There may be a certain amount of individual variation here : Leech
( 1 97 1 : 40-1 ) notes that some English speakers allow I've been to the
dentist this mornillg, even if said in the afternoon. The Perfect in I have recently learned that Bill is leaving is quite generally acceptable, although recently here refers to some point of time in the past. See further section 3 . 1 .4 on the recent past. a Stevenson ( 1 970 : 62). • Isa�enko ( 1 962 : 45 1).

3 .0 Perfect

added as an afterthought to a sentence with a Perfect verb, such as I have been to Birmingham, last week in fact, or as a reply to a question, such as Have you finished your article on Tibetan morphology? - Yes, last 'week. At any rate, the restriction on the occurrence of temporal adverbs in English does provide a useful heuristic device for identifying the Perfect in that language.1
The reason why the availability of this test is so important for English is that in English, in certain nonfinite verbal constructions especially, the Perfect form (have plus Past Participle) does not necessarily have perfect meaning. Thus some of the following sentences with participial and infinitival constructions will be paraphrasable with finite verbs in the Perfect, others with finite verbs in the Simple Past :
Having eaten a three-course dinner, Bill is no longer hungry (As he has eaten a three-course dinner, Bill is no longer hungry).
Having been in Berlin before the War, Bill is surprised at the many changes (As he was in Berlin before the War, Bill is sur­ prised at the many changes).
Bill may already have finished his dinner (It is possible that Bill has already finished his dinner).
Bill may have been in Berlin before the War (It is possible that Bill was in Berlin before the War).
The judge believes Bill to have told several lies already (The judge believes that Bill has told several lies already).
The security officer believes Bill to have been in Berlin before the War (The security officer believes that Bill was in Berlin before the War).
In such examples, even with specification of relative past time, the use of the Perfect form is possible, indeed with such nonfinite verbal forms there is no other way of indicating past time, so that in such constructions the distinction between perfect meaning and relative past time reference is not made overtly (is neutralised).
1 The restriction against the combination of Perfect and time specification may well be part of a more general restriction against the use of the Perfect in referring to a specific occasion. The occasion may be specified by the use of an adverb of time, but it may also be presupposed by the speaker to be knowledge common to both speaker and hearer. Thus if I see you with a broken arm, then I can ask how did you break your arm ? with the non-Perfect form, since I am taking as already given the fact that you broke your arm, and am eliciting further information about the incident. Similarly, while a past situation can be introduced into a discourse by means of the Perfect, it is thereafter common knowledge shared by speaker and hearer and will be referred to by non-Perfect forms, as in the exchange : A. I've broken my arm. B. Did you break it today ?

Perfect
A similar loss of overt semantic distinction emerges if we examine in more detail the English Pluperfect. A sentence like Bill had arrived at six o'clock is ambiguous. On the one hand, it can mean that six o'clock is the vantage point in the past from which we are observing the results of earlier events, one of which was Bill's arrival ; Bill may have arrived at five o'clock, though he was still there at six. This is the strict perfect­ in-the-past, i.e. denotes a past state which results from an even earlier situation ; at six o'clock we would have said Bill has arrived. On the other hand, it is also possible to interpret the sentence in question as saying that six o'clock was the time of Bill's arrival. In this case we are simply stating that Bill's arrival preceded some other past situation (past-in-the-past), without there being any relation between Bill's arrival and any state in existence at the time of this later situation ; e.g. Bill had arrived at six o'clock and had left again at seven; the inspector did not get there until eight. The same is true of the Future Perfect, which can be either a perfect-in-the-future, or a past-in-the-future.
3 . 1 . Types of perfect So far, we have given a general definition of the perfect as the
continuing relevance of a previous situation. In this section, we shall examine some more specific manifestations of this general property. Not all languages that have forms with perfect meaning have the full range of the meanings listed below, while in some languages there are distinct forms for some of these meanings. The particular types of perfect discussed below are the perfect of result, the experiential perfect, the perfect of persistent situation, and the perfect of recent past.
3 . 1 . 1 . Perfect of result In the perfect of result, a present state is referred to as being
the result of some past situation : this is one of the clearest manifestations of the present relevance of a past situation. Thus one of the possible differences between John has arrived and John arrived is that the former indicates persistence of the result of John's arrival, i.e. that he is still here, whereas the second does not. In answer to the question is John here yet? a perfectly reasonable reply would be yes, he has arrived, but not yes, he arrived.1 Likewise, the sentence I have had a bath implies that the results of my bath (that I am clean, that I don't immediately
1 The reply yes, lie arrived at ten o'clock is possible, since English requires
non-Perfect forms where there is overt time specification.

3 . 1 Types ofperfect
need another bath) still hold. Of course, this sentence only says that the results do still hold, without giving any indication of the conceptual background to my making this statement : thus Cleopatra may only have uttered such a statement if she had had a bath within the last hour, while for a medieval monk the relevant time-span may rather have been within the last year ; in either case, the Perfect is appropriate, since it makes no claims about what constitutes a continuing result, only that there is some continuing result.
The nature of the perfect of result can be examined by comparing translation equivalents across languages where the one uses the Perfect (or, in the absence of a distinct perfect, a past tense) and the other uses the Present of a stative verb (or adjective), i.e. one language expresses this as a (state resulting from a) past action, while the other just expresses it as a present state without any overt mention of how this state came about. Most of the examples seem to concern contrasts where English has a stative adjective or verb, while some other language has a Perfect or other past tense, so that it may be that English overall tends towards the use of the stative Present here to a greater extent than do many other languages.
In Ancient Greek, there are several verbs that are used in the Perfect corresponding to an English stative Present, including tethnikenai ' be dead ' (Perfect of thniiskein ' die '), memnisthai 'remember ' (Perfect of the passive of mimniiskein ' remind '), hestdnai ' stand ' (Perfect of histdnai ' place (upright) ').l in Swahili,2 the Perfect, marked by the prefix me- after the subject prefix, can translate an English Perfect, as in a-me-fika ' he has arrived ', but will often be translated most naturally into English as a stative Present, e.g. a-me-choka ' he is tired ' (literally ' he has got tired '), a-me-simama ' he is standing ' (literally ' he has stood up ') . In Fante, ' he is tired ' is !Jdfamd, cp. !JrJfamd ' he is getting tired ' and !Jdbd ' he has come ', i.e. is analysable as 3-d-famd, literally ' he has got tired ' . In Kpelle, ' it is all gone ' is translated by ad kpu, cp. e kpEe ' it got used up ' and ad 'kpu ' he has finished it ' . In Kpelle, even ' see ' is expressed as a Perfect, i.e. ad 'kda can correspond to either ' he sees it ' or ' he has caught sight of it '.3
1 Ancient Greek also has some such verbs which lack non-Perfect forms, such as oida Cl know', and correspond to English Presents ; these are less tell ing, since thei r lack of non-Perfect formR is idiosyncratic within Greek itself. For these and other examples, see Goodwin ( 1 889 : 1 5).
2 Ashton ( 1 947 :37). a The Fante and Kpelle examples are from Welmers ( 1 973 : 347-8).
57

Perfect
In languages with no distinct Perfect, then the Past Tense will be used in such constructions. The normal Russian translation of ' I am tired ' is ja ustaf. 1 This is a form of the verb ustavat' (stern uslaj-) (Ipfv.), ustat' (stern ustan-) (Pfv.) ' get tired ' . In the Imperfective it appears, for instance, in ja ustaju ' I am getting tired, I (habitually) get tired ', ja ustaval ' I was getting tired, I used to get tired '. In ja ustal and ja ustanu we have, respectively, the Perfective Past and the Perfective Future of this same verb. Russian does not have a distinct Perfect in the active voice, and ja uslal encompasses English ' I have got tired ' , i.e. ' I am tired ', though it can also mean simply ' I got tired ', and indeed ' I had got tired ', including ' I was tired ', given that the Russian Past Tense covers the range of English Past, Present Perfect, and Pluperfect ; similarlyja ustanu is ' I will get tired ' , incorporating also ' I will have got tired ', i.e. ' I will be tired ' .
In Mandarin Chinese, the verbal particle -le indicates perfective aspect and relative past time reference (section 4.4). With stative predicates, the force of this particle -le is often to indicate a state result­ ing from some previous situation, as in dongxi gui-le ' things are expen­ sive ' (but with the implication that once they were not, i.e. they have become expensive), la shint{ hIlo-le ' his health is (has become) good ' ; these contrast with d6ngxi hen gui ' things are very expensive ', ta shentf hen hOo ' his health is very good ', where there is no implication that things were ever otherwise. One may also compare the following negative
sentences : ta bu den/( ' he isn ' t waiting ' , ta bu deng- le ' h e won ' t wai t ' ,
i .e. h e has entered a state o f being not waiting.
3 . 1 .2. Experiential perfect The experiential perfect2 indicates that a given situation has
held at least once during some time in the past leading up to the present.
1 Since Russian has no overt-copula in the Present Tense, one might think, from the English gloss, that ustal is an adjective 'ti red' , and there is indeed an adjective Ilstalyj 'tired' of which this could, morphologically, be the predicative form. However, further examination shows that the ustal ofja ustal is not a form of the adjective ustalyj ; for instance, 'I was tired' still comes out as ja ustal, although with an adjectival predicate the Past Tense of the copula is byl. In Russian one cannot say ·ja byl ustal. Moreover, the plural is my ustali, with the verbal ending -i ; the adjec­ tival ending -y would give ·my ustaly. 'I will be tired' is ja ustanu, where ustanu can only be a verb.
• Other terms found in the literature are 'existential' perfect, 'indefinite' perfect.

3. I Types of perfect

A useful illustrative example in English is the distinction between be. and go in sentences like Bill has been to America and Bill has gone to America, since English here makes an overt distinction between the experiential perfect and the perfect of result. Bill has gone to America is perfect of result, and implies that Bill is now in America, or is on his way there, this being the present result of his past action of going to (setting out for) America. In Bill has been to America, however, there is no such implication ; this sentence says that on at least one occasion (though possibly on more than one) Bill did in fact go to America. In general, however, English does not have a distinct form with experiential perfect meaning. A number of other languages, including most of the more familiar European languages, are like English in not making any systematic distinction between these two senses. However, some languages can and do make the distinction regularly. In Mandarin Chinese,l the marker of the Experiential Perfect is the toneless suffix
_guo. 2 Thus in Chinese we have a contrast between n{ chi-le yrichi
mei-you ' have you eaten the shark's fin? ' and nr chi-guo yucht mei-you ' have you ever eaten shark's fin? ' . A similar distinction exists in Kpelle.3 The Perfect of result for ' I have fixed it ' would be vaa 'kpctc (se. and it works), while the Experiential Perfect would be Vd 'kpctc (i.e. I have indeed on one or more occasions fixed it, but it keeps breaking down) . The difference between English he has gone to Monrovia and he has been to Monrovia comes out in the same way, as respectively : aa U DukJ:J and d U DuM:J.
In the examples of the experiential perfect given so far, it has been the case that the time during which the situation referred to must have held at least once has included the whole of time up to the present ; thus Bill has been to America places no restriction on when Bill went to America, other than that it was sometime before the present. It is possible to restrict the period of time by specifying an earlier limit, in addition to the necessary later limit of the present moment, as in Bill has been to America since the war, which says that Bill has been to America at least once in the period between the war (earlier limit) and the present moment (later limit).'

1 Chao ( 1 968 : 2 5 1 -2).

2 There is also a suffix -guo, usually with fourth tone, indicating completion

of an action ; apart from the potential tone difference, -guo of completed

action, but not experiential -guo, may be followed by other aspectual

markers, e.g. -le.

• Welmers ( 1 973 : 3 5 1-2).

4 With the experiential perfect the requirement of present relevance is still

important. Thus Chomsky ( 1 97 1 : 2 1 2-13) and McCawley ( 1 97 1 : 1 06-8)

59

Perfect
3 . 1 .3 . Perfect ofpersistent situation One use of the English Perfect, indeed one that seems to be
characteristic of English, is the use of the Perfect to describe a situation that started in the past but continues (persists) into the present, as in we've lived herefor ten years. I've shopped therefor years, I've been waiting for hours. Many other languages use the present tense here : French j'attends depuis trois jours, German ich warte schon drez' Tage, Russian ja idu u�e tri dnja ' I have been waiting for three days '.1 The use of the Perfect here in English is not entirely surprising, since the situation referred to is both past and present, though it is clear that a language is by no means forced to express such situations in this way, and indeed it seems more typical not to.
3 . 1 .4. Perfect of recent past In many languages, the perfect may be used where the
present relevance of the past situation referred to is simply one of temporal closeness, i.e. the past situation is very recent. In English, for instance, the general constraint against combining the Perfect with a specification of time does not hold when the time specification is the adverb recently or one of its close synonyms : I have recently learned that the match is to be postponed, mu has just (this minute) arrived. The perfect does not, of course, in general necessarily imply that the past situation is recent, since present relevance does not necessarily imply recentness : the sentence the Second World War has ended will be per­ fectly acceptable to someone who has been on a desert island, cut off from all sources of news since 1944.2 However, while present relevance does not imply recentness, recentness may be a sufficient condition for present relevance.
The degree of recentness required varies among languages that
note the anomaly of Einstein has visited PTinceton, with Ei1lStein as subject (according to Chomsky) or topic (according to McCawley) of the sentence, given that Einstein is known to be dead. Both Chomsky and McCawley
claim that Princeton has been visited by Einstein is acceptable, with
Princeton as subject or topic, given the knowledge that Princeton still exists. The present author's judgement does not agree with theirs on the second sentence, and it seems that the precise conditions are subject to some degree of idiolectal variation. 1 Such sentences in German and Russian often contain the adverb schon (German), !de (Russian) 'already'. I Compare McCawley's discussion ( 1 97 1 : 348-50) of what he terms the 'hot news perfect'.
60

3 .2 Perfect and other aspects
allow the perfect to express recent past time reference. For most speakers of English, only the adverb recently and its near synonyms are allowed, while any other specification of past time or period is excluded, i.e. one cannot say I41 've been to the dentist this morning during the afternoon or evening.l In Spanish , the use of the Perfect for recent situations is rather wider, so that la he visto (Perfect) esta mafiana would be possible for ' I saw her this morning ', said in the afternoon. Gradual relaxation of the degree of recentness required for use of the Perfect seems to have been a key part of the development of the Perfect in many Romance languages to oust the Simple Past completely. In French grammar of the seventeenth century, a rule of thumb, the ' rule of twenty-four hours ', was stated,2 whereby the Perfect could be used for a situation that held not more than twenty-four hours before the present ; while the criterion was hardly as rigid as this in practice, the rule does bear some relation to usage of the time. In modern spoken French, Italian, and Romanian, except in certain regional dialects of these languages, the Perfect has completely supplanted the Simple Past ; since the Perfect in these languages does not have perfect meaning, the term ' Compound Past ' is perhaps preferable to ' Perfect ', as in some traditional grammars of these languages. Given that the perfect partakes of both present and past, it is possible for languages to differ over just how present or past their perfect forms are. The development that has taken place in these Romance languages can be seen as a gradual reduc­ tion of the presentness of the relevant forms, which finally become purely past.
3 .2. Perfect and other aspects 3 .2.0. In the majority of those languages where it is formally possible for the perfectfnonperfect distinction to combine freely with other aspectual distinctions, we find that such combinations do in fact occur. There are exceptions, such as Modern Greek, where the Perfect, in any case more restricted in use than in English, for instance, can only
1 The important factor here is whether or not the period referred to as this morning is over or not. One can say I've been to the dentist's today in the afternoon, even if the visit in fact took place in the morning, since today
includes the present moment (as well as the morning), and is thus not a
specification of past time. But see also footnote I , page 54.
I Lancelot and Arnauld ( 1 660 : 1 03-4), who cite the examplesj'ecrivis (Past Definite) hier 'I wrote yesterda y ' , but j'ai eerit (Perfect) ee matin, eette nuit ' I wrote this morning, last night'.
61

Perfect

be formed from Perfective verbs ;1 in Georgian, the Imperfective Perfect

is rare, at least for nonstative verbs.2 In Ancient Greek, the morphology

of the Perfect precludes combination with the Aorist/lmperfect aspectual

distinction, since different stems are used for the three verb forms, e.g.

el,/on (Imperfect) ' I was loosing, used to loose ' , elfisa (Aorist) ' I loosed ' ,

!eluka (Perfcct) ' I have loosed '. B u t the main point o f interest here will be the combinability and resultant meaning of aspectual distinctions

that can be combined, such as perfect and progressive in English (1 hm'e

been singing) and Portuguese (tenho estado trabalhando ' I have been

worki ng '), or Perfect and Imperfective in Bulgarian. At first sight, it may seem contradictory that a verb form can be both perfect and

imperfective, or both perfect and progressive (given that progressive is

even more restricted than imperfective), but this apparent contradiction

is once again due to the tendency to confuse perfect and perfective. The

perfect links a present state to a past situation, whether this past

situation was an individual event, or a state, or a process not yet com­

pleted, so that there is nothing in the definition of the perfect to preclude

combination with the imperfective or progressive.3

The possible range of meaning of such combinations of aspectual

categorics can be illustrated by looking at the English Perfect Progres­

sive. If we take first of all the characteristically English use of the

Perfect to refer to a persistent situation, i.e. onc that continues up to the

present time (and may continue beyond), then we find that the distribu­

tion of the Progressive and non-Progressive forms is essentially the same

as in the Present Tense : the non-Progressive form must be used with

stative verbs ('If1 have been knowing him for a long time), while other

verbs, u nless habitual, will normally be in the Progressive (1 have been

speaking for ages) . With the experitntial perfect, it is quite possible for

the situation in which we are interested to be an ongoing process, as in

ha�'e you ever been watching television when the tube has exploded?

Similarly with the perfect of recent past, as in the police have recently been keeping my neighbour under observation, or 1 have just this minute

been talking to my solicitor. More generally, the Perfect Progressive

combines the possible meanings of the Perfect with the possible mean­

ings of the Progrcssive.'

1 Thus corresponding to exo feri (Pfv.) 'I have carried' there is no *exo

ferni (lpfv.).

2 Vogt ( 1 97 1 : 1 93).

3 In Bulgarian, the Imperfective Perfect is also possible given the un­

markedness of the Imperfective vis-�-vis the Perfective ; see chapter 6.

• Compare the discussion in Leech ( 1 97 1 : 44--'7 ).

62

3 .2 Perfect and other aspects
In the discussion of Russian ja ustal ' I am tired ' or ' I got tired ' towards the end of section 3 . I . I , we noted that Russian often uses the Perfective to correspond to explicitly perfect forms in languages that have such forms, although Russian has in fact no distinct perfect forms.l However, the Russian Imperfective is by no means incompatible with perfect meaning. Some instances of the Imperfective allowing perfect meaning follow from the unmarkedness of the Russian Imper­ fective (chapter 6), but not all. For instance, if I visit a friend and see his house half-whitewashed, and him sitting in his garden resting, then I may say, in English, I see you've been whitewashing the house : the present half-whitewashed state of the house is the result of my friend's having been occupied in the task of whitewashing it, whence the Perfect Progressive. If I were to say in Russian, using the Perfective, vy pobelili dom, then this could only imply that the whitewashing was already complete, i.e. ' you've whitewashed the house ', and in the situation described above this would simply be untrue. In fact, in such a case in Russian one could use the (Imperfective) Present, to describe a p rocess which, at the present moment, is not yet complete, i.e. vy belite dom ; without a more elaborate paraphrase there is no way of con­ veying the idea contained in the English Progressive Perfect of a situation that has been interrupted but whose completed portion has present results. Similarly, there are cases where English will use the Perfect but Russian will use the Imperfective where the English Perfect refers to a habitual situation, as in oni prodol.zajut pol'zovat'sja starymi metodami, kotorye uie ne raz opravdyvali (Ipfv.) sebja ' they continue to use the old methods, which have already on many occasions justified themselves ' . Corresponding t o the English Perfect, then, one finds both Perfective and Imperfective in Russian, just as one finds both aspects correspond­ ing to English non-Perfect forms. The perfect/nonperfect opposition is different frqm the perfective/imperfective opposition.
There does still, however, remain the generalisation that there are some languages, like Modern Greek, where the perfect is restricted to perfective aspect, while there are apparently none where the perfect is restricted to imperfective aspect, i.e. there is a more natural relationship between perfect and perfective than between perfect and imperfective. If we look again at the meaning of the perfect and of the perfective/
1 This applies strictly only to the active voice ; for the passive. see section 4.6. For a recent discussion of Russian Perfectives with perfect meaning, see Lonngren ( 1 973).

Perfect
imperfective opposition, the reason for this frequent, but by no means obligatory, relation becomes clear : the perfect looks at a situation in terms of its consequences, and while it is possible for an incomplete situation to have consequences, it is much more likely that consequences will be consequences of a situation that has been brought to completion, i.e. of a situation that is likely to be described by means of the perfective.
3.3. Prospective aspect The perfect is retrospective, in that it establishes a relation
between a state at one time and a situation at an earlier time. If languages were completely symmetrical, one might equally well expect to find prospective forms, where a state is related to some subsequent situation, for instance where someone is in a state of being about to do something. Many languages do have means of giving overt expression to prospective meaning, though in some languages it is difficult to find exact equivalents without going into long periphrases. As noted in the Introduction, languages are not in fact symmetrical about the axis of present time, so that it should not be surprising that there is no direct correspondence between forms with perfect meaning and forms with prospective meaning.
Typical English expressions of prospective meaning are the construc­ tions to be going to, to be about to, to be on the point of, as in the ship is about to sail, the ship is on the point of sailing - both of which describe the ship's present state relative to some future event, with these con­ structions an imminently future event - and the ship is going to sail, where there is again a present state related to a future event, but here without any implication of imminent futurity.l It is important to appreciate the difference betwecn these expressions of prospective meaning and expressions of straight future time reference, e.g. between Bill is going to throw himself off the cliff and Bill will throw himself off the clif.f If we imagine a situation where someone says one of these two sentences, and then Bill is in fact prevented from throwing himself off the cliff, then if the speaker said Billwill throw himselfoff the clif,f he was wrong, his prediction was not borne out. If, however, he said Bill is going to throw himself off the clif,f then he was not necessarily wrong,
1 Compare the examples quoted by Leech ( 1 97 1 : 56) : I'm going to be a policeman when I grow up ; if Winterbottom's calculations are correct, this
planet is going to burn itself out 200,000,000 years from now. Note that here,
unlike in the Perfect, it is possible to specify the time at which the future situation will occur.

3.3 Prospective aspect
since all he was alluding to was Bill's intention to throw himself off the cliff, i.e. to the already present seeds of some future situation, which future situation might well be prevented from coming about by inter­ vening factors. Indeed, Bill is going to throw himself off the cliff might well be shouted as a warning to some third party to prevent the future situation from coming about.
In Russian, for instance, it is very difficult to give an adequate trans­ lation of an English prospective of this type, without adding or sub­ tracting some element of meaning. Thus one translation of I am going to kill you would be ja sobirajus' ubit' tebja, literally ' I intend to kill you ', but this does add an element of intention which is not necessarily present in the English prospective forms. This construction could not be used as the Russian translation of there are going to be apples for pudding, where the apples are presumably not intending to be eaten for pudding, and in Russian one can only use the ordinary Future Tense : budut jabloki na tret'e ' there will be apples for pudding ' . Sometimes Russian uses dol5en ' must ' in such constructions, e.g. poezd dolzen prij'ti v sem' lasov ' the train is going to arrive at seven o'clock ', but again the Russian is not an exact equivalent of the English, and a better gloss might be ' the train is due to arrive at seven o'clock '.

Aspect and tense
4.0. So far, we have been emphasising the difference between tense and aspect, particularly in so far as traditional grammatical terminology does not always rigorously distinguish the two parameters, which can lead to confusion in discussing either aspect or tense in its own right. However, at various points it has been noted that aspect and tense do sometimes impinge on one another, and it is now time to examine more systematically some of the relationships between aspect and tense in various languages.
4. I . Perfective, present, and future Since the present tense is essentially used to describe, rather
than to narrate, it is essentially imperfective, either continuous or habitual, and not perfective. In this section we shall look at perfective presents in various languages, investigating the meanings associated with this apparently contradictory combination of categories.
In languages where the basic tense distinction is between past and non-past, we have strictly speaking not the possibility of a perfective present, but rather of a perfective non-past, i.e. of the perfective of the present-future. Since the present is primarily a tense of description, it is quite natural for the perfective non-p ast to h ave as one of its meaning that of a perfective future. Various stages of this development of perfective non-past to perfective future can be seen in different Indo­ European (especially Slavonic) and non-Indo-European languages. In Hungarian, where the aspectual significance of the verbal prefixes is rather weakly developed, although they tend to give the verb perfective meaning, there is a tendency for the nonpast of such prefixed verbs to have future meaning.1 In the East and West Slavonic languages (includ­ ing Russian, Polish, Czech, but not Bulgarian or Serbo-Croatian), and
1 Majtinskaja (1 959 : 1 8 1).
66

4. I Perfective, present, andfuture

also in Georgian, the development is more complete, so that the

Perfective non-Past is primarily a future tense, a point to which we shall

return in greater detail below ; it is paralleled by a new periphrastic

formation for the Imperfective Future.1 With nonderived verbs of

motion in Czech, a further development has taken place whereby the

earlier Perfective non-Past has become a Future Tense irrespective of

aspect, i.e. a development from Perfective non-Past to Perfective

Future to Future. In the Past Tense, sel ' went ' is Imperfective, and

posel Perfective. But in the non-Past, the difference between jdu and

pujdu (for po +jdu) is not aspectual (as is the case with Russian idu,

Imperfective Present, versus pojdu, Perfective Future), but purely

temporal, i.e. jdu ' I go, am going ', pujdu ' I shall go, shall have gone,

shall be going ' . With these verbs of motion Czech has no specifically

Imperfective Future ""budu jit to parallel Russian budu idti ' I shall be

going, shall go (Ipfv.) " although this is how Imperfective Futures of

other shall

rveeardbs(Iaprfevf.)o,r.mOendei

n Czech too, explanation

e.g. budu list ' I shall be of the etymology of the

reading, Ancient

Greek aspectually neutral Future Tense, e.g. grdpso ' I shall write, shall

be writing ', would derive this too from the Aorist (i.e. perfective) stem

of the verb, cp. the Aorist egrapsa ' I wrote '.2

In the light of this expected restriction of the perfective nonpast to

future tense, it is worth looking in some detail at those languages where

the perfective present is not primarily a future tense (e.g. South Slavonic)

and also at individual usages in some of the languages that normally

have the expected development, but sometimes have a perfective non­

past that seems to parallel the imperfective present rather than the

imperfective future (where this is a distinct form from the imperfective

present). The uses of the Perfective Present in South Slavonic involve

cases where the Present Tense is used in ways that are not strictly

referring to the present moment.

One characteristic of the South Slavonic languages, found in its

fullest form in Bulgarian, though also to a certain extent in Serbo­

Croatian, for instance, is the loss of the Infinitive and its replacement by

a subordinate clause with the conjunction da and the Present Tense

1 In the South Slavonic languages, including Bulgarian and Serbo­ Croatian, there is a periphrastic Future for both aspects, so that the Perfective Present is not a Future Tense, as it is in East and West Slavonic ; the Perfective Present in South Slavonic is discussed further below.
I Kurylowicz ( 1 964 : l I S).

Aspect and tense
(though without any necessary reference to present time, any more than there is with the Infinitive in languages like English or Russian that have an Infinitive). The Infinitive can distinguish aspect in Russian, where we have the Imperfective inja mogu letat' ' I can fly ', but the Perfective in ja xocu kupit' knigu ' I want to buy a book ' . If we translate these sentences into Bulgarian, we must replace the Infinitive by the Present Tense, but since there is not actual reference to present time, the aspectual opposition may and must be retained : moga da letja (Ipfv.), literally ' I-can that I-fly (Ipfv.) ', versus iskam da kupja (Pfv.) kniga, literally ' I-want that I-buy book '. If the main verbs are put into the Past Tense, there is no change in the form of the subordinate verb : mozax da letja ' I could fly ', iskax da kupja kniga ' I wanted to buy a book '.
In English, a sentence like he comes here on its own, in present mean­ ing, will normally be interpreted with habitual meaning, since if the reference were to an action going on at the present moment it would have to be he is coming here, i.e. Progressive. However, in a context where he comes here does not have present time reference, then perfective meaning is a possible interpretation, as in a subordinate clause of time, e.g. when he comes here, I'll tell him, since here the verb comes refers to a future action. Different languages differ as to whether or not they require overt specification of futurity in such temporal clauses ; contrast with the English sentence above its French translation : quand il viendra (Future) ici, je le lui dirai, and also with its Russian translation : kogda on pridet (Future), ja emu skazu. Bulgarian and Serbo-Croatian in such sentences are like English rather than French or Russian, and have the Present in the temporal clause, as in Bulgarian sled kato svNla (Pfv. Present) tazi rabota, lte otida (Pfv. Future) na selo ' when I finish this work, I shall go to the country '.
At this point, an apparent weakness of the comparison between languages like English and Bulgarian on the one hand and French and Russian on the other, especially between Bulgarian and Russian, may strike the reader. Morphologically, Russian pridet in the example quoted above is a Perfective non-Past, cp. the Imperfective Present idet ' he­ goes ' . The same is true, morphologically, of Bulgarian svarla, although given the existence of a separate Perfective Future in Bulgarian (with fte) svarla is specifically Perfective Present rather than the less specific Perfective non-Past. Given the parallelism of morphological formation between the forms used in Bulgarian and Russian, and the fact that both
68

4. I Perfective, present, and future
are used equally in temporal clauses with future reference, it may seem casuistic to speak in the one case (Bulgarian) of a Perfective Present and in the other (Russian) of a Perfective Future, since the data provide no evidence for such a distinction. However, the different functions of the morphologically parallel Bulgarian and Russian forms can be identified by comparing sentences where the verb in the subordinate clause is Imperfective, rather than Perfective, because here Bulgarian and Russian have quite different morphological expressions of the Imperfec­ tive Future : in Bulgarian the particle ste with the Imperfective Present, in Russian budu with the Imperfective Infinitive. And in such sentences we find a clear distinction between Bulgarian, with the Imperfective Present as in English, and Russian, with the Imperfective Future as in French : Bulgarian az kato peja (Ipfv. Present), ti ste places, Russian kogda ja budu pet' (Ipfv. Future), ty budel' plakat', French quand je chanterai (Future) tu pleureras, English when I am singing (Present) you will be crying. Thus the comparison with corresponding Imperfec­ tives confirms the distinction between Bulgarian with the Present Tense in what is strictly not present time reference (as in English), and Russian with the Future Tense (as in French), despite the apparent morphological parallelism between Perfective Present in Bulgarian and Perfective Future in Russian.
Another function of the Perfective Present in Bulgarian is in the narrative Present, i.e. when the Present Tense is used with past meaning as a narrative technique with retention of the aspectual distinctions usual in the Past Tense. This use of the Perfective Present is discussed in greater detail in section 4.3 .
Finally, in Bulgarian the Perfective Present may be used with habitual meaning, or rather is one of the possible means of expressing habituality, where the habituality involved is that of a situation which would in itself, as a single instance, be treated as perfective ; i.e. the Present Tense is used to express a habitual situation by presenting one instance to exemplify the recurrent situation, as in :1 spoglednat (Pfv. Present) se, pousmixllat (Pfv. Present) devojki, ponadevat (Pfv. Present) zarumeni lica . . . ' the girls look at one another, smile at one another, incline their reddened faces . . . '. The sense is not, however, that this is what they are doing at the present moment, but rather that this is what happens whenever a certain set of circumstances holds (and, indeed, it is quite likely that this particular set of circumstances does not hold precisely
1 This example is c ited by Andrejczin ( 1 93 8 : 3 2).

Aspect and tense
at the present moment). This function of the Perfective Present is paralleled by the use of the Perfective Imperfect in Bulgarian to indicate a habitual perfective situation in past time (see section 1.2. 1.1).
With this habitual use of the Perfective Present, it may seem once again that Russian has the same phenomenon as Bulgarian, since Russian too has a similar use of the Perfective non-Past with habitual meaning, and indeed in this usage the Perfective non-Past usually occurs in conjunction with the Imperfective Present, i.e. abstracting away from the aspectual differences it would appear that we are here dealing with a Perfective Present in Russian. This usage is very common with past time reference, the actual past time being marked by temporal adverbials, the verb form byvalo ' it used to be (the case that . . .) " or simply by context, as in the following example from Turgenev :1
Byvalo, sidit (Ipfv.) . . . i smotrit (Ipfv.) na Irinu . . . a ona kak budto
serditsja (Ipfv.), kak budto skucaet (Ipfv.), vstanet (Pfv.), projdetsja (Pfv.) po komnate, xolodno posmotrit (Pfv.) na nego, pozmet (Pfv.) plecom. It used to happen that he would sit (Ipfv.) . . .and gaze (Ipfv.) at lrina . . . and would seem to be angry (Ipfv.), to be bored (Ipfv.), she would get up (Pfv.), walk about (Pfv.) the room, look (Pfv.) coldly at him, shrug (Pfv.) her shoul ders .
Here, the Imperfective forms describe the background states of each occurrence of this series of events, while the actual events are expressed by Perfective forms, the tenses being the Imperfective Present and the Perfective non-Past. However, as will be discussed in greater detail in section 4.3, there is in current usage a tendency for this aspectual dis­ tinction to be expressed rather by the difference between the Imperfec­ tive Future (i.e. budu with the Infinitive) and the Perfective non-Past ( Future) ; it is only the fact that the Perfective non-Past is a Perfective Future that explains the current movement towards using the Imperfec­ tive Future rather than the Imperfective Present in such constructions.
Despite the formal parallelism between the Perfective Present in Bulgarian (and similar languages, such as Serbo-Croatian) and the Perfective non-Past in Russian (and similar languages, such as Czech and Polish), it emerges that the latter is primarily a future tense, and not a present tense, while apparent instances of its use as a present tense are to be treated as remnants, as anomalies within the synchronic system. Given the historical development from a Perfective non-Past, the existence of such relicts of earlier usage is not surprising. In Georgian,
1 Cited by Borras and Christian ( 1 97 1 : 1 22).

4.2 Tense restrictions
as in Russian, the Perfective non-Past is now primarily a future tense, although there are perhaps rather more remnants of earlier usage where the Perfective non-Past parallels exactly the Imperfective Present, as in the maintenance of aspectual distinctions in the narrative Present (section 4.3), although the absence in Georgian of any specifically Imperfective Future should also be noted as a conditioning factor : Georgian has in fact an Imperfective non-Past and a Perfective non­ Past, the former being rather freely present or future, the latter future except in certain special usages (in particular the narrative and habitual Present) with overt indication of its unusual time reference.
Summarising the relation between aspect and tense in Russian, we can say that there is a Present Tense which is Imperfective, a Past Tense with an Imperfective/Perfective opposition, and a Future Tense with an Imperfective/Perfective opposition. Morphologically, the Imperfective Future rather falls outside the system, being periphrastic, while the morphological parallelism is rather between the Imperfective Present and the Perfective Future. The morphology, together with some individual usages of the Perfective Future, suggest an earlier stage where there was just one non-Past Tense with an Imperfective/Perfective aspectual distinction, but this is no longer true of the modern language, where restrictions on the compatibility of Present and Perfective have led to the Perfective non-Past becoming specifically a Perfective Future.l
4.2. Aspectual distinctions restricted to certain tenses One of the most interesting relationships between aspect and
tense, from the viewpoint of language as a functional system, occurs when an aspectual distinction is restricted to one or more tenses, rather than operating across the board, independently of tense. It appears that the tense that most often evinces aspectual distinctions is the past tense. Thus in many Indo-European languages, and also in Georgian, the difference between the Aorist and the Imperfect exists only in the Past Tense, and there is no corresponding distinction in other tenses : thus the distinction between Spanish hable ' I spoke ' and hablaba ' I was speaking, used to speak ', Latin veni ' I came ' and veniebam ' I was coming, used to come ', Bulgarian broix ' I counted ' and brojax ' I was counting, used to count ', Georgian (da)fere ' you wrote ' and ferdi ' you

71

Aspect and tense
were writing, used to write ' is not paralleled by any comparable dis­ tinction in the Present or Future, or in the nonfinite forms of the verb (e.g. infinitives and participles, except in certain cases where these are explicitly Past Tense). In these cases the aspectual distinction is essentially between perfective meaning on the one hand and imperfective meaning on the other. Given that this is the basic distinction, it is not surprising from a functional viewpoint that there should be no similar distinction in the present, since the present, as an essentially descriptive tense, can normally only be of imperfective meaning. In contrasting past and present tense, it therefore becomes clearer why there should be a greater need for this particular aspectual distinction in the past than in the present. One still needs an explanation for why so many languages would make an explicit aspectual distinction in the past. Correlations between aspect and time reference in a number of African languages, among others,l suggest that the most typical usages of verbs in the present tense are those denoting actions in progress or states (i.e. with continuous, or continuous and habitual meaning), whereas in the past the most typical usages of verbs, especially nonstative verbs, are those with perfective meaning. If we take it that it is most natural for a past tense verb to have perfective meaning, then it is natural for a language to seek some other means of expressing a past tense that does not indicate a single complete action, and it is here that the Imperfect/Aorist dis­ tinction enters. In fact, the Imperfect expresses in past tense an aspectual value that is more typical of the present. In traditional Indo-European linguistics, the Imperfect is often characterised as the ' Present in the Past ', which captures the above observation that the Imperfect expresses a typically present tense aspectual value in the past tense.
However, in some languages we find other aspectual distinctions made in the past tense but not in other tenses, suggesting that it may well be a general characteristic of human languages to resort to greater aspectual differentiation in the past than in other tenses. Thus the English periphrastic Habitual with used to has no corresponding form in other tenses. Similarly, the Slavonic Habitual in -v- occurs most typically in the Past Tense, and in some languages, such as Russian, is virtually restricted to Past Tense, apart from a few isolated verbs like byvat' ' be (habitually) '. Presumably the greater potential aspectual range of the past tense is an impetus towards greater aspectual differen­ tiation in this tense. With these Habituals, unlike the most typical
1 For the details, see section 4.5 .

4.3 Narrative present
Indo-European Imperfects and Aorists, there is no morphological reason why the aspectual distinction should be restricted to only the one tense.
Thus an explicit perfective, distinct from the imperfective, is most common in the past tense, and least common in the present tense. Of course, if the tense distinction is past versus nonpast, rather than past versus future, then it is possible for there to be a perfective non-past, with basically future meaning, as in Russian. Apart from the past, where the perfective is commonest, and the present, where it is rarest, there does not seem to be any general principle as to where aspectual distinc­ tions will next manifest themselves, since the remaining categories (future tense, and nonfinite forms like infinitives and participles) seem equally susceptible to aspectual differentiation, although in Ancient Greek we find the aspectual distinction between Aorist and Imperfect carried over to the various nonfinite forms, but not to the Future. Since the future is generally rather poorly differentiated as a tense distinct from the present in many European languages, this may be the reason for the absence of as well-marked an aspectual distinction in this tense ; compare the absence in Italian, but not in Spanish, of a Future Progressive (Italian ·staro scrivendo, Spanish estare escribiendo ' I shall be writing '), although there is no morphological reason for the absence of ·staro scrivendo in Italian.
4.3 . Narrative present One interesting facet of the general problem of the relation
between tense and aspect can be studied by examining cases where languages use one tense in place of another, for instance in the narrative present, where the present tense is used to refer to a past situation. A simple English example would be the use of I'm sitting on the verandah when up comes Joe and says . . . rather than I was sitting on the verandah when up came Joe and said . . . , though this use of the Present is perhaps rather less common in English than in other European languages. Since the English Progressive is not tied to any one tense, there is no problem with aspect in the narrative Present, the difference between Progressive and non-Progressive being retained, or rather retainable, in the displaced version. This is not true of French, for instance, where the difference between perfective and imperfective meaning is only maintained overtly in the Past Tense, by the difference between Past Definite and Imperfect. Thus the aspect distinction in the Past Tense version is lost when we use the narrative Present :
73

Aspect and tense
(i) in Past Tense Un homme s'amenait (Imperfect) sur la route, il conduisait (Imperfect) trois moutons. Il aperfUt (Past Definite) l'ane charge et dit (Past Definite) . . . (ii) in Present Tense Un homme s'amene sur la route, il conduit trois moutons. Il aperfoit I'ane charge et dil . . .
A man was/is walking along the road, he was/is leading three sheep. He
saw/sees the laden donkey and said/says . . .
In French, then, and likewise in other Romance languages, the morphological restriction of overt aspect differentiation to the Past Tense means that a priori there can be no aspect distinction in the narrative Present. In languages that do have a morphological aspect distinction in the non-past tenses too, there are two logical possibilities : either the aspect difference of the past will be retained, even if this means using morphological forms (like the Perfective non-Past in Georgian) that are normally restricted to future time reference ; or the illusion of presentness (description rather than narration) will be com­ pleted by neutralising the aspect distinction.1
In Georgian, although the Perfective non-Past usually has future meaning, in the narrative Present it is used to parallel the Imperfective Present, retaining the aspect distinction ; thus the Perfective non-Past corresponds to the Perfective (typically Aorist) Past, the Imperfective Present to the Imperfective (typically Imperfect) Past :2
(i) in Past Tense Gzaze erti �aci midioda (Ipfv. Imperfect), sami cxvari mihqavda (Ipfv. Im­ perfect), dainaxa (Pfv. Aorist) dal$.idebuli 30ri da tkva (Pfv. Aorist) . . . (ii) in Present Tense Gzaze erti �aci midis (Ipfv. Present), sami cxvari mihqavs (Ipfv. Present), dainaxavs (Pfv. Present) dal$.idebul 30rs da i/qvis (Pfv. Present) . . . A man was/is going along the road, he was/is leading three sheep, he saw/sees the laden donkey and said/says . . .
In Georgian, then, although the Perfective of the Present usually has future meaning, this does not prevent the use of this form in the narra­ tive Present.
In Bulgarian, although there is a Perfective Present that does not
1 Quite generally, in languages that have a narrative Present, we find different choices as to how present and how past this form behaves. Thus in Latin, in the sequence of tenses, the narrative Present (historic Present) may be treated either as a primary (i.e. non-Past) or as a historic (i.e. Past) tense (Gildersleeve and Lodge 1 895 : 3 14- 1 7).

4.3 Narrative present
have specifically future meaning, yet still the more usual construction in the narrative Present is to lose the aspect difference, using the Imperfective to correspond to Past Tense forms irrespective of aspect (Perfective versus Imperfective, Aorist versus Imperfect), and com­ pleting the illusion of presentness :1
(i) in Past Tense
Carja spjale (Ipfv. Imperfect) . . . Cukna (Pfv. Aorist) djado Ivan-nikoj ne
mu se obadi (Pfv. Aorist). Tragna (Pfv. Aorist) po belija kaldar;)m . . . (ii) in Present Tense Carja spi (Ipfv. Present) . . . Cuka (Ipfv. Present) djado Ivan-nikoj ne mu se obadida (Ipfv. Present). Tragva (Ipfv. Present) po belij a kaldar;)m • . .
The King was/is sleeping . . . Old Ivan knocked/knocks-no-one answered/an­
swers. He set/sets off along the white pavement . . .
However, it is also possible to maintain the aspect distinction between Perfective and Imperfective in the narrative Present, corresponding to Perfective Past (usually Aorist) and Imperfective Past (usually Imper­ fect), respectively.s
At the other extreme we find Russian. Here, the Perfective non-Past has been preempted as a future tense, so that in the narrative Present only the Imperfective Present may be used, as in the following example from Aksenov :3
(i) in Past Tense Vdrug nda polutorka ostanovilas' (Pfv.). Vperedi doroga byla (Ipfv.) pusta. Tol'ko daleko-daleko kakoj -to odinokij malen'kij soldatik stojal (Ipfv.) i smotrel (Ipfv.) v nasu storonu. Stadina spal (Ipfv.). My s Saskoj soskolili (Pfv.) na dorogu . • . (ii) in Present Tense Vdrug nasa polutorka ostanavlivaetsja (Ipfv.). Vperedi doroga pusta. Tol'ko daleko-daleko kakoj -to odinokij malen'kij soldatik stoit (Ipfv.) i smotr;t (Ipfv.) v ndu storonu. Starsina spit (Ipfv.). My s Sa5koj soskakivaem (Ipfv.) na dorogu . . . Suddenly our one-and-a-half-tonner stopped/stops. The road ahead was/is empty. Only way in the distance a lonely small soldier stood/stands and looked/looks in our direction. The sergeant-major was/is sleeping. Sashka and I jumped/jump down onto the road . . .
1 This example is cited by Andrejczin ( 1 938 : 32). • M. Ivic informs me that the use of the Serbo-Croatian narrative Present
is similar to that of Bulgarian in this respect : either the aspect distinction is lost in favour of the Imperfective, or it may be retained. • Cited by Forsyth ( 1 970 : 1 S I ) ; the Past Tense version is mine.

Aspect and tense
There is no possibility of using the Perfective non-Past in such a sentence. However, there is another narrative usage of the Present Tense in
Russian, with habitual meaning : a recurrent sequence of events is narrated as if it were a single sequence, i.e. one instance stands for the whole pattern. Here, it is usual to maintain the aspectual distinction : corresponding to an Imperfective Past we have the Imperfective Present, while corresponding to the Perfective Past we have the Perfective non­ Past, this time devoid of future meaning. In the following example from Sholokhov, l we have first the appropriate Past Tense forms for describ­ ing one individual occurrence of the sequence in question, then the narrative use of the Present :
(i) in Past Tense (Levuju ruku otorvalo po lokot', no i odnoj krutil Aleksej cigarki iskusno i bez promaxa :) priial (Pfv.) kiset k vypuklomu zaslonu grudi, zubami otorval (Pfv.) nuznyj klocok bumagi, sognul (Pfv.) ego zelobkom, nagreb (Pfv.) tabaku i neulovimo pavel (Pfv.) paJ'cami, skrucivaja.

One had no time to turn around before Aleksey was already chewing the finished cigarette, blinking, and asking for a light.
In such constructions, Bulgarian behaves like Russian, despite the usual difference between the Bulgarian Perfective Present and the Russian Perfective Future.2
1 Cited by Forsyth ( 1 970 : 1 8 1 ) ; the Past Tense version is again mine. 2 For Russian, there is some evidence that the pure aspectual (rather
than combined tense and aspect) opposition between Imperfective Present and Perfective non-Past is exceptional within the general system. Forsyth ( 1 970 : 1 83) notes that in the habitual narrative Present, one occasionally finds the Imperfective Future, rather than the Imperfective Present. In other words, given that in perfective meaning wc have the Perfective non-Past, which in Russian is a Perfective Future, the natural tendency is to use as the corresponding Imperfective the Imperfective Future.

4.3 Narrative present
Having looked at a number of other languages, we may now return to the interaction of aspect and tense in the English narrative Present. As noted above, in English the non-Progressive Present of nonstative verbs tends to be restricted to expression of habitual actions. Another use of this non-Progressive Present is in the historic Present, where the aspect distinction Progressive/non-Progressive of the Past is retained. A similar use of the non-Progressive Present is what may be called the commentary use of the Present, as in providing a commentary for a film, a football match, or a horse-race (simultaneous narration). Here, although we are in present time, the structure of the communication is that of a narrative. This characteristic structure is reflected in the possibility of using the non-Progressive Present to refer to complete actions, i.e. to maintain an aspect distinction just as one would in the Past Tense, the only difference being that here the maintenance of the distinction is optional, since as in the Present Tense generally the Progressive can be used for all nonhabitual actions. Thus a film com­ mentary might run :
Now the villain seizes the heroine, now they drive off towards the railway track, now he forces her out of the car, now he ties her to the track, while all the time the train is getting nearer.
(All verb forms except the last are non-Progressive.) Equally, the commentary could have been given throughout in the Progressive form :
Now the villain is seizing the heroine, now they're driving off towards the railway track, now he's forcing her out of the car, now he's tying her to the track, while all the time the train is getting nearer.
One factor influencing the choice between the two possibilities is that the non-Progressive is favoured when a rapid series of events has to be commented on as they are happening.1
The usages noted so far in this section have typically shifted the tense (e.g. present for past), and either shifted aspect in accordance with normal usage in the present, or retained aspect in accordance with the distinction between description and narration. Another logical possibility would be to retain the tense, but shift aspect, for instance to lose aspect distinctions in the past tense, just as if the whole had been shifted into the present, with the typical present aspectual distinctions, or lack of distinctions. This may seem a particularly complex set of shifts, but it

Aspect and tense

is apparently quite frequent in contemporary French literary style to make use of the Imparfait pittoresque (picturesque Imperfect), which has just this effect :1
I Ce n'est rien ', dit-if (Past Definite) . . . Puis, au milieu du pansement, il s'interrompait (Imperfect) pour s'ecrier : ' Coup double ! tous les deux roides morts ! . . . C'est le cure qui va rire . . . Coup double ! Ah l voici enfin cette petite tortue de Chalina.' Orso ne repandait (Imperfect) pas. Il etait p�le comme un mort et tremblait de tous ses membres. ' It's nothing ', he said (Past Definite) . . . Then, in the middle of bandaging, he interrupted himself (Imperfect) to shout : • Double hit ! Both of them stiff as corpses ! . . . It's the vicar who's going to laugh . . . Double hit ! Ah ! Here's that little tortoise Chalina at last.' Orso didn't reply (Imperfect). He was pale as a corpse and trembling in every limb.
Here, the Imperfects s'interrompait and repondait are used as if the narrative had been transposed into the Present Tense.

4+ Combined tense/aspect oppositions In written Arabic,2 there are two sets of forms, traditionally
referred to variously as aspects, tenses, or states, and distinguished either as Perfect and Imperfect, or as Perfective and Imperfective. Here the terms Perfective and Imperfective will be used, although the meanings of the terms are different from those used in Slavonic linguis­ tics and elsewhere in this book, as will become apparent below.
Wc may start with the function of the Perfective and Imperfective where the rest of the sentence contains no overt specification of time reference (e.g. no temporal adverbs). Here the Perfective is interpreted with perfective and past meaning, while the Imperfective is interpreted with imperfective and present meaning :

Jalasu (Pfv.) 'iala '1- babi. They-sat-down at the door. ?allahu ya'i lamu (Ipfv.) bi-

God he-know

about

God knows what you are doing.

ma what

ta'imaluna (Ipfv.). you-do.

On the basis of these two examples, we might hypothesise either that the basic distinction is one of tense (with the aspectual difference in this

1 Imhs ( 1 960 : 92-3) : the example is from Merimee. I The examples and commentary in this section are based mainly on
Wright ( 1 898 : 1 -24). For a recent discussion of the history of the Arabic fonns, with comparison with other Semitic languages (especially
Akkadian), see Kurylowicz ( 1 973).

4.4 Combined tense/aspect oppositions

pair being due to chance) or one of aspect (with the time reference difference being a result of preferred interpretations of the aspects). Further investigation reveals that neither of these is true.
The following example introduces a further use of the Imperfective :

Fa 'lIa:hu ya}:lkumu ( l pfv. ) bayna -hum yawma 'l-qiya:mati.

but God he-judge

between them day the resurrection

But God will judge between them on the Day of Resurrection.

Given our knowledge that the Day of Resurrection is to take place, or at least so it is claimed, at some time in the future, the verbal form in this sentence has future time reference. However the sentence is not (or at least, not necessarily) interpreted as having imperfective meaning, indeed it could well correspond to a sentence in a Slavonic language with Per­ fective Aspect. So the difference between the Arabic Perfective and Imperfective cannot be purely one of aspect.
A further complication is introduced by inclusion of subordinate clauses, as in :

?aji?u (Ipfv.) -ka ?idii 'l;lmarra (Pfv.) '1- busru.

I -come

to-you when it-ripen

the unripe-date

I shall come to you when the unripe date ripens (shall ripen).

The Imperfective 2aji2u in isolation would be taken as referring to present time, but the presence of the subordinate temporal clause functions as a temporal adverbial forcing at least a preference for an interpretation with future reference, i.e. ' I shall come ' . But the interpre­ tation of the Perfective 'IJ.marra (citation form nlJ.marra) is not, as predicted on the hypothesis that the Perfective/Imperfective opposition is purely one of tense, with past time reference, but rather with future time reference (i.e. the date has not yet ripened). However, what is important is not the absolute time reference of this verb, but its relative time reference, since what it indicates is that the ripening of the date will precede my coming to you. So one might still conclude that the difference between the Perfective and the Imperfective is one of relative tense. This might seem to be further corroborated by the use of the Imperfective in purpose clauses, since clearly the fulfilment of the purpose must follow (be relative future with respect to) the action designed to carry out that purpose :

?arsala (Pfv.) yu'i limu (Ipfv.) -hu bi- tsiilika.

he-s�nt

he-inform

him about this

He sent (someone) in order to inform him about this.

79

Aspect and tense

The Subjunctive, Jussive, and Imperative moods, all of which have relative future time reference, exist only in the Imperfective, e.g.
I;zatla tal:z9ura (Subjunctive) 2uxti ' until my sister should come ' , yaktub
(Jussive) ' may he write ', 2uktub (Imperative) ' write l ' Apparently, the Perfective indicates relative past time, the Imperfective relative nonpast (present or future) time.
It was noted above that the Imperfective, taken in isolation, is inter­
preted as referring to the present, although it can be interpreted as referring to the future if the context makes it clear that the reference is
to the future. The question that now arises is whether the interpretation can be of reference to past time where there is an overt indicator of past time, e.g. la/a mulki sulaymana ' in Solomon's reign '. The answer is in the affirmative, as in :

Wa 'ttaba'iu (Pfv.)

ma tatlo (Ipfv.) '1- bya!inu

and they-follow

what they-recite the demons

'i ala mulki sulaymana.

in reign Solomon And they followed what the demons used to recite in Solomon's

reign.

Thus the Imperfective can be used with past time reference, provided
only that it also has imperfective meaning. Summarising the uses of the Imperfective and Perfective, we may say that the Perfective indicates both perfective meaning and relative past time reference, while the Imperfective indicates everything else (i.e. either imperfective meaning
or relative non-past tense). The Arabic opposition Imperfective!
Perfective incorporates both aspect and (relative) tense.1
One naturally wonders how Arabic makes finer time reference dis­ tinctions within the range covered by the Imperfective. In fact, in
the absence of more specific temporal adverbials (and even usually

1 The extent to which aspect or tense i. predominant seems to have changed over the course of the development of Arabic. In Classical Arabic, there
are examples of the Perfective wittt present or future time reference, for instance in wishes and curses : [a'anD-ka 'I/tihu 'may God curse YOll l',
although the use of the Perfective with the specific {l'larker of Future
Tense, sa- or sawja (see below), is excluded even in Classical Arabic.
In modern written Arabic, overt tense markers, as discussed below, are
usual, even in the presence of temporal adverbs, although it still remains
true that the Perfective has perfective relative past meaning, and the
Imperfective either imperfective or relative nonpast meaning. The modern
vernaculars also make these finer tense distinctions, in addition to that
between Perfective and Imperfective.

80

4.4 Combined tense/aspect oppositions
when they are present, especially in the modern written language), Arabic has means of indicating specifically Future Tense and Past Tense of the Imperfective (other Imperfective forms being by elimina­ tion Present). Future Tense is specified by adding sawfa or the prefix sa- before the verb, e.g. sawfa yaktubu or sa-yaktubu ' he will write ' . T o show the Imperfective Past, one combines the Perfective o f the verb ' to be ' (here functioning as an auxiliary) and the Imperfective of the main verb, e.g. ktina yaktubu ' he was writing, used to write ' . The con­ struction is similar to those discussed in section I . 1 .2 where perfective and imperfective forms are combined to indicate both that an action is complete in itself and that it has internal structure. The Arabic form cited might equally be glossed literally as ' it happened (Pfv.) that he be writing (Ipfv.) ', with a past time interpretation assigned to yaktubu because ktina has already specified the tense as Past.
In addition, Arabic has specifically Perfect forms too, formed typically with the particle qad. Thus an explicit Present Perfect uses the particle qad and the Perfective, e.g. qad kataba ' he has written ', the Perfective being used because the verb form also has perfective and past meaning. For Past Perfect, one uses the Perfective of ' to be ' and the Perfective of the main verb (i.e. ' it happened that he wrote '; or rather ' it happened that he had written ', since the Perfective in each case indicates relative past time), with or without qad : ktina (qad) kataba ' he had written '. For the Future Perfect, one uses the Imperfective of ' to be ' with the Perfective of the main verb, again with or w ithout qad : yakunu (qad) kataba ' he will have written ' ; in fact, the Imperfective of ' to be ' regularly functions as a Future Tense, since in the Present Tense Arabic has no overt copula.
An opposition similar to that of Arabic is also found in Chinese ; the examples below are all from Mandarin Chinese, although a similar opposition, using different morphological material, is found in other dialects of Chinese. The opposition is between verbal forms with the suffix -le1 and those lacking this suffix, e.g. for the verb xil • write ',
1 In addition t o the verbal suffix -le, Mandarin Chinese also has a sentence particle -le, attached to the last word in the sentence (not necessarily the verb). The two are different both syntactically and semantically (Chao 1 968 : 246-7. 798-800), and in other dialects of Chinese there are two non-homophonous particles. The sentence-particle -le will not be dis­ cussed here. The account of the verb-suffix -le given here is based on Jaxontov ( 1 957 : I I 5-2 1), although the same uses are noted by Chao ( 1 96 1 : 246-8), who uses the term Perfective for verbs with the suffix
81

Aspect and tense
xiI-le and xil. In many cases the use of -le is optional (this is unlike Arabic, where it is not in general possible to replace the Perfective by the Imperfective), but when it does occur -le indicates a past perfective
situation , e.g. Xiao duizhang xie-le yi-feng xin ' Commander Hsiao
wrote a letter '. Strictly, this is relative rather than absolute past time reference, as can be seen most clearly in a time clause, e.g. n! si-le, wi5 ZUQ heshang ' when you die, I shall become a monk ', i.e. ' once you have died . . . '. In the negative, instead of the suffix -le we find mei(you) before the verb, e.g. la mei(you) Idi ' he didn't come ' ; this is another feature differentiating the verb suffix -le from sentence -le.
Where the reference is to a (relative) present or future situation, the
form without -le is used , e .g. la mai bu ' he sells cloth ' , la mlnglian yao mai bu ' he will sell cloth tomorrow ' (lit. ' he tomorrow want sell cloth ' ) . T o express a relative past situation which is not perfective, this same form is used , with some indicator of time, e.g. la yutinlai mai bU ' he formerly sold cloth (sc . but no longer does so) ' .
4. 5 . Aspect and time reference in tenseless languages In a number of West African languages, including Yoruba
and Igbo, there are no specific markers of past versus present tense, although there are markers of aspect.1 Thus in Yoruba, nonstative verbs have no marker if they have perfective meaning, and the marker n before the verb if they have imperfective meaning.2 Stative verbs have only imperfective meaning, and take no marker. In Igbo, the Imperfec­ tive of nonstative verbs is marked by no before the verb. One might therefore expect that sentences with these various verbal forms would be ambiguous as to time reference. In fact, in the absence of any con­ textual indication of time reference (e.g. a temporal adverbial), the Imperfective forms (simple stative verb or n/nd form of nonstative verb) are interpreted as referring to the present, while the Perfective forms (simple nonstative verb) are interpreted as referring to the past, for
-le. Jaxontov uses the label proIedlee zQverIennoe, i.e. 'past completed', rather than proIedlee soverIennoe ('past perfective'), the usual term in dis­ cussions of Slavonic languages, but notes explicitly that the uses of the Chinese forms with the verb-suffix -le are essentially the same as those of the Perfective Past in Russian. 1 Welmers ( 1 973 : 345-,]), from whom most of the examples below are taken. t Some dialects of Yoruba further distinguish a Habitual with different markers, in which case the ri forms are more specifically Progressive.

4.5 Aspect and time reference
instance : Yoruba 0 R owo, Igbo 9 cqro e'gIJ ' he wants money ' ; Yoruba o n #��, Igbo 9 na ar� r;'r¥ ' he is working, he works (habitually) ' ; Yoruba 0 wd, Igbo 9 byara ' he came ' . Only in the presence of an overt indication of time would the Imperfective forms be interpreted as referring to the past : Yoruba 0 n #�� l'dna, Igbo 9 na ar¥ q'r¥ eci ' he was working yesterday '. Thus there is a close relationship between Imperfective Aspect and present time, and between Perfective Aspect and past time, in these languages without tense markers.1 This is not too dissimilar from the situation in Arabic, discussed in section 4.4, where there is a set of forms incorporating both Past Tense and Perfec­ tive Aspect.
It is not unlikely that a very similar system obtained at a late stage in the prehistoric development of Indo-European, with aspect being marked overtly and time reference at best a secondary consequence of aspectual distinctions. If we neglect the future tense, which is a relatively late and language-particular development within the Indo-European languages, and also, for convenience, the Perfect, which does not enter into this particular argument, then it has often been assumed that Indo-European had three categories, the Present, Imperfect, and Aorist. Now, while the distinction between Present and Aorist and the forms of either can clearly be traced back to Proto-Indo-European, the same cannot be said of the Imperfect, for which the allegedly Indo-European formation with the augment and Present stem (e.g. Ancient Greek ephere ' he was carrying, he used to carry ') is attested only in Indo-Iranian, Greek, and Hittite.2 Latin and Balto-Slavonic have quite different formations (different also from one another), while Germanic falls outside this system by having a Past Tense undifferentiated for aspect. Thus it seems that Proto-Indo-European lacked the Imperfect, i.e. a special form combining imperfective aspect and past time reference. In ascertaining whether the tense or the aspect distinction was earlier, one may look at the formation of the separate Imperfects in the various languages : in each of the language groups mentioned above with an Imperfect/Aorist distinction, the Imperfect is formed from the so-called
1 Welmers ( 1 973 : 246-7) refers to this kind of usage as 'factative', i.e. the construction in question 'expresses the most obvious fact about the verb in question, which in the case of active [i.e. nonstative-B.C.] verbs is that the action was observed or took place, but for stative verbs [and Imperfective nonst&tive verbs-RC.] is that the situation obtains at present'.
I Kurylowicz ( 1 964 : 1 34).

Aspect and tense
Present stem (not the Aorist stem), with some other indicator of Past Tense (e.g. the augment e-) ; whence the characterisation of the Imper­ fect as the ' Present in the Past '. The nature of the Imperfect, both synchronically and diachronically, becomes clearer if one thinks not of Present stem versus Aorist stem, but of Imperfective stem versus Perfective stem : the Perfective stem is, in isolation, usually interpreted as referring to the past (whence the Aorist) ; the Imperfective stem in isolation is usually interpreted as referring to the present, and to specify the combination of imperfective and past time meaning some additional marker is needed, such as the various additions to the Imperfective stem that are found in the individual languages to mark the Imperfect.
4.6. Aspect and voice In many languages, in particular in many Indo-European
languages, there are interrelations between aspect and voice (active versus passive). Since these relations are less fully discussed in the literature on aspect than are relations between aspect and tense, some space will be devoted to them here.
In a number of languages, overt expression of perfect meaning is possible only in the passive voice, and not in the active. In Russian, for instance, a sentence like kon'jak vypit means explicitly ' the brandy has been drunk ', and not ' the brandy was drunk ', which would be kon'Jak byl vypit ; but this distinction cannot be made in the active voice, where on vypil kon'jak corresponds to both ' he drank the brandy ' and ' he has drunk the brandy '. The distinction is thus maintained only in the passive, or rather certain tenses of the passive.! A similar situation obtains in Irish, where the Simple Past, rather like the Russian Perfec­ tive Past, can have either perfect or nonperfect force : an bhfacais fris e? ' have you seen him yet? ', an bhfacais an paipear inne? ' did you see the paper yesterday? ', with the verb form facals (mutated to bhfacais after an) in both examples. However, there is also a specifically Perfect form, using the Past Participle Passive, just as in Russian : ta an dinnear ite ag Tomds 'Tom has eaten dinner ' (literally ' dinner is having-been-eaten (ite) by Tom '). Once again, a distinct perfect can be maintained only in the passive. The only difference between Russian and Irish here seems to be the greater tendency in Irish to give overt expression to this perfect meaning by using the passive construction, whereas Russian
1 For further discussion of the Russian Passive, including its interaction with aspect, see Harrison ( 1 967).

4.6 Aspect and voice

has a greater tendency to neutralise the semantic distinction by using

the active Perfective Past.

One of the disadvantages of this particular relationship between

aspect and voice is that the perfect can be maintained as an overtly

distinct category only with verbs that have a passive, i.e., for the

majority of Indo-European languages, transitive verbs. This system

may be compared with the slightly different relation between aspect and

voice found, for instance, in the Indo-Iranian languages. Although Indo­

Iranian inherited from Indo-European a three-way distinction among

the simple past tenses, between Imperfect, Aorist, and Perfect, there is

a tendency from the earliest period for new compound tenses to arise

based on the Past Participle Passive, especially in the Perfect, on the

basis of passive constructions like Sanskrit tenedam uktam (i.e. tena

n' beyutehri)m,)'

'

idam ' this (neuter) ' uktam this was said by him ' . The

' said (Past important

Participle difference

Passive, vis-a.-vis

Slavonic or Irish is that in Indo-Iranian the Past Passive Participle can

also be formed from intransitive verbs, and has active meaning, so that

corresponding in aspect (though not in voice) to tenedam uktam we have

also in Sanskrit sa mrtal;z ' he has died '. The system is still not fully in

equilibrium, because in order to express Perfect Aspect in this way, one

must in the one case use an active construction (with intransitive verbs),

in the other a passive construction (with transitive verbs). In the later

development of this construction in Indo-Iranian there are two main

changes. The one is the spread of this, originally periphrastic Perfect,

construction so that it becomes the basic past tense construction : in

most modern Indo-Iranian languages there is no trace of the Indo­

European simple past tenses, but only descendants of originally

periphrastic constructions with the Past Participle. The other change is

the reanalysis of the Sanskrit-type passive tenedam uktam as an active,

i.e. what was originally the subject of a passive construction is reinter­

preted as direct object of an active construction, and the earlier passive

agent is reinterpreted as subject of an active construction. This gives

rise to the kind of construction known as the ergative, in which the

morphological marking of the subject of a transitive verb differs from

that of an intransitive verb, the latter being the same as the direct object

of a transitive verb, and where moreover the verb often agrees with the

direct object rather than with the subject, e.g. Hindi aurat cali hai ' the

woman has gone ' (literally ' woman (nominative) gone (feminine) is'),

but larke ne kitab likhi hai ' the boy has written a book ' (literally ' boy

Aspect and tense
ergative book (nominative) written (feminine)l is '). The final step is for even this trace of the original passive construction to be lost, so that derivatives of the original periphrastic Perfect Passive take their subject in the nominative and direct object in the accusative, there being no ergative construction j this stage is exemplified by Modern Persian : zan raft ' the woman went ' (literally ' woman (nominative) went '), pesar ketab ra xarid ' the boy bought the book ' (literally ' boy (nomina­ tive) book accusative bought').
One naturally goes on to ask why this particular relation between perfect aspect and passive voice is found.2 The perfect relates a past action to a present state, i.e. can express a present state as being the result of some past action. The older forms of the passive in many languages are likewise stative.3 When an action involving an agent and an object takes place, the resultant change in state is usually more apparent in the object than in the agent, as in the enemy has destroyed the city. With transitive verbs, therefore, the most usual state resulting from an action will be the changed state of the semantic object of the action, in the example given a change in the state of the city. The perfect passive is precisely that form which predicates a change of state to the object of an action. With intransitive verbs, the change of state is apparent in the agent, so the active voice is appropriate : John has arrived.
1 In Hindi, kitiib 'book' is feminine. 2 The explanation given here is based on the discussion in Kurylowicz
( 1 964 : 56-89). Although the present discussion is limited to periphrastic forms using the Indo-European Past Participle and their derivatives, Kurylowicz notes essentially the same phenomenon with regard to the Indo-European Perfect, typically active with intransitive verbs but passive with transitive verbs at an earlier period. • For instance, the German construction das Haus ist gebaut 'the house is (i.e. has been) built' is older than das Haus wird gebaut 'the house is being built' ; further examples a re given by Kurylowicz ( 1 964 : 56-89).

Formal expression of aspectual
oppositions
5. I . Morphology of aspect 5 . 1 .0. It is not the aim of the present chapter to look in detail at the morphology of any one language or group of languages, since morphological information of this kind can readily be obtained from grammars of the individual languages, and is not in itself of interest to the study of the functioning of aspect within language systems as a whole. Rather, the aim of the present chapter is to look at recurring features, both morphological and syntactic, in the formal expression of aspectual oppositions, and especially features that recur in languages that are not related to one another and are widely separated geographic­ ally from one another ; it will also be our aim to look at those features of aspectual morphology within individual languages that seem to have some bearing on the semantic functioning of the aspectual systems of these languages. The first major division that can be made in ways of formally express­ ing aspectual oppositions in languages is between morphological (synthetic) and syntactic (analytic) means. Although there may be individual cases where it is difficult to decide whether a given formation is primarily morphological or syntactic, in the vast majority of cases the distinction can be drawn, and this forms a useful starting-point for our classification. A clear example of syntactic expression of aspect is in the Progressive Aspect of Yoruba, of the type d n liIe ' he is working ', literally ' he in work ', where the verbal construction is like that of an adverbial phrase.1 Similarly, the Progressive in English would fall under this heading, as in I am working, with the construction Copula verb + Predicate ; even clearer is the French Progressive paraphrase je mu en train de travail/er, literally ' I am in (the) process of working ' .

Formal expression of aspectual oppositions
return to syntactic expressions of aspectual oppositions later in this chapter.
Among languages that do have morphological means of expressing aspectual oppositions, we may make a distinction between those languages where there is a clearly identifiable marker of aspect (or of one member of an aspectual opposition), the forms of the verb being otherwise the same for both aspects, and those languages where this is not so. Clear examples of the former type arc languages with an invari­ able affix indicating aspect, such as Chinese -zhe (Progressive) and Persian mi- (Imperfective). Prefixation as a marker of Perfective Aspect in Slavonic and Baltic languages, and also in Georgian, is a similar process, though slightly less systematic, in that the choice of prefix is often lexically determined (e.g. the Perfective of Russian atat' ' read ' is pro-atat', whereas the Perfective of pisat' ' write ' is na-pisat'), and may also modify the meaning of the verb in accordance with the meaning of the prefix elsewhere in derivational morphology ; in Slavonic and, to a lesser extent, in Baltic (but not in Georgian) there also exists a derivational process of imperfectivisation, whereby Imperfective verbs can be derived by suffixation from prefixed Perfectives (cp. section 5. 1 . 1 ).
5 . 1 . 1 . Prefixing in Balto-Slavonic, Georgian, and Hungarian In view of the importance of the Slavonic aspectual system
in discussions of aspect in general linguistics, it is perhaps worth spending some time in looking at the morphology of this system, both as it functions in the modern languages (especially Russian),l and historically.2 From the viewpoint of the genesis of the aspectual system, a diachronic comparison may be made with the Baltic languages, and a typological comparison may be made with Georgian.
The Slavonic languages, like the older Indo-European languages generally, had originally a perfective/imperfective distinction in the Past Tense, in the Aorist/lmperfect opposition, although these forms have been lost in the majority of the modern Slavonic languages (with the exception of Bulgarian, Macedonian, and some forms of Serbo­ Croatian and Sorbian). The current distinction between the Perfective and Imperfective, not restricted to Past Tense, is however a Slavonic

5 . 1 Morphology of aspect
innovation, shared partly with the closely related Baltic languages, and without any systematic parallel in the other branches of Indo-European. In the modern languages Perfectives are formed from Imperfectives primarily by prefixing, less commonly by suffixing. The vast majority of prefixes used for this purpose have their origin in prepositions and/or adverbs, and as such are similar in origin to such particles as up in English drink up (cp. drink), or the German prefix auf- in auftrinken ' drink up ' (cp. trinken ' drink '), or the Latin prefix con- in conficere ' complete ' (cp. facere ' do, make '), although in these languages, in contrast to Slavonic, there is no systematic opposition of Perfective and Imperfective.
At an early stage in the development of the Slavonic languages, it is probable that prefixing a simple verb did not in itself lead to perfectivi­ sation, and Modern Russian still contains a number of prefixed simple verbs without perfective meaning, often borrowed from Old Church Slavonic, the earliest attested Slavonic language, e.g. pred-videt' ' foresee ', so-stojat' ' consist '. Subsequently, certain prefixal usages came to be interpreted as specifically perfective, although the opposition Perfective/ Imperfective was certainly not yet a fully developed system offering two aspectual forms for all (or nearly all) verbs, so that those verbs that did not have specifically prefixed forms had no specifically Perfective forms. In some such cases of prefixation, the difference in meaning was purely aspectual (especially with po-, the most neutral prefix semantically) ; elsewhere, the addition of the prefix, in addition to changing the aspect of the verb, also changed its meaning, as in the relation between rezat' , cut ' and ot-rezat' ' cut-off ', raz-rezat' ' cut-up ', etc. For certain verbs where, in the modern language, the prefix is simply aspectual, it is possible that at an earlier period there was also a semantic difference, or at least that the prefix, though semantically non-empty, simply reiterated some inherent semantic feature of the verb, as with na-pisat' ' write ' (i.e. ' write on '), pro-citat' ' read ' (i.e. ' read through '). Only where the prefix adds nothing to the meaning of the Imperfective verb other than perfective meaning do we have strict aspectual pairs.l At this stage, then, we have basically simple unprefixed verbs, which are neutral as to aspect, but may be strictly interpreted as Imperfective when they are in
1 In current discussions of Russian aspect, there is much controversy over just how many such aspectual pairs, with semantically empty prefixes, there are, and a particularly negative attitude is taken by Isal!enko ( 1 962 : 3 5 8-63 , and passim) ; for discussion, see Forsyth ( 1 970 : 36-43).

opposition to a Perfective,1 and prefixed verbs which are for the most part Perfective ; some Imperfective verbs will not have a semantically equivalent Perfective, since they may not be used with any prefix that does not affect the lexical meaning of the verb, while many Perfective verbs (all of those that are formed with meaning-changing prefixes) have no specific Imperfective counterpart.
The next stage in the systematisation of the aspectual opposition was the development of Imperfective equivalents specific to those Perfectivcs with semantically non-empty prefixes, and this was achieved by means of suffixal derivatives of the prefixed Perfectives ; these have purely aspectual value. Examples are Old Church Slavonic iz-bavl-j-ati (for *iz-bav-jati), the Imperfective of iz-bav-iti ' save ', and Russian ot-rez­ yv-at' ' cut off', the Imperfective of ot-rez-at' mentioned above. Diagrammatically, the development of the aspectual system can be represented as in table 2, where the forms lower down the page are those that developed later in the history of the formation of aspectual pairs.
In Modern Russian, then, Perfective/Imperfective pairs are related primarily either by the Perfective being a prefixed derivative of the Imperfective, or by the Imperfective being a suffixal derivative of the Perfective, the latter more particularly where the verb has a semantically non-empty prefix.
If we look at the other languages mentioned above, we find aspectual systems that are very like that of Slavonic as it was at an earlier period. Thus in the Germanic languages there are some prefixed verbs that can have perfective meaning, but there is no systematic pairing of forms with perfective and imperfective meaning, and in general no way of deriving forms with imperfective meaning from verbs with perfective meaning.2

to denote in some Germanic languages perfective meaning, but outside
