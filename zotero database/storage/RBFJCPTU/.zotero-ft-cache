Learning About Language is an exciting and ambitious series of introductions to fundamental topics in language, linguistics and related areas. The books are designed for students of linguistics and those who are studying language as part of a wider course.
Cognitive linguistics explores the idea that language reflects our experience of the world. It shows that our ability to use language is closely related to other cognitive abilities such as categorization, perception, memory and attention allocation. Concepts and mental images expressed and evoked by linguistic means are linked by conceptual metaphors and metonymies and merged into more comprehensive cognitive and cultural models, frames or scenarios. It is only against this background that human communication makes sense. After 25 years of intensive research, cognitive-linguistic thinking now holds a firm place both in the wider linguistic and cognitive-science communities.
An Introduction to Cognitive Linguistics carefully explains the central concepts of categorization, of prototype and gestalt perception, of basic level and conceptual hierarchies, of figure and ground, and of metaphor and metonymy, for which an innovative description is provided. It also brings together issues such as iconicity, lexical change, grammaticalization and language teaching that have profited considerably from being put on a cognitive basis.
The second edition of this popular introduction provides a comprehensive and accessible up-to-date overview of cognitive linguistics: • It clarifies the basic notions supported by new evidence and examples for their
application in language learning • Discusses major recent developments in the field: the increasing attention paid to
metonymies, Construction Grammar, Conceptual Blending and its role in online-processing • Explores links with neighbouring fields like Relevance Theory • Uses many diagrams and illustrations to make the theoretical argument more tangible • Includes extended exercises • Provides substantial updated suggestions for further reading.

Preface to the second edition
This new edition of the book is more than the usual update of information and references. In response to recent developments in cognitive linguistics we have made some major changes and have introduced new topics extending the number of chapters from six to seven.
Our presentation of conceptual categorization has become more differentiated. With regard to individual categories, the notion of contextdependence has been strengthened. The presentation of cognitive models and cognitive hierarchies now emphasizes the importance of part-whole links as opposed to type-of relationships.
The third chapter now provides an innovative description of the role played by metaphors and metonymies based on the notion of ‘mapping scope’. Generally metonymy has been given more prominence to accommodate recent research; the section on ‘Metaphor as a way of thinking’ has been complemented by an additional section ‘Thinking in metonymies’c.
While Chapter 5 includes a section on ‘Construction Grammar’, a new Chapter 6 has been inserted providing a careful introduction of blending theory as an online processing strategy. The chapter includes many detailed analyses of lexical and grammatical phenomena, and also of ads, riddles and jokes. The last section of this chapter takes a look at ‘Relevance Theory’ exploring its potential to stimulate cognitive-linguistic approaches.
The final chapter of the book has almost doubled in size as two of the four sections, the sections on iconicity and on cognitive linguistics in foreign language learning, have been massively expanded and now contain a large amount of new material and original ideas.
The conclusion of the first edition has been reshaped into an ‘Outlook’ section which surveys some current attempts to put linguistic theorizing on a safer psychological and neurological footing.

Introduction
If someone says to you ‘Our car has broken down’, your reaction may simply be to feel sorry. For the linguist, though, even such a simple utterance calls for quite an elaborate explanation. As far as the meaning and the grammar of the sentence are concerned, a traditional description would try to paraphrase the meanings of the words used; it would analyze the clause pattern (here a simple combination of subject and verb or predicate), and would probably go on to discuss the use of the present perfect tense. Another approach involves asking language users to describe what is going on in their minds when they produce and understand words and sentences. As experiments have shown, people will not only state that a car has a boxlike shape, that it has wheels, doors, and windows, that it is driven by an engine and equipped with a steering wheel, an accelerator and brakes, and that it has seats for the driver and the passengers – more likely than not, they will also mention that a car is comfortable and fast, that it offers mobility, independence and perhaps social status. Some people may connect the notion of car with their first love affair, or with injury if they were once involved in an accident. By adding these attributes, people include associations and impressions which are part of their experience. While the last two items (‘first love affair’, ‘injury’) point to a very personal, subjective experience, attributes like ‘comfort’, ‘speed’, ‘mobility’ and ‘independence’ seem to be part of our communal experience of cars. Taken together, the attributes collected from laypersons seem to reflect the way we perceive the world around us and interact with it. The wide and varied experience that we have of cars is also helpful when it comes to identifying and naming car-like objects that we encounter for the first time. For example, we do not hesitate to use the word car for vehicles with only three wheels or strange-looking safari jeeps, because

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

we can compare them with the idea of a typical car we have stored in our minds. In other words, a description that takes account of our experience of the world – or more technically, an experiential view of words and other linguistic structures – seems to provide a rich and fairly natural description of their meanings, and this is one of the goals of the cognitive-linguistic approach presented in this book.
Experiential aspects of meaning do not only emerge in experiments and personal interviews. Our shared experience of the world is also stored in our everyday language and can thus be gleaned from the way we express our ideas. In order to open this mine, however, we have to go beyond the ‘logic’ of clause patterns and examine figurative language, especially metaphors. Looking again at our initial example Our car has broken down, it is evident that a car does not really break down just like a chair collapses so that its parts come apart. Nevertheless the conceptual background of this expression is clear enough. Since most of us do not know an awful lot about cars and how they work, we use our knowledge of chairs or other equally familiar objects collapsing to understand what happens when the car’s engine suddenly stops working.
This transfer of our experience of well-known objects and events is even more important where abstract categories like emotions are involved. Imagine that someone describes the car owner’s reaction to the breakdown of his car with the words Dad exploded. In order to get a full grasp of this utterance and the notion of anger expressed, we will call up our knowledge of actual explosions of gas stoves, fireworks and even bombs. This means that we will make use of our experience of the concrete world around us. Considering the wealth of observations, impressions and associations underlying metaphors, it is not surprising that they have joined tests and interviews as the second major basis of the experiential view of language.
Another important aspect of linguistic utterances concerns the selection and arrangement of the information that is expressed. For example, consider the sentence The car crashed into the tree which might be a description of the circumstances that led to the car’s breakdown. Visualizing the accident situation sketched in this example, you will probably agree that the sentence seems to describe the situation in a fairly natural way. In comparison, other ways of relating the accident such as The tree was hit by the car seem somehow strange and unnatural. The reason is that the moving car is the most interesting and prominent aspect of the whole situation, and therefore we tend to begin the sentence with the noun phrase the car. What this explanation claims is that the selection of the clause subject is determined by the different degrees of prominence carried by the elements

involved in a situation. This prominence is not just reflected in the selection of the subject as opposed to the object and the adverbials of a clause, but there are also many other applications of what may be called the prominence view of linguistic structures.
The prominence view provides one explanation of how the information in a clause is selected and arranged. An alternative approach is based on the assumption that what we actually express reflects which parts of an event attract our attention, and it can therefore be called the attentional view. Returning once more to the road accident, the sentence The car crashed into the tree selects only a small section of the event that we probably conjure up in our minds: how the car started to swerve, how it skidded across the road and rumbled onto the verge. Although all this happened before the car hit the tree, it is not mentioned because our attention is focused on the crucial point where the path of the car ended, i.e. when the vehicle collided with the tree, resulting in a severely damaged car and most likely causing injuries to its passengers. Analyzing the sentence in terms of attention allocation, the attentional view explains why one stage of the event is expressed in the sentence and why other stages are not.
The experiential, the prominence and the attentional view are three interlocking ways of approaching language via its relation to the world around us, which between them describe the core areas of cognitive linguistics. An additional aspect that has increasingly captured the attention of cognitive linguists is concerned with the mental processing of cognitive input, and in particular with the online processing of our conceptualizations. To add another example from the field of vehicles, consider the slogan of an advertising campaign for a well-known brand of cars: Unleash a Jaguar. Exploiting the origin of the brand name, this ad brings together ideas from the two conceptual domains of cars and wild animals; it amalgamates them into a powerful message suggesting an image of a car that is impatiently waiting for the customer, to be set free and allowed to act out its power, speed and ferocity. This happens although the relationships between the wild animal domain and the car domain are not really clarified, let alone permanently fixed. Technically speaking, the expression Unleash a Jaguar instructs the readers to simultaneously construct two ‘mental spaces’: a ‘car’ space containing associations like powerful engine, high maximum speed, attractive design, etc.; and a ‘wild animal’ space including associations normally attributed to jaguars, such as their ferocity, speed of running, litheness and elegance. To understand the message of the slogan, readers have to go through a process of conceptually blending the two mental spaces, a process resulting in a blended notion of ‘car-as-a-wild-animal’. With regard to its meaning, this

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

conceptual blend is somewhat vague and open-ended, and it is this quality that is exploited in ads and many other text-types.
If these examples and their analysis have provided you with a first impression of cognitive linguistics, you should perhaps now proceed to the individual chapters of the book to find out more about the issues raised. The remaining part of the introduction is primarily addressed to readers who are already more familiar with cognitive linguistics and want to get a concise overview of the topics dealt with in the book and their research background.
The first of the seven chapters will pursue the experiential view by looking at early psychological studies of cognitive categories (most of them conducted by Eleanor Rosch), which led to the prototype model of categorization. This will take us to a discussion of attributes, family resemblances and gestalts. Contrary to what one might assume, prototypes and cognitive categories are not static, but shift with the context in which a word is used and depend on the cognitive and cultural models stored in our mind.
The second chapter concentrates on the predominance of the ‘middle’ level of categorization, called basic level. It is argued that basic level categories for objects and organisms, such as DOG, RABBIT or KNIFE, are cognitively more important than either superordinate categories like ANIMAL or CUTLERY or subordinate categories like GREYHOUND or PENKNIFE, but it will also be shown that part–whole relationships like TABLE–KITCHEN–HOUSE–TOWN are just as important for the organization of our mental lexicon as the typeof hierarchies (GREYHOUND–DOG–ANIMAL) traditionally focused on. The notion of basic level categories can also be transferred from organisms and objects to the domain of actions. For the description of properties, it competes with another cognitive notion, the image schema, which is rooted in our bodily experiences.
Still within the framework of the experiential view, the third chapter starts out from the conceptual potential of metaphors (which was first pointed out by Lakoff and Johnson and has already been illustrated for the breakdown of the car). As a cognitive process it is understood as a mapping from a source to a target concept monitored by a conceptual mapping scope. Together with metonymies, conceptual metaphors make a significant contribution to the cognitive content and structure of abstract categories, especially emotion categories.
This view implies that metaphors and metonymies are no longer regarded as ornamental figures of speech (as in traditional stylistics), but are understood as important conceptual tools. The category-structuring power of metaphors is not restricted to lexical categories, but can also contribute

to our understanding of complex scientific, political and social issues, and this is also true of metonymies, whose fundamental importance for human thinking has only been gradually realized.
The fourth chapter is devoted to the prominence view. At the heart of this approach lies the principle of figure/ground segregation, which has its origin in the work on visual perception by gestalt psychologists. This principle is first applied to locative relations underlying prepositions like out or over. Then it is extended to describe other syntactic relations, in particular the prominence of subject versus object. The chapter ends with a rough sketch of Langacker’s view of cognitive processes, which is shown to be based on a multiple application of the figure–ground contrast.
In the fifth chapter the potential of the attentional view will be demonstrated. The chapter (which owes much to the ideas of Fillmore, Talmy and Slobin) starts out from the notion of ‘frame’. Basically, a frame is an assemblage of the knowledge we have about a certain situation, e.g. buying and selling. Depending on where we direct our attention, we can select and highlight different aspects of the frame, thus arriving at different linguistic expressions. Although elementary types of frames, for instance the ‘motion event-frame’, are presumably shared by all human beings, they are expressed in different ways in different languages; this will be illustrated with English, German, French and Spanish examples. Closely related to event-frames is the notion of construction as a meaningful linguistic element, which, following mainly Fillmore and Goldberg, is exemplified for verbal and nominal constructions as well as syntactic idioms.
The sixth chapter deals with the analysis of online cognitive processing, as represented by Fauconnier and Turner’s theory of conceptual blending. This approach is applied to a wide range of lexical, grammatical and pragmatic phenomena as well as to ads, riddles and jokes to test its versatility. For example, it explains how we bring together information expressed in the headline of a print ad with the message of the picture by linking and blending the mental spaces evoked by them. Finally, the blending theory and other cognitive principles are related to some of the tenets of Sperber and Wilson’s Relevance Theory, which is characterized as a cognitive-pragmatic approach capable of stimulating cognitive-linguistic thinking.
The seventh chapter brings together a number of issues that have not originated in cognitive-linguistic research. Although three of them, iconicity, lexical change and grammaticalization, can look back on a long tradition in linguistics, they have benefited considerably from being put on a cognitive basis. The final section discusses the potential of a cognitive

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

approach to foreign language learning, focusing on the potential of basic level, metaphor and metonymy, figure and ground as well as gestalt, to facilitate cognitive access to the language learning process.
To return to the general question of how ‘cognitive linguistics’ can be understood, the book will focus on the experiential aspects and the principles of prominence and attention allocation underlying language. By including cognitive online processing we want to emphasize the ties linking cognitive linguistics to psycholinguistic and pragmatic approaches.

CHAPTER 1
Prototypes and categories
1.1 Colours, squares, birds and cups: early empirical research into lexical categories
The world consists of an infinite variety of objects with different substances, shapes and colours. How do we translate this variety into manageable word meanings and why do we succeed even where no clear-cut distinctions seem to be available, such as between the colours ‘red’ and ‘orange’ or ‘green’ and ‘blue’? Experimental psychology has shown that we use focal or prototypical colours as points of orientation, and comparable observations have also been made with categories denoting shapes, animals, plants and man-made objects.
Moving through the world we find ourselves surrounded by a variety of different phenomena. The most eye-catching among them are organisms and objects: people, animals, plants and all kinds of everyday artefacts such as books, chairs, cars and houses. In normal circumstances we have no difficulty in identifying and classifying any of them, and in attributing appropriate class names to them. However, it is not so easy to identify, classify and, as a consequence, to name other types of entities, for instance parts of organisms. Knees, ankles and feet of human beings and animals or the trunk, branches and twigs of a tree belong to this type. It may be fairly clear that one’s kneecap belongs to one’s knee and that the trunk of a tree includes the section which grows out of the ground. Yet at which point does one’s knee end and where does one’s thigh start? Where does a trunk turn into a treetop and where does a branch turn into a twig? Similar problems arise with landscape names, and words denoting weather phenomena. Who can tell at which particular spot a valley is no longer a valley but a slope or a mountain? Who can reliably identify the point where drizzle turns into rain, rain into snow, where mist or fog begins or ends?
When we compare the two types of entities mentioned, we find that they differ with respect to their boundaries. Books, tables, cars and houses

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

are clearly delimited objects. In contrast, the boundaries of entities like knee, trunk, valley and mist are far from clear; they are vague. This vagueness has troubled philosophers and linguists interested in the relationship between word meanings and extra-linguistic reality, and has given rise to various theories of vagueness’.* Yet in spite of their vagueness, we have the impression that these boundaries exist in reality. A kneecap cannot be included in the thigh, and a mountain top will never be part of a valley. So classification seems to be forced upon us by the boundaries provided by reality.
However, there are phenomena in the world where this is not the case. Take physical properties such as length, width, height, temperature and colours, all of them uninterrupted scales extending between two extremes – how do we know where to draw the line between cold, warm and hot water? And how do we manage to distribute the major colour terms available in English across the 7,500,000 colour shades which we are apparently able to discriminate (see Brown and Lenneberg 1954: 457)? The temperature scale and the colour continuum do not provide natural divisions which could be compared with the boundaries of books, cars, and even knees or valleys.
Therefore the classification of temperature and colours can only be conceived as a mental process, and it is hardly surprising that physical properties, and colours especially, have served as the starting point for the psychological and conceptual view of word meanings which is at the heart of cognitive linguistics. This mental process of classification (whose complex nature will become clearer as we go on) is commonly called categorization, and its product are the cognitive categories, e.g. the colour categories RED, YELLOW, GREEN and BLUE, etc. (another widely used term is ‘concept’).
What are the principles guiding the mental process of categorization and, more specifically, of colour categorization? One explanation is that colour categories are totally arbitrary. For a long time this was what most researchers in the field believed. In the 1950s and 1960s, anthropologists investigated crosslinguistic differences in colour naming and found that colour terms differed enormously between languages (Brown and Lenneberg 1954; Lenneberg 1967). This was interpreted as a proof of the arbitrary nature of colour categories. More generally, it was thought to support the relativist view of languages, which, in its strongest version as advocated by Whorf, assumes that different languages carve up reality in totally different ways.2
A second explanation might be that the colour continuum is structured by a system of reference points for orientation. And indeed, the anthropologists Brent Berlin and Paul Kay (1969) found evidence that we rely on

so-called focal colours for colour categorization. Berlin and Kay’s main target was to refute the relativist hypothesis by establishing a hierarchy of focal colours which could be regarded as universal. To support the universalist claim they investigated 98 languages, 20 in oral tests and the rest based on grammars and other written materials. In retrospect, their typological findings, which in fact have not remained uncriticized, have lost some of their glamour. However, the notion of focal colours, which emerged from the experiments, now appears as one of the most important steps on the way to the prototype model of categorization. We will therefore confine our account of Berlin and Kay’s work to aspects relevant for the prototype model, at the expense of typological details.3
Focal colours
Like other researchers before them, Berlin and Kay worked with so-called Munsell colour chips provided by a company of the same name. These chips are standardized for the three dimensions which are relevant for our perception of different colours, namely hue, brightness and saturation, of which mainly the first two were tested. The advantage of using such standardized colour samples rather than pieces of dyed cloth is that anthropological and psychological tests become more objective, since they can be repeated by other researchers and the findings of different tests can be compared. The set of chips used by Berlin and Kay was composed of 329 colour chips, 320 of which represented 40 different colours, or, more precisely, 40 hues, each divided up into eight different levels of brightness. The remaining nine chips were white, black, and seven levels of grey. The chips were set out on a card in the manner shown in Figure 1.1. The vertical axis in the figure displays the various shades of brightness of one identical hue. On the horizontal axis the chips are ordered in such a way that starting from red the hues move through yellow-red to yellow through green-yellow to green and so on.
With the help of the colour card Berlin and Kay set about testing how speakers of the 20 selected languages categorized colours. In doing so, they were not so much interested in the colour vocabulary in general, but rather in a particular set of colour terms which met the following criteria: the terms should consist of just one word of native origin (as opposed to greenish-blue and turquoise); their application should not be restricted to a narrow class of objects (as opposed, e.g., to English and German blond); the words should come to mind readily and should be familiar to all or at least to most speakers of a language (as opposed to, say, vermilion, magenta or indigo).

Colour terms which fulfilled these criteria were called basic colour terms. In the first stage of the experiments, Berlin and Kay collected the basic colour terms of the 20 languages. This was achieved by means of a ‘verbal elicitation test’, which is just a more complicated way of saying that speakers of the respective languages were asked to name them. In the second stage, these speakers were shown the colour card and asked to point out

1. all those chips which [they] would under any conditions call x

2. the best, most typical examples of x.

(Berlin and Kay 1969: 7)

The questions show that, unlike Lenneberg and other anthropologists before them, Berlin and Kay were not only interested in the extension of colour categories, but also in their best examples. One might even say that what was later called ‘prototype’ is anticipated in the wording of their second question.
What were Berlin and Kay’s findings? In categorizing colours, people rely on certain points in the colour space for orientation. For example, when speakers of English were asked for the best example of the colour ‘red’, they consistently pointed to colour chips in the lower, i.e. darker, regions under the label ‘red’ (f3 and g3 in Figure 1.1; of course, in the tests no colour terms were given on the card). For yellow, informants consistently selected chips with the second degree of brightness under the label ‘yellow’ (b9 in Figure 1.1). These chips (or regions in the colour space), which were thought of as best examples by all or by most speakers of English, were called ‘foci’ by Berlin and Kay.

Foci or focal colours were also found for the other 19 languages. When the focal colours were compared, the result was amazing. Focal colours are not only shared by the speakers of one and the same language but they are also very consistent across different languages. Whenever a language has colour terms roughly corresponding to the English colour terms, their focal points will be in the same area. And even in languages with a smaller number of basic colour terms than English, the best examples of these fewer categories will agree with the respective focal colours of ‘richer’ languages like English.
In sum, there is compelling evidence that instead of being arbitrary, colour categorization is anchored in focal colours. While the boundaries of colour categories vary between languages and even between speakers of one language, focal colours are shared by different speakers and even different language communities.
As is often the case with important scientific findings, the discovery of focal colours not only helped to solve one problem but also raised a number of new questions. Are focal colours to be treated as a phenomenon which is a matter of language or of the mind? What, assuming the latter, is their psychological status? And finally, are ‘foci’ (focal points) restricted to colours or can they be found in other areas as well? These questions will be taken up in the following sections.
The psychological background of focal colours
From a psychological standpoint the categorization of natural phenomena is a rather complex task involving the following processes:4
1. Selection of stimuli Of the wealth of stimuli which are perceived by our sensory systems (visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory), only very few are selected for cognitive processing, i.e. they attract our attention.
2. Identification and classification This is achieved by comparing selected stimuli to relevant knowledge stored in memory.
3. Naming Most cognitive categories are given names though some remain unlabelled, e.g. ‘things to eat on a diet’, ‘things to pack in a suitcase’. (Barsalou 1987: 102)
Most of these aspects were investigated by Eleanor Rosch, who in the early 1970s set out to explore the psychological background of focal colours.5 As a psychologist, her primary aim was to find out whether focal colours were rooted in language or in pre-linguistic cognition. Her idea was that a cognitive status might be claimed for focal colours if they could be proved to be prominent in the cognitive processes involved in categorization.

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

Starting out from the most basic of the three cognitive processes, Rosch first examined whether focal colours are perceptually salient. To eliminate the influence of purely language-based categorization, she required informants who had stored as little knowledge of colour names and related colour categories as possible. So she decided to work with pre-school children and with members of a non-Westernized culture in Papua New Guinea, the Dani. Earlier research had shown that Dugum Dani, the language spoken by the Dani, contained only two basic colour terms, in contrast to the 11 basic colour terms available to speakers of English (Heider 1971). Like children, the Dani were therefore particularly well suited as uncorrupted informants for colour-categorizing experiments. English-speaking adults, who were supposed to have the full system of basic colour terms at their disposal, were only used as control groups in some of the tests.
Rosch’s first experiment (Heider 1971), which was to test the arousal of attention (or stimulus selection), was dressed up as a ‘show me a colour’ game. She gave 3-year-old children arrays of colour chips consisting of one focal colour, as found by Berlin and Kay, and seven other chips of the same hue, but other levels of brightness. The children were told that they were to show the experimenter any colour they liked. The reasoning behind this game was that young children’s attention would be attracted more readily by focal colours than by other colours. In fact, it turned out that the children did pick out focal chips more frequently than non-focal chips. The preponderance of the focal chips was particularly strong for the colours yellow, orange and green, where 22, 21 and 11 respectively out of the total of 24 children selected the focal chip from the array. For the other five hues, the numbers were smaller, but still statistically significant.
The second experiment which Rosch conducted with children was a colour-matching task. The children, this time 4-year-olds, were given focal and non-focal chips one at a time in random order and asked to point to the same colour in an array of colour chips which were identical to those used in the earlier experiment. As predicted by the test hypothesis, focal colour chips were matched more accurately than non-focal chips, and this again supports the perceptual salience of focal colours. In terms of cognitive processes, this second test involves identification and classification; both the test chip and one or several possible target chips have to be identified and classified so that they can be compared. Comparison in turn presupposes that the data collected about the chips are temporarily stored somewhere, and this is where memory comes into play.
Matching situations where both the test item and the target items are simultaneously present are rather the exception. Normally we are confronted

with an item (i.e. a colour which has to be identified and classified) but have to rely fully on data stored in memory for comparison. This raises the question whether focal colours are salient in memory as well, whether they are recognized more accurately, learned more easily and recalled more readily than other colours. Investigating these aspects Rosch used specific memory tests: recognition tasks to test the short-term memory and learning tasks aimed at the long-term memory (Heider 1972).
The recognition task was similar to the matching task discussed above, but demanded more concentration from the informants. As this proved too difficult for children, Rosch used Dani informants who, as already mentioned, have only two basic colour terms. The same test was conducted with a control group of Americans. Both the Dani and the English-speaking informants were shown eight focal and eight non-focal colour cards in random order each for five seconds. Each single presentation was followed by an interval of 30 seconds, after which the subjects were asked to point out the matching colour chip on a colour card of the Berlin and Kay type. For both groups the matching accuracy for focal colours was significantly higher than for non-focal ones. The conclusion one may draw is that focal colours are remembered more accurately in short-term memory than non-focal ones. Another result was that the English-speaking control group surpassed the Dani in matching accuracy both for focal and non-focal colours. This may be due to the fact that the larger set of basic colour terms available to speakers of English facilitates colour recognition.
The second experiment consisted of a learning task testing retention of previously unknown colour names in long-term memory. This experiment exploited the fact that, because of their limitation to two basic colour terms, the Dani could be taught additional ones under controlled conditions. Before the test began, the Dani informants were told that the experimenter would teach them a new language. When learning was completed, they were paid for their help. At the start, the 16 colour cards (again eight focal colours and eight non-focal colours) were laid out in random order and the Dani were told the name for each card. (The names used were the names of Dani clans.) After their first display the cards were gathered into a pack, shuffled and presented one by one to the Dani, who were asked to produce the name of each colour. They were praised for every correct response and told the correct name when they were wrong. This procedure was repeated five times a day until the Dani managed to get all 16 answers right and the learning process was considered completed. A detailed record was kept of the whole learning process, which took three and a half days on average. This record supplied the means of measuring the ease of retention of focal and non-focal

UngeCh01v3.qxd 8/5/06 12:19 AM Page 14

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

colours because it allowed a computation of all the correct and incorrect answers. Whereas, on average, the Dani gave 9.9 incorrect answers per colour for non-focal colours before they produced their first completely correct run, the mean number of errors per colour for focal colours was only 7.3. Even without previous knowledge of the colour names, the Dani associated focal colours more rapidly with their names than non-focal colours.
As well as perception and memory work, naming was mentioned as the third component of categorization. Given the salience of focal colours we would expect the following results: first, names should be produced more rapidly for focal colours than for non-focal ones; second, children should acquire the names of focal colours earlier than the names of non-focal colours. Empirical evidence, again provided by Rosch, suggests that both assumptions are correct.
Let us now review Rosch’s findings:
• Focal colours are perceptually more salient than non-focal colours. The attention of 3-year-olds is more often attracted by focal than by nonfocal colours, and 4-year-olds match focal colours more accurately to a given display of other colours than non-focal colours.
• Focal colours are more accurately remembered in short-term memory and more easily retained in long-term memory.
• The names of focal colours are more rapidly produced in colour-naming tasks and are acquired earlier by children.
All in all, focal colours appear to possess a particular perceptual–cognitive salience, which is probably independent of language and seems to reflect certain physiological aspects of man’s perceptive mechanisms (Kay and McDaniel 1978). These results encouraged Rosch to extend the notion of foci – or prototypes, as she now called them – beyond colour categories, e.g. into the domains of shapes, organisms and objects.
Prototypical shapes
Let us start our discussion of shapes with a little experiment based on the drawings in the top row of Figure 1.2 (set 1). Imagine you were asked to describe what you see in this figure to someone who is not allowed to inspect it. Presumably you would proceed more or less like this: ‘There is a row of little drawings depicting a square and a number of variations of it. The first drawing is a proper square. The second square has a gap in the righthand side. The right-hand side of the third square has an indentation. The fourth square . . . .’

Figure 1.2 Shapes used by Rosch in prototype experiments (Rosch 1973) (Sets 2 and 3 reconstructed from Rosch’s description, letters added)

Such a description would be in full agreement with the notion of ‘good forms’ as proposed by gestalt psychology (a school of psychology discussed in more detail in Section 1.2). These good forms, i.e. squares, circles and equilateral triangles, are assumed to be perceptually salient among geometrical shapes.
Thus it is only natural that in a situation like the one described above people will single out the square as a reference point for characterizing the other drawings. Squares and the other good forms are therefore prime candidates for ‘natural’ prototypes in the domain of geometrical shapes, similar to the focal colours in colour space.
Using the kind of line drawings shown in Figure 1.2, Rosch (1973) sought confirmation for the notion of prototypes in the domain of shapes. Prior to the actual tests, she had to make sure that, as with colours, the Dani had no category names or even conventional paraphrases at their disposal which could bias them towards the supposed prototypes. This was verified in a pilot study, which used the description method demonstrated above: one test subject explaining the line drawings to another subject who was sitting behind a screen and could not see them. Unlike educated Western speakers, the Dani did not talk of squares and variations, but used expressions like ‘It’s a pig’ or ‘It’s a broken fence’ for their description of the drawings.
For the actual experiment, Rosch contrasted set 1 (the set with the prototype) with other sets which were derived from the variations of set 1. Sets 2 and 3 in Figure 1.2 show two of the possible six alternative sets. Set 2 is

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

based on the principle of gapping (gap on the right-hand side). Considering this principle, the prototype which appears as (b) in set 2 is indeed a very extreme case because it represents the absence of the gap. Set 3 is based on the principle of indenture, and again the square is just a marginal member of the set.
As in the earlier colour-learning experiments, the Dani had to learn names which were again borrowed from Dani clans. This means they had to associate sets of drawings with names. The result fully confirmed Rosch’s assumption that the prototype is associated with a name and also judged best example, no matter whether it is presented in a natural category (set 1) or as a marginal realization of the principle underlying one of the other sets.
Combined with the findings from the earlier colour experiments, these results suggest that prototypes have a crucial function in the various stages involved in the formation and learning of categories.
Prototypical organisms and objects
It could still be argued at this point that prototypes ultimately depend on the perceptual nature of the categories examined so far (colours, shapes) and are therefore a very limited if not exceptional phenomenon. The question is whether the notion of prototype can be extended to entities which are less obviously perceptual. Granted there are good and bad examples of reds and squares. Are there also good and bad examples of dogs, cars and houses? According to Rosch and her informants there are. In a series of experiments (Rosch 1973, improved version 1975) she confronted informants, this time American college students, with the following test instructions:
This study has to do with what we have in mind when we use words which refer to categories. Let’s take the word red as an example. Close your eyes and imagine a true red. Now imagine an orangish red . . . imagine a purple red. Although you might still name the orange red or the purple red with the term red, they are not as good examples of red (as clear cases of what red refers to) as the clear ‘true’ red. In short, some reds are redder than others. The same is true for other kinds of categories. Think of dogs. You all have some notion of what a ‘real dog’, a ‘doggy dog’ is. To me a retriever or a German shepherd is a very doggy dog while a Pekinese is a less doggy dog. Notice that this kind of judgment has nothing to do with how well you like the thing. [. . .]
(Rosch 1975: 198)
In the remainder of the instructions the students were asked to judge the goodness (or typicality) of category members, i.e. to decide how good

an example of the category BIRD a sparrow, a parrot, a penguin and about 50 other candidates were. Rating was based on a 7-point scale of goodness (one point for very good, seven points for very poor examples). Altogether ten categories were tested: in addition to BIRD, the categories were FRUIT, VEHICLE, VEGETABLE, SPORT, TOOL, TOY, FURNITURE, WEAPON and CLOTHING.
Admittedly, Rosch’s test instructions show a certain bias towards the notion of prototypicality (‘. . . some reds are redder than others. The same is true for other kinds of categories’). Yet this should not have distorted the test results too much. As Rosch stresses, the rating test was readily accepted by the student informants and there was a high level of agreement among them as to what were good and bad examples of the categories. To give an impression of what the results were like, the best, some intermediate and the poorest examples of five out of the ten categories are assembled in Figure 1.3.

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

The goodness ratings were also confirmed in matching experiments in which the ‘priming’ technique was used (Rosch 1975). In one of these tests, subjects were shown pairs of names or pictures on a screen. The subjects had to press a ‘same’ key when pairs of identical names or pictures of items appeared on a screen (e.g. a word sequence like eagle–eagle or two identical pictures of an eagle); the time between the presentation and the reaction was measured (it was in the range of 500 to 1000 milliseconds). Two seconds before the presentation, subjects were given the category name (in this case BIRD) as advance information, so they were ‘primed’ with the category name. (There was also a control group that performed the test unprimed.) The hypothesis was that advance knowledge of the category name would influence the speed with which the matching task was performed and that it might influence the matching of good and poor examples in different ways. Indeed, priming had a twofold effect which nicely supported the goodness ratings. Primed informants were faster in reacting to identical pairs of items that had been rated as good examples (both words and pictures). Conversely, reaction was slowed down by priming where poor examples were involved. Reaction to pairs of intermediate examples was not noticeably affected by priming. Without getting lost in speculations about the cognitive representations of categories at this point, we can still support Rosch’s claim that the advance information which is called up by the primed category name is most readily applied to good examples; sparrows, oranges or cars (automobiles in American English) simply fit the expectations called up by the names of the categories BIRD, FRUIT and VEHICLE. However, this advance information is not helpful with poor examples. In fact, priming with the category name tends to confuse test subjects when they are confronted with pairs of penguins, olives or wheelbarrows, which can at best be placed at the periphery of the BIRD, the FRUIT or the VEHICLE category.
Good examples, bad examples and category boundaries
As the categorization of colours, shapes, birds and vehicles suggests, category membership is not, as was for a long time assumed by philosophers and linguists, a yes-or-no distinction. Rather it involves different degrees of typicality, as is supported by goodness-of-example ratings, recognition, matching and learning tasks.
Rosch’s main concern was to prove that categories are formed around prototypes, which function as cognitive reference points. As far as the boundaries of categories are concerned, she leaves us with the impression

UngeCh01v3.qxd 8/5/06 12:19 AM Page 19

PROTOTYPES AND CATEGORIES

19

that at some unspecified point or area beyond their periphery the categories somehow fade into nowhere. This is not the idea we have when we talk about categories in a naive way. Normally, we tend to imagine them as boxes, drawers or some sort of fenced compound – certainly as something which has boundaries. With regard to the category BIRD, the allocation of boundaries seems to be easy enough, even though a little knowledge of zoology might be required.
Yet our confidence will be undermined when we follow the philosopher Max Black and consider the imaginary ‘chair museum’ he invented. According to Black it consists of

a series of ‘chairs’ differing in quality by least noticeable amounts. At one

end of a long line, containing perhaps thousands of exhibits, might be a

Chippendale chair: at the other, a small nondescript lump of wood. Any

‘normal’ observer inspecting the series finds extreme difficulty in ‘drawing the

line’ between chair and non-chair.

(Black 1949: 32)

What Black’s interpretation of his chair museum suggests is that the collection of chairs could and should be regarded as a continuum with a kind of transition zone between chairs and non-chairs but no clear-cut boundaries. This view seems to be in conflict with what we observed at the beginning of the chapter: that concrete objects like houses, books and also chairs are clearly delimited and easy to identify, and that vague boundaries and transition zones are restricted to items like knees, fog and valleys and to scales like length, temperature and colour.
Here one must be careful not to confuse two different types of boundaries and transition zones. One type of transition zone arises from the observation that some concrete entities do not have clear-cut boundaries in reality – this is the case with knee and other body parts; it applies to fog, snow and similar weather phenomena and to landscape forms like valley or mountain. In Black’s chair museum, however, the visitor is confronted with a different type of transition zone, since each exhibit in the museum is an entity with absolutely clear boundaries. In the chair museum, it is not entities that merge into each other, but categories of entities, and these categories are the product of cognitive classification. Consequently, it is not the boundaries of entities that are vague, but the boundaries of these cognitive categories (here: chairs and non-chairs). To distinguish the two types of vagueness we will restrict the terms ‘vague entity’ and ‘vagueness’ to the first type (knee, fog, valley) and use ‘fuzzy category boundaries’ or fuzziness for the second, i.e. for the category boundaries of CHAIR etc.

UngeCh01v3.qxd 8/5/06 12:19 AM Page 20

20

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

The issue is, however, even more complicated because there are in fact cases where vagueness and fuzziness coincide. This is true of the second type of entities, as already observed by the philosopher Willard Quine, who found that the category MOUNTAIN is

vague on the score of how much terrain to reckon into each of the indisputable

mountains, and it is vague on the score of what lesser eminences to count as

mountains at all.

(Quine 1960: 126)

In other words, entities like mountains are vague because they are not clearly delimited as individual entities; the cognitive category MOUNTAIN (or KNEE or FOG) is fuzzy because it does not have clear boundaries either.
Summing up, we can say that our deeper understanding of the cognitive background of categorization has considerably changed our original idea about the threefold classification of entities into clearly delimited organisms and objects, into entities with vague boundaries and into scales – a view which is based on a kind of ‘naive realism’.6 From a cognitive perspective these distinctions and the discussion of vagueness arising from them are of minor importance. What is important is that all types of concrete entities and natural phenomena like colours are conceptually organized in terms of prototype categories, whose boundaries do not seem to be clear-cut, but fuzzy.
How can the fuzzy nature of category boundaries, which intuitively seems to be a convincing notion, be investigated empirically? This was the task which William Labov set himself in a series of experiments involving cups and cup-like containers (Labov 1973, 1978).7 Starting from Black’s interpretation of the chair museum, Labov drew the following conclusion:

The subjective aspect of vagueness [i.e. fuzziness in our terminology] may be

thought of as the lack of certainty as to whether the term does or does not

denote; and this may be transformed into the consistency with which a given

sample of speakers does in fact apply the term.

(Labov 1973: 353)

If all informants in a test call an object chair, the consistency is 100 per cent. If half the informants have doubts whether a certain object is still a chair and therefore do not call it chair, the consistency value will drop to 50 per cent. If hardly any of the informants regard an object as a chair and refuse to call it a chair, the consistency value will approach zero. The actual test procedure of Labov’s experiments was very simple: informants were shown line drawings of cups and other vessels, as collected in Figure 1.4. The drawings were presented one by one and the informants were asked to name them (additional descriptive details supplied by the informants were neglected in the analysis).

two handles were also used in the tests)

The results of the naming task were analyzed in terms of consistency and presented as ‘consistency profiles’. Figure 1.5 presents the consistency profile for the vessels shown in the top row of Figure 1.4. As the graph for the use of cup indicates, consistency is 100 per cent for vessel no. 1 but decreases as we proceed towards vessel no. 5. In addition, Figure 1.5 also contains the complementary graph for the use of bowl. This graph demonstrates that Black’s chair museum was rather unrealistic in that he only compared ‘chairs’ with ‘non-chairs’. In contrast, Labov’s test shows that in experimental and everyday categorizing situations, we normally do not just make a division between the two categories ‘X’ and ‘not X’, but that we have two or several names at our disposal which allow us to choose between neighbouring categories, in this case between CUP, BOWL, MUG and VASE, etc. Therefore, it is more realistic to think of fuzzy category boundaries as fringe areas between adjacent categories than as transitions to a conceptual vacuum. Figure 1.5 shows that as the consistency value for cup drops dramatically for vessels 4 and 5, the use of bowl slowly begins to pick up. It is for these fringe

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

areas between the two categories that the term ‘fuzzy boundaries’ seems to be particularly appropriate. Labov’s tests can therefore be taken as a first experimental proof of the fuzziness of category boundaries.
However, this fuzziness assumes a new dimension when one considers the full range of Labov’s experiments. In the first test (the one discussed so far) the informants were only confronted with the drawings, but not given any background information (this was called ‘neutral context’ by Labov). In the subsequent three tests they were asked to imagine one of three different scenes: (a) a coffee-drinking situation, (b) a dinner table situation with the object filled with mashed potatoes (‘food context’) and (c) a scene where the objects were standing on a shelf with cut flowers in them. In later experiments different materials like china and glass were introduced as well.
The result of including these variables was a massive shift of category boundaries. To give just one example, in a food context, vessel no. 3 was no longer a cup for the majority of the informants. As indicated in Figure 1.6, half the informants called it bowl in spite of its unchanged shape, and this switch towards bowl was even more pronounced for vessel no. 4. In this way Labov’s experiments show that the fuzziness of category boundaries has many facets, of which context-dependence is one of the most important. (This issue will be taken up in Section 1.3; another aspect of Labov’s tests, his carefully controlled use of scalar properties like width, depth and shape, will be discussed in the next section.)
Let us now relate Labov’s findings to what has already emerged about the nature of cognitive categories in the preceding sections:
• Categories do not represent arbitrary divisions of the phenomena of the world, but should be seen as based on the cognitive capacities of the human mind.

PROTOTYPES AND CATEGORIES

• Cognitive categories of colours, shapes, but also of organisms and concrete objects, are anchored in conceptually salient prototypes, which play a crucial part in the formation of categories.
• The boundaries of cognitive categories are fuzzy, i.e. neighbouring categories are not separated by rigid boundaries, but merge into each other.
• Between prototypes and boundaries, cognitive categories contain members which can be rated on a typicality scale ranging from good to bad examples.
If we accept that cognitive categories consist of prototype, good examples and bad examples, and have fuzzy boundaries, this suggests that the internal structure of categories is indeed rather complex and that it deserves a more detailed examination.
To conclude this section a word of caution is in order. Cognitive categories, as we have discussed them, are stored in our mind as mental concepts and signalled by the words of a language, so one might come to think that they are equivalent with the meanings of these words. Yet if we consider that colour terms do not just denote colours, but can also stand for political parties, that bird does not only refer to a creature with wings but, at least occasionally, also to a pretty girl, that chair can denote the president of a meeting and that cups and bowls can be trophies in sport, it is clear that there is no one-to-one relation between categories (or concepts) and words. In fact it is quite normal that one word denotes several categories, or in conventional linguistic terminology, that words are polysemous.8 As the later chapters will show (especially Chapters 3 and 4), cognitive linguistics is not only concerned with the exploration of individual categories, but also has something to say about the relationship between the categories which are signalled by one and the same word.
Exercises
1. List basic colour terms in English (or your native language) by checking which colour terms consist of only one short word and are freely applicable to different kinds of objects and organisms. Describe the colour of sweaters, T-shirts, etc., using basic colour terms as points of reference.
2. Select typical examples of the categories T-SHIRT, LONG-SLEEVE (T-SHIRT), SWEATER and JUMPER. Can you think of items of clothing which illustrate the fuzziness of the boundaries between these neighbouring categories?

3. Draw pictures of prototypical examples and of objects on the borderline between the categories BOTTLE, GLASS, VASE and BOWL, and use them as stimuli for a naming task with your friends or family.
4. As we have found, the vagueness of objects and the fuzziness of categories must be kept apart. Look at the following examples and discuss which of them involve fuzziness or vagueness or both aspects: mountain, hill, summit, plateau, valley; tree, shrub, flower; hedge, bush, forest, park; street, road, avenue, drive, highway; river, stream, brook, torrent, firth, estuary, spring.
5. The names of category prototypes tend to come to mind before those of peripheral examples. Check this hypothesis with two informal tests: ask one group of friends to name as quickly as they can five types of dogs, birds, trees and cars. List the items mentioned by the informants, add other suitable items and present this extended list to a second group for a goodness-of-example rating. Compare the results and discuss reasons for discrepancies between the two tests.

1.2 The internal structure of categories: prototypes, attributes, family resemblances and gestalt
If cognitive categories are made up of prototypes and periphery, of good and bad examples, how do these differ and how are they related to each other? The listing and the analysis of attributes seem to provide a good approach to these aspects of internal category structure, while the notion of family resemblances is helpful as a theoretical explanation. A fascinating though less well explored factor in categorization is the ‘gestalt’ of organisms and concrete objects, which will also come up for discussion.

Cognitive categories are, as we have just seen, labelled by words, and words are listed in dictionaries. It is therefore only natural to look for information about the contents of categories in dictionary entries. Here are some examples of dictionary definitions for types of birds:

robin

A small brown European bird with a red breast. (OALD)

PROTOTYPES AND CATEGORIES

parrot ostrich

A tropical bird with a curved beak and brightly coloured feathers that can be taught to copy human speech. (LDOCE4)
An ostrich is a large African bird that cannot fly. It has long legs, a long neck, a small head and large soft feathers. (COBUILD)

In terms of categorization, these dictionary definitions yield two types of information. To start with, they supply the name of the category to which the robin, the parrot and the ostrich belong (in this case BIRD). This category name in turn suggests the properties which are shared by most birds: that they have feathers, two legs, two wings and a beak, and that they lay eggs. The main body of the dictionary entries lists properties which are specific to the item in question. Thus the robin is characterized by small size, brownish colour and red breast-feathers. These properties clearly set the robin apart from other members of the category BIRD, such as parrots and ostriches. So robins, parrots and ostriches have properties which serve to tie them to a common category as well as properties which distinguish them from each other. Collecting both the shared and the distinctive properties seems to provide a feasible way of describing the internal structure of categories.
However, there are some problems. Dictionary definitions are written for a practical purpose and not with a systematic linguistic and cognitive analysis in mind. Lexicographers can afford to skip some properties that are to be taken for granted, or they can modify their definitions by limiting expressions or ‘hedges’, like usually (parrots ‘usually’ have brightly coloured feathers). A more systematic linguistic approach not only has to fill in gaps, e.g. by adding to the definition of robin that it chirps and to the definition of ostrich that it can run very fast. A linguistic analysis will also have to clarify the notion of property or attribute (to use the more technical term).
Regarding the attributes used in dictionary entries, it may be quite sufficient to understand them in the rather vague sense of ‘characteristics’ or ‘typical aspects’. From a more theoretical stance, an additional question must be asked: are attributes to be regarded as obligatory or not? This distinction was first suggested by Aristotle, who contrasted the ‘essence’ of things with the ‘accidence’. The notion of essence gave rise to what has been called the ‘categorical view’ or ‘classical view’, a position which was vigorously defended by structuralist and transformationalist linguists.9 According to this view, a category is defined by a limited set of necessary and sufficient conditions. These conditions are conceived as clear-cut, ‘discrete’ features (or essential features, as they will be called here), which

UngeCh01v3.qxd 8/5/06 12:19 AM Page 26

26

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

can be either present or absent. In the case of the category BIRD, this means that a creature is only a bird if it has two wings and two legs, a beak, feathers and lays eggs (these are the necessary conditions). If, on the other hand, a creature has all these essential features, this is also sufficient for classifying it as a bird.
Such a rigid view of attributes and categorization is bound to run into difficulties when it is applied to cognitive categories consisting of good and bad examples and equipped with fuzzy boundaries, as introduced in Section 1.1. To cope with these experiential prototype categories we need a much more differentiated notion of attributes than is supplied by the classical view. The following discussion of attributes for birds will exemplify the problems.

Attributes, good birds and bad birds: an example

Our starting point is a list of attributes collected for >ROBIN<, which was rated best example of the category BIRD in Rosch (1975; see Figure 1.3). The idea is that this list is the closest approximation available of the ‘prototypical’ attribute list for BIRD and that it would be very suitable for comparisons with lesser category members:

1. ‘lays eggs’ 3. ‘has a beak’ 5. ‘can fly’ 7. ‘is small and lightweight’ 9. ‘chirps/sings’

2. ‘has two wings and two legs’ 4. ‘has feathers’ 6. ‘has thin, short legs’ 8. ‘has a short tail’ 10. ‘has a red breast’

The list is based on dictionary definitions of robin and bird, but is also supported by attributes collected from informants (Hampton 1979). More precisely, it assembles what dictionary makers and ordinary people (the informants) find worth mentioning about robins. Such a list will never be complete (for example, our description does not mention what kind of food a robin eats) and the items will tend to overlap (in our case this applies to nos 2 and 6, which both refer to the bird’s legs, and to nos 4 and 10, which are both concerned with the bird’s plumage). Yet while these deficiencies may be confusing to the linguist raised in the classical tradition, they still seem, for the time being, to provide the best empirical way of describing the properties that can be used in categorizing a robin.
When trying to apply the attributes collected for robins to other examples of the category BIRD which scored high in Rosch’s rating test, e.g. >SPARROW<,

UngeCh01v3.qxd 8/5/06 12:19 AM Page 27

PROTOTYPES AND CATEGORIES

27

>CANARY< and >DOVE<, one will find that, with the exception of the red breast, sparrows and canaries share all the attributes assembled for robins. Doves do not chirp or sing and surpass the other three types of birds in size and weight; otherwise they share the attributes listed. It seems, therefore, that at least the attributes ‘lays eggs’, ‘has a beak’, ‘chirps/sings’, all the attributes concerning wings, feathers and the ability to fly, and, finally, the ‘thin, short legs’ and the ‘short tail’ are somehow related to a central position within the category BIRD.
Now take a less good example of a bird, say >PARROT<. Going through our list again, you will find that a parrot resembles a robin in that it lays eggs, has a beak, two wings, two legs and feathers and can fly. However, compared to a robin a parrot has rather strong legs, most parrots are much larger than robins and have quite long tails. And a parrot certainly does not chirp or sing.
Finally, when considering the attributes of >OSTRICH< (which was, of course, rated a poor example of the category BIRD), the result will be that the only attributes an ostrich shares with our short list are that it lays eggs, has two legs and feathers, and that it has some kind of beak.
All in all, there seems to be a bundle of attributes that represent important aspects of ‘birdiness’. These attributes tend to correlate in nature, i.e. they appear together. A creature that has wings and feathers is more likely to be able to fly than one that has fur and four legs. Types of birds qualifying for these attributes have a particularly prominent position in the category. Intermediate and bad examples of the category BIRD differ from these prototypical examples in two ways: either they deviate to a moderate degree with regard to one or more attributes (think of the parrot’s legs and tail) or some attributes are missing altogether (e.g. ostriches cannot fly).
This distribution is illustrated in matrix form in Figure 1.7, where a plus sign stands for an attribute which is present, a minus sign for a missing attribute, and a plus/minus combination for a greater or lesser deviation from the expected form of the attribute. The matrix thus reflects the fact that a yes/no representation of attributes (which would correspond to the classical view) cannot adequately render the attributes of birds and has to be modified to include intermediate judgements.
Though this may not be obvious at first glance, ‘deviant’ and ‘missing’ attributes can be seen as different problems and have been addressed in different ways in cognitive research. Since the absence of attributes (as in the case of >OSTRICH<) seems to be the more serious problem, it will be tackled first, while the deviant attributes (as observed with >PARROT<) will be taken up later.

Figure 1.7 Goodness-of-example and distribution of attributes in the category BIRD

The principle of family resemblances
The paradox in the case of the ostrich is that we are quite prepared to call it a bird though it shares only few attributes with prototypical birds like the robin. Yet as the above dictionary definition suggests, there is no lack of attributes to describe >OSTRICH<, and while some of these attributes (‘is very tall’, ‘runs very fast’) seem incompatible with our idea of a bird, some are less so. Take the attribute ‘long neck’ and you will find that this applies to birds as far apart from ostriches as are flamingoes and storks (though not to robins). Or take the attribute ‘large soft feathers’ and it may remind you of swans, while the alternative version offered by other dictionaries for this attribute, i.e. ‘decorative feathers’, suggests links with peacocks and perhaps even with parrots (though not with sparrows).
However, in other categories the items are even more dissimilar, as the philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein showed in his much-quoted passage about the category GAME:
Consider for example the proceedings that we call ‘games’. I mean board-games, card-games, ball-games, Olympic games, and so on. What is common to them all? – Don’t say: ‘There must be something common, or they would not be called “games” ’ – but look and see whether there is anything common to all. – For if you look at them you will not see something that is common to all, but similarities, relationships, and a whole series of them at that. To repeat: don’t think, but look! – For example at board-games, with their multifarious relationships. Now pass to card-games; here you find many correspondences with the first group, but many common features drop out, and

UngeCh01v3.qxd 8/5/06 12:19 AM Page 29

PROTOTYPES AND CATEGORIES

29

others appear. When we pass next to ball-games, much that is common is retained, but much is lost. – Are they all ‘amusing’? Compare chess with noughts and crosses. Or is there always winning and losing, or competition between players? Think of patience. In ball-games there is winning and losing; but when a child throws his ball at the wall and catches it again, this feature has disappeared. Look at the parts played by skill and luck; and at the difference between skill in chess and skill in tennis. Think now of games like ring-a-ringa-roses; here is the element of amusement, but how many other characteristic features have disappeared! And we can go through the many, many other groups of games in the same way; we see how similarities crop up and disappear.
(Wittgenstein 1958: 66f)
Wittgenstein’s conclusion was that games are connected by a network of overlapping similarities, which he called family resemblances. On a somewhat more abstract level, the principle of family resemblances has been defined as a set of items displaying the following kind of distribution:

Item 1 2 3 4

Attributes AB BC CD DE

Overlapping similarities AB
BC CD DE

In the words of Rosch and Mervis (1975: 575), ‘each item has at least one, and probably several, elements in common with one or more other items, but no, or few, elements are common to all items’.
Wittgenstein’s explanation and the definition supplied by Rosch and Mervis both pursue the same aim: to show that the principle of family resemblances opens up an alternative to the classical view that attributes must be common to all category members, that they must be ‘category-wide’. This could be most impressively demonstrated with the analysis of ‘superordinate categories’ like GAME (Wittgenstein’s example) and FURNITURE, VEHICLE, FRUIT, etc., which were investigated by Rosch and Mervis (1975). As will be shown later in Section 2.2, it is not surprising that superordinate categories largely depend on family resemblances.
The picture changes when one considers categories like BIRD or other more concrete categories like CAR, TRUCK, AIRPLANE, CHAIR, TABLE and LAMP. As observed in the case of BIRD, even very bad examples of the category like >OSTRICH< (and we might add >PENGUIN<) have some important attributes in common with all the other category members. And, of course, the good examples such

Figure 1.8 Selected common attributes and family resemblances of the category BIRD

as >ROBIN< and >SPARROW< all share whole bundles of attributes, so that only a few of their attributes rely on the family resemblance principle. This situation is illustrated in Figure 1.8, where attributes are indicated by lines.
Just as with birds, members of categories like CAR and CHAIR (i.e. different types of cars and chairs) share many more attributes than the members of the superordinate categories VEHICLE and FURNITURE (i.e. different types of vehicles and different items of furniture). Here Section 2.1 will provide an explanation.
Yet however much the significance of family resemblances may vary for individual categories, this does not affect the explanatory potential of the underlying principle. What is decisive is that family resemblances can explain why attributes contribute to the internal structure of the category even if they are not common to all category members, i.e. if they are not essential features according to the classical view. An ostrich is a bird not only because it has feathers and lays eggs, like a robin (indicated by bold

lines in Figure 1.8); category membership is also supported by the fact that the ostrich has a long neck like a flamingo, and decorative feathers like a peacock (see thin lines in Figure 1.8). In defining the position of a category member in its category, we are thus justified in considering any sensible attribute proposed for this item. This is the theoretical background of the attribute-listing experiments carried out by Rosch and her associates and the typicality ratings that were based on them.
Attribute listing and attribute-based typicality ratings
Given the ease with which we seem to be able to call up the attributes for familiar objects and organisms, attributes can be collected in a fairly simple test procedure that can be easily administered to a large number of subjects. In the attribute-listing experiments conducted by Rosch and Mervis (1975), each of the subjects (400 American psychology students) was given six sheets of paper with the test item written on the top of the page. The subjects had a minute and a half to write down all the attributes that they could think of. To eliminate answers that were obviously false or wrongly attributed to an item or too general in meaning, the attribute lists were checked by two judges.
The test items used were selected from the lists obtained in the goodnessof-example ratings described in Figure 1.3 and consisted of sets of 20 graded category members, one set for each of the categories FURNITURE, VEHICLE, FRUIT, WEAPON, VEGETABLE and CLOTHING. Altogether, 120 items from >CHAIR< to >TELEPHONE< (for FURNITURE), >CAR< to >ELEVATOR< (for VEHICLE) and from >ORANGE< to >OLIVE< (for FRUIT) were tested.
The experiment had two aims: to demonstrate the notion of family resemblance (see above) and, more important for Rosch and Mervis, to supply attribute-based typicality ratings (this neutral term seems preferable to Rosch and Mervis’s own term ‘measure of family resemblance’). These typicality ratings could then be used to verify the earlier goodness-of-example ratings.
How were the attribute-based ratings calculated? Leaving aside mathematical details, two stages can be distinguished. First, the attributes were ‘weighted’, that is, it was established for how many of the 20 tested category members each attribute had been listed. The top score of 20 was given if an attribute was shared by all category members (‘means of transport’ in the case of vehicles). An attribute listed for only one category member (think of ‘installed in buildings’, which would only fit >LIFT< or >ELEVATOR<) received the score 1; attributes applying to several but not all category members were assigned intermediate scores. The result was a list of weighted attributes.

UngeCh01v3.qxd 8/5/06 12:19 AM Page 32

32

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

In the second stage the weights of all the attributes listed for each category member were added up and rank-ordered (the actual procedure was somewhat more complex).10 Category members with many shared and therefore highly weighted attributes, such as >ORANGE< or >APPLE< in the FRUIT category, achieved high overall ratings; category members like >OLIVE<, which shared only few, if any, attributes with other category members, scored low. When this attribute-based rank order was compared with the goodness-of-example ratings, the two types of ratings showed a high degree of correlation.
This correlation could be used to support the notion of prototype categories in two ways. On the one hand, the hypothesis that these categories consist of good and bad members was no longer solely dependent on the intuitive judgements of the goodness-of-example ratings, but could now be related to a large range of attributes. On the other hand, the notion of good and bad examples could be used to explain why attributes are so unevenly distributed among category members. While good examples have many attributes in common with other members of the same category, bad or marginal examples share only few attributes with members of the same category.
Yet as we know from the dictionary entries discussed at the beginning of this section, the intra-categorial links of attributes represent only one side of the coin. Equally important is the question of distinctive attributes, i.e. whether the members of a category, both good and bad examples, share attributes with members of neighbouring categories. This was tested in a further attribute-listing experiment in which good and bad examples of the category CAR were contrasted with members of the categories TRUCK, BUS and MOTORCYCLE. As it turned out, the overlap of attributes is smallest between the good examples of the different categories, but is much larger in the case of bad or marginal examples. In other words, a prototypical car, say a saloon, has fewer attributes in common with a prototypical truck than an estate car does; the saloon also shares fewer attributes with a prototypical motorcycle than a three-wheeler does.
Looking now at both sides of the coin we can summarize the attribute structure of prototype categories as follows:
• Prototypical members of cognitive categories have the largest number of attributes in common with other members of the category and the smallest number of attributes which also occur with members of neighbouring categories. This means that in terms of attributes, prototypical members are maximally distinct from the prototypical members of other categories.

UngeCh01v3.qxd 8/5/06 12:19 AM Page 33

PROTOTYPES AND CATEGORIES

33

• Bad examples (or marginal category members) share only a small number of attributes with other members of their category, but have several attributes which belong to other categories as well, which is, of course, just another way of saying that category boundaries are fuzzy.
Attributes and dimensions
Returning to the matrix of bird attributes in Figure 1.7, it is clear that Rosch and Mervis have indeed solved the problem of ‘missing’ attributes as observed with >OSTRICH< and other bad examples of the BIRD category. This still leaves the ‘deviant’ cases, that is category members whose attributes do not comply with the expected norm. Most of these ‘deviant cases’ involve attributes related to dimensions, such as ‘size’ and ‘weight’, ‘length (of tail)’ and ‘thickness (of legs)’. This takes us back to Labov’s cups and bowls, which were already discussed in the context of fuzzy category boundaries in Section 1.1. In choosing cups and cup-like containers for his experiments Labov could rely on ‘width’, ‘height/depth’ and ‘shape’, i.e. on generally accepted ‘logical’ properties of the dimension type, and did not have to expose himself to the vagaries of empirical attribute listing. In this respect he is more in line with traditional linguists than Rosch and Mervis are. The dimensions had the advantage that they could be varied under controlled conditions, and these variations could be easily and unequivocally represented in line drawings. This was illustrated in Figure 1.4, which is here repeated for convenience as Figure 1.9.
In this figure the variation of the dimensions is based on the ‘prototypical’ cup no. 1. In the top row the height (or depth) of the vessels is kept constant while the width is extended systematically from vessel to vessel. Conversely, in the second row the width of vessels is identical, but from left to right the vessels become deeper and deeper. Other scalar variations used by Labov (and not illustrated in Figure 1.9) concerned the shape of the vessels and involved cylinders, truncated cones, etc. In addition, he used

34

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

attributes like ‘context’ or ‘function’ (‘neutral/coffee/food/flower context’), ‘material’ (glass, china) and ‘presence/absence of handle(s)’, all of them ‘nonscalar’ attributes at first sight.
To bring these diverse attributes in line with dimensions, Labov defined the specific width/height ratios of his test vessels as discrete values on the width and height dimensions. In the same way the attributes involving context, material and handles were interpreted as values on a dimension: the neutral, coffee, food and flower contexts as values on the ‘context’ dimension; glass and china as values on the ‘material’ dimension; presence and absence of handles as two values on the ‘handle’ dimension.
How did these attribute values show up in the actual test results, i.e. the use of cup or bowl or mug for certain vessels? According to Labov, the use of these words reflected the ‘weighted’ acceptability judgements of test subjects. These judgements were weighted in the sense that the different values of the attributes involved led the subjects to choose different names for the test vessels. If the ‘prototypical’ cup (vessel no. 1) was called cup by all test subjects, this judgement could be related to the fact that vessel no. 1 represented the favourite width/height ratio in a neutral context. Vessel no. 2 was still overwhelmingly called cup because it represented a very similar width/height ratio. In contrast, vessel no. 4 was assessed as a borderline case of cup because its width/height ratio differed markedly from the favoured value. If the use of cup was extended by the test subjects in a coffee context and reduced in a food context, this was due to the interaction of the width/height ratio with the respective values on the ‘context’ dimension.
While such three-variable constellations could still be documented in consistency profiles (as shown in Figure 1.5 and 1.6), the more complex interactions could only be mastered by mathematical formulas and probability calculation which are beyond the scope of this introduction (see reading note 7).
Nevertheless, the aims and the methods employed by Labov should have become clear. Starting out from attributes which could, at least theoretically, be regarded as values on dimensions, he overcomes the limitations implicit in the discrete attributes of the logical view, and this is where he seems to go further than Rosch and Mervis. The scalar values are then related to each other in a weighting process, and here his method comes closest to Rosch and Mervis’s procedure.
Internal category structure and gestalt
When comparing attribute-based typicality ratings with the goodness-ofexample ratings (i.e. direct typicality ratings), we suggested that the latter are

UngeCh01v3.qxd 8/5/06 12:19 AM Page 35

PROTOTYPES AND CATEGORIES

35

based on intuition. The question is, however, what this intuition might be derived from. Does it perhaps rely on some internal attribute-based rating? From a ‘naive’ point of view, this seems unlikely. When we encounter an animal we will hardly begin categorizing by evaluating specific attributes, unless we are struck by a very salient one like the stripes of a zebra or the trunk of an elephant. With most organisms and concrete objects, especially those that are familiar to us, we seem to proceed in a different way. We simply take in an overall picture of the whole and use it for a first assessment of its goodness. The consideration of specific attributes can then be left until later.
The problem with this quite plausible conception is that it seems impossible to investigate it in controlled test situations or, to put it more pointedly, to exclude experimentally that people categorize and evaluate the goodness of items on an attribute-by-attribute basis. To return once more to Labov’s naming tests, it does indeed make sense to assume that informants’ judgements are based on the overall impression of a cup or bowl rather than on an internal computation of the width/height ratio, material and context, but this alternative cannot be ruled out. For the time being, we have to be content with results of more informal test interviews.
A series of such interviews was conducted in the context of the categorization of houses (Schmid 1993: 121ff). The starting point was Labov’s method of eliciting category names for the drawings of objects, which was applied to the buildings shown in Figure 1.10. The aim of the interview

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

part of the test was to collect information about how the categorization process was carried out and how it was experienced by the informants.
After a first glance at the drawings (which were presented one by one with other pictures interspersed) the informants named the buildings. At this stage, pictures (a) and (b) were quite readily categorized as cottages, while picture (c) was assigned to adjacent categories which were labelled house in the country or villa. Just as with Labov’s cups and bowls there was no total agreement among the informants. While 10 of the 12 informants did not call picture (c) cottage, two were prepared to do so. When asked to give the reasons for their categorizing decision, the informants explained they had judged on the basis of a general impression of the drawings. This can be taken as an indication that an internal goodness-of-example scale was already established on the basis of the first overall impression. Only on second thoughts were the informants able to pinpoint certain individual properties that might have led them to select the name they did. The choice of cottage seems to have been influenced by the material (‘made of stone’) and the simple but sturdy construction in the case of picture (a), and by the thatched roof for picture (b). The deviant width/height relation (‘too big’) and the numerous extensions of building (c) may have helped to rule out cottage as an appropriate name for the majority of the informants.
As far as these interviews go, they support the initial assumption that categorization and goodness ratings may indeed involve two stages: the perception of an object as a whole as the first step (the so-called holistic perception), and a kind of decomposition of the perceived whole into individual properties or attributes as a second (optional) step.11
The idea of ‘perceived whole’ comes close to the notion of gestalt as advocated by gestalt psychologists,12 so it may be helpful to look at some of their findings. Their major claim is that gestalt perception can be traced back to ‘gestalt laws of perceptual organization’, or ‘gestalt principles’, which are usually demonstrated with line drawings and dot patterns. The most important of these principles are:
• ‘principle of proximity’: individual elements with a small distance between them will be perceived as being somehow related to each other;
• ‘principle of similarity’: individual elements that are similar tend to be perceived as one common segment;
• ‘principle of closure’: perceptual organization tends to be anchored in closed figures;
• ‘principle of continuation’: elements will be perceived as wholes if they only have few interruptions.

PROTOTYPES AND CATEGORIES

37

The more a configuration of individual elements adheres to these principles, the more it will tend towards a clear-cut and cogent organization (called Prägnanz by the gestalt psychologists), which lends itself to gestalt perception. Examples which show a high degree of Prägnanz are called ‘good gestalts’ or ‘good forms’. Among them are circle, square and equilateral triangle, which we already encountered in our discussion of shapes in Section 1.1, where they appeared as prototypes of shape categories.
However, shape is just one aspect of the gestalt of organisms and objects, although such an important one that it is sometimes, inaccurately, treated as equivalent with gestalt. The question is whether the gestalt principles are not only valid for dot patterns and geometrical shapes, but can also be applied to the much more complex configurations of organisms and objects.
As it seems, a central role in providing an object with a gestalt is played by its constituent parts.13 Consider once more the cottages (a) and (b) in Figure 1.10. It is obvious that they consist of walls, windows, a door, a roof and a chimney. Yet when we look at these drawings for the first time, the cottages are not visually ‘deconstructed’ into these parts, but are perceived as an integral whole. This holistic visual perception is possible because the parts are organized according to the gestalt principles of proximity (all the parts are close together), of similarity (identical windows), of closure (all the parts are included in one overall outline) and continuation (all the lines are uninterrupted).
Similarly, if you look at some everyday object that is in your view at the moment, maybe a chair, a table or a bookshelf, you will realize that the salient parts make an important contribution to the whole without at first being noticed as individual parts. Other perceptual aspects such as the overall proportions, the material and the colour of objects interact with the overall shape and the parts to complete the holistic impression of a gestalt.
Having established that objects are perceived as integral wholes, we can go on to ask ourselves what makes one gestalt more prototypical for a category than another. Here one enters new ground, because apart from the good forms among geometrical shapes, this question was not really the concern of gestalt psychology. We would like to argue that it is again the parts of an object that play an important role in establishing a prototypical gestalt. Parts do not only contribute to the overall shape of an object, but are also related to its function, which for most artefacts is the raison d’être of the object. Likewise, the existence of most parts of an object is motivated by the particular purpose the object serves.
Consider a chair, for example. The functionally relevant parts of a chair are the legs, the seat and the back. Our assumption now is that the prototypical

Figure 1.11 A prototypical chair gestalt and other chairs
gestalt of a chair relies predominantly on the presence of these three functional parts in optimally functional proportions. Looking at the drawings of chairs shown in Figure 1.11, the prototypical chair gestalt is best represented by picture (a).
An analogous explanation can be attempted for the gestalts of organisms such as birds if we understand the ‘function’ of a bird to mean the enactment of a certain form of organic life. This prototypical mode of life would be characterized by the ability to live on trees and shrubs, to fly, and to pick nuts, seeds, worms, etc., for food. Assuming a functional design of the parts, we would expect from a prototype gestalt that parts like the beak, the legs, and especially the wings, have the appropriate form: the legs should have claws which allow the bird to cling to branches, the beak should be protruding and sharp to facilitate food picking, wings should be shaped aerodynamically. Even more important, the parts would have to have the right proportions (large wings in comparison to the remaining part of the body etc.). This may read like a replica of the attributes listed in the matrix at the beginning of this section (see Figure 1.7). The decisive difference is that these functionally balanced parts are all integrated into one gestalt, and are perceived as a whole.
All this might suggest that for concrete objects as well as for organisms the prototype gestalt should be conceived as a kind of reduction to the relevant and mainly visual essentials, though perceived as a whole. Such a notion is supported by the experience of how easy it is to grasp and categorize reduced illustrations, as have been increasingly used in dictionaries over the

last few years.14 (The case of pictograms, as used in traffic signs, is more complex because here the drawings are used as a vehicle for instructions and will therefore be neglected.)
We would hold the position that the effectiveness of reduced drawings is not a general phenomenon even with concrete objects and organisms, but depends on the kind of lexical category to be illustrated. Just look at the drawings of a bungalow and a cottage in Figure 1.12, which are both taken from the same dictionary (LDOCE2, 1987). The bungalow is reduced to the functional parts (one-storey building with walls, roof, windows, door), and can still be readily identified. In contrast, the illustration of the cottage contains a wealth of detail, and this seems to be necessary for easy recognition, so it is in fact more easily categorized than some of the plainer drawings of cottages in Figure 1.10.
From this it can be deduced that the prototype gestalt of a cottage comprises more than the complete and well-proportioned parts of a house, important as all this may be. The function of a cottage includes notions like creating warmth and cosiness and being embedded in natural rural surroundings. In other words, all sorts of emotional and attitudinal properties are involved. Similarly it is difficult to imagine a line drawing of an English pub (and, incidentally, none of the major dictionaries provides one); the wealth of gestalt properties applying to a pub is simply too great.
Or take another simple case, the teddy bear. To approximate the prototype gestalt of a teddy bear it is certainly not enough to give the outline drawing of a teddy that coincides with its natural model, the brown bear. What is also needed is an indication of its softness (something that takes us beyond the visual to the tactile properties of the gestalt), and, perhaps most important, the teddy should be hugged by a child to round off the general impression of its function.
This shows that even in the domain of concrete objects we are not just confronted with a single kind of gestalt prototype (the ‘reduced type’) but

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

have to take into account that certain lexical categories require richer visual representations, which in turn suggest richer underlying gestalt prototypes. The situation becomes even more complex when we consider that for many lexical categories – those loosely called ‘abstract’ categories – gestalt perception is largely excluded.
Summing up at this point, our discussion of gestalt has shown mainly two things:
• Gestalt perception seems indeed to play an important part in categorization and goodness ratings. For the categories discussed it seems to be as essential as the possibility of studying attributes and family resemblances and computing attribute-based typicality ratings.
• The role of gestalt in the categorization of objects and organisms need not be completely left to intuition; it can be studied by making selective use of the principles of gestalt psychology and by considering additional aspects like parts and function.
Any research into gestalt properties, and even the preliminary sketch attempted here, is intimately bound up with questions of mental representation and processing, just as the notions of good and bad examples, of attributes, and of prototypicality in general cannot be isolated from their cognitive background. So it seems appropriate to conclude this section with a few more general remarks about the cognitive status of categories and of the notions involved in categorization.
The cognitive status of categories, prototypes, attributes and gestalt
For the linguist, categorization is an important issue because it underlies the use of words and the use of language in general. Since producing and understanding language undoubtedly involve cognitive processes, categorization is necessarily something that takes place in our minds, and the categories resulting from it can be understood as mental concepts stored in our mind. Taken together they make up what has been called the ‘mental lexicon’.15 Unfortunately, we do not have direct access to cognitive phenomena, so everything that is said about the categories of the mental lexicon can only have the status of a more or less well-founded hypothesis. Such a hypothesis can be supported by philosophical argument, by physiological research into the human sensory apparatus and by experimental evidence based on linguistic and other human behaviour.
To avoid misunderstandings, two things should be kept in mind. First, the number of hypotheses about cognitive categorization is theoretically

UngeCh01v3.qxd 8/5/06 12:19 AM Page 41

PROTOTYPES AND CATEGORIES

41

unlimited; it is definitely not restricted to the two paradigms which will be discussed in this section. Second, the postulated category paradigms need not apply indiscriminately to the whole domain of human categorization, but may be restricted to certain areas and perspectives.
Let us start with the ‘classical’ model of categorization, a hypothesis with a very long tradition. This hypothesis claims that categories come as homogeneous units with clear-cut borderlines and that all members are characterized by a limited number of essential features (a set of necessary and sufficient conditions, as discussed above). This beautifully simple model is often accompanied by the philosophical speculation that this type of category mirrors, or is even predetermined by, the constitution of the organisms and objects in the ‘real’ world. The problem is that this hypothesis is not in accordance with the evidence collected by physiologists and psychologists.
In contrast with the classical model, the experiential prototype hypothesis of categorization claims that categories are not homogeneous, but have a prototype, good and bad members, and have fuzzy boundaries. Category members do not all share the same discrete attributes, but may be linked by family resemblances. In the case of colours and shapes, prototype theory is supported by both physiological and psychological evidence. As suggested in Section 1.1, colour categories and focal colours seem to be based on the nature of the human perceptual apparatus. Their prototype structure was also confirmed by psychological tests. In the case of organisms and concrete objects only this second type of evidence is available. As this short survey of the classical and the prototype paradigms has shown, it does indeed help to take the strictly cognitive view, the view that categorization is something that underlies the mental processes of language comprehension and language production. This view provides us with a vantage point from which we can now delve deeper and examine the main elements of the prototype hypothesis: the notions of prototype, category membership and typicality, attributes, family resemblances and gestalt.
Prototype
Basically, there are two ways to understand the notion of prototype. It can be deduced from categorization experiments. For instance, some members of a category first come to mind in association experiments and are recognized more rapidly as category members in verification tasks. If one takes these members as prototypes of the respective categories, this leads to definitions like ‘best example of a category’, ‘salient examples’, ‘clearest cases of category membership’, ‘most representative of things included in a class’ or ‘central and typical members’ (see Rosch 1978; Lakoff 1986; Brown 1990; Tversky 1990).

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

But this is not the conception of prototype that we would advocate. Instead we would claim that if one takes the cognitive view of categories seriously, one is justified in defining the prototype as a mental representation, as some sort of cognitive reference point. Thinking of prototypes in this genuinely cognitive way still leaves open the nature of the mental representation, so that definitions may range from the more concrete notion of ‘image’ or ‘schema’ to the more abstract ‘representation of a category’ or ‘ideal’ according to the categories to which they are applied (definitions from Rosch and Mervis 1975; Coleman and Kay 1981; Lakoff 1986).
Category membership and typicality
Unlike the homogeneous categories postulated by the classical hypothesis, cognitive prototype categories always consist of good and bad members and include marginal examples whose category membership is doubtful.16 This not only applies to attested cases of prototype categories, such as colour categories or CUP, BOWL, MUG and CHAIR, but also to categories like BIRD, where category membership seems to be safely based on discrete attributes such as ‘laying eggs’. But do ordinary language users have the encyclopaedic knowledge to decide whether a penguin lays eggs or not? If they do not, the issue whether the penguin is a bird will remain undecided, and >PENGUIN< will be a doubtful member of the prototype category BIRD.
Even for prime cases of apparently discrete homogeneous categories, such as ODD NUMBER, SQUARE and kinship categories (MOTHER, UNCLE, etc.), a prototype structure cannot be completely excluded. As experiments have shown (Armstrong et al. 1983; Fehr and Russell 1984), informants do in fact distinguish between good and bad examples of odd numbers and squares, and similar reactions can be assumed for MOTHER (Lakoff 1987) and other kinship terms.
However, this only applies to ‘everyday’ categorization. In a mathematical or scientific context the classical view comes into its own. In such a context ODD NUMBER, SQUARE, kinship categories and even BIRD can be established as clear-cut and homogeneous categories by an act of definition. In other words, the classical paradigm of categorization has a wide field of application wherever there is a need for precise and rigid definitions as in the domain of scientific categorization or in the legal field. And there is no reason why the discrete categories of science and the everyday prototype categories should not coexist in the mental lexicon and even influence each other.
Attributes and family resemblances
Attributes as collected from informants by Rosch and others are statements which provide information about the members of a category. In this sense attributes are part and parcel of the empirical investigation of category structures.

UngeCh01v3.qxd 8/5/06 12:19 AM Page 43

PROTOTYPES AND CATEGORIES

43

When the attribute lists for individual category members are compared, this is assumed to reflect the similarity relations between category members. Such similarity relations may encompass all category members (‘category-wide attributes’) or they may establish links only between some of the members. In the latter case, category coherence is produced by family resemblances.
Since similarity relations between good and bad members of a category are part of the hypothesis of prototype structure, this implies that they are also part of the mental representation of a category. This is not necessarily so for the empirically collected attributes which are elicited from informants and which may be fragmentary and overlapping. So attributes are best considered as a descriptive tool and not as part of the mental representation of the category. Such a cautious position is even more advisable when attributes are treated as values on dimensions. For such dimensions as ‘size’, ‘width’ and ‘shape’ may be imposed on the attributes by the logically minded researcher and are not necessarily a reflection of our natural way of thinking about the objects in the world around us.
Gestalt
As originally conceived by gestalt psychologists, the notion of gestalt was intended as an explanation of holistic perception. We have suggested a link between gestalt and the notion of prototype categories. If a gestalt is organized according to the gestalt principles and includes the functional parts of an item in functionally balanced proportions, it may be regarded as a ‘prototype gestalt’. This ties in with the definition of prototype as an ‘image’, which was quoted above. In fact, in the case of organisms and concrete objects where visual perception seems to be important, the prototype gestalt contributes considerably to the ability of the prototype to function as a model or cognitive reference point.
This is where we think we should leave the psychological issues of categorization, moving on in the following section to look at some sociological, or, more broadly, cultural factors that influence the formation of prototypes and prototype categories.
Exercises
1. Collect attributes for the following categories and try to distinguish between objective properties and subjective associations: MAN, WOMAN, BOY, GIRL; MANSION, PALACE, COTTAGE, CASTLE;

BICYCLE, MOTORBIKE, CAR, VAN, LORRY; JEANS, LEGGINGS, TUXEDO, TAILCOAT, MINISKIRT. 2. Look at the picture of the ‘Smith brothers’ devised by Armstrong et al. (1983: 269).

In what way is the principle of family resemblances illustrated by this drawing? Which attributes are shared by all the brothers?
3. Have a look at how Wierzbicka (1985: 19–36) explains the difference between CUP and MUG and discuss whether you find her arguments plausible. Wierzbicka claims that the difference in meaning boils down to the difference in the intended use of the respective objects; apply this idea to the categories VASE, BOWL and PLATE.
4. Discuss the attributes ‘fun’, ‘no purpose other than the game itself’, ‘uncertain outcome’ and ‘governed by rules’ as candidates for the status of category-wide attributes for the category GAME. Try to come up with other possibilities and discuss possible counterexamples.
5. Pictograms are more than simple line drawings. Look at some traffic signs and some of the signs in railway stations, bus terminals or airports and explain whether they make use of gestalt perception. What additional information do they convey?
6. Ask a friend or two to draw simple pictures of a car, a bus, a telephone, a book, a bottle, a tree, a house and a church. Discuss to what extent the principles of gestalt psychology can be applied to their drawings. Does the perspective or vantage point from which the objects are viewed play a role?
7. Discuss the difference between the classical view of categorization and the prototype model with reference to legal categories like MURDER, MANSLAUGHTER; VANDALISM, LOOTING; ASSAULT, ASSAULT AND BATTERY; NEGLIGENCE, GROSS NEGLIGENCE. What are the problems a judge faces when he has to deal with unclear cases?

8. In the context of the acquisition of the meaning of words Aitchison (2003: 193) writes about a child’s use of the word qua (‘quack’) as discussed by the Russian psychologist Vygotsky:
The child began with qua as a duck on a pond. Then the liquid element caught the youngster’s attention and the word was generalized to a cup of milk. But the duck had not been forgotten, and this surfaced in qua used to refer to a coin with an eagle on it. But then the child appeared to ignore the bird-like portion of the meaning and focus only on the roundness of the coin, so reapplied the word qua to a teddy-bear’s eye.
Discuss how the strange assembly collected by the child in the category QUA can be explained with the principle of family resemblances.
1.3 Context-dependence and cultural models
The prototypes of cognitive categories are not fixed, but may change when a particular context is introduced, and the same is true for category boundaries. More generally, the whole internal structure of a category seems to depend on the context and, in a wider sense, on our social and cultural knowledge, which is thought to be organized in cognitive and cultural models.
Reading the sentence He opened the door to face a pretty young woman with a dog in her arms, what kind of dog would first spring to your mind? Would it be an Alsatian or a collie, which would presumably turn out to be prototypical dogs in a goodness-of-example rating? Or would you not rather think of a Pekinese or some other kind of small lapdog? The chances are that you would. Though this may look like a rather trivial example, it has far-reaching implications for the theory of prototypes. What it suggests is that prototypes are not after all the fixed reference points for cognitive categories that we have assumed them to be, but that they are liable to keep shifting as the context changes.
The context-dependence of prototypes and of the whole internal category structure
Let us first expand the lapdog example and, by way of a little experiment, compare it to other examples involving references to dogs. Read the following four sentences one by one, pausing for a second after each example to check what kind of dog is suggested to you:
1. The hunter took his gun, left the lodge and called his dog. 2. Right from the start of the race the dogs began chasing the rabbit.

UngeCh01v3.qxd 8/5/06 12:19 AM Page 46

46

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

3. She took her dog to the salon to have its curls reset.
4. The policemen lined up with the dogs to face the rioters.
We can safely assume that for each of the four sentences you will have formed a different image of the kind of dog that is denoted. In a hunting context like example (1), the most likely dog would probably be some kind of retriever; in the dog racing context of example (2), it would certainly be a greyhound that would first come to mind. In examples (3) and (4), you will presumably have imagined a poodle and an Alsatian respectively. These examples suggest that what turns out the most likely member of a certain category depends on the context. Since we may expect the prototype to be our first choice, the result of our little experiment indicates that, depending on the context, the prototype shifts. The ‘context-dependent’ categories thus evoked may be completely different from the non-contextualized prototypes elicited in goodness-of-example experiments.
However, more than a shift of prototypes is at stake in these examples. Let us assume that in a goodness-of-example test >ALSATIAN< would be rated as a prototypical dog, with >GREYHOUND<, >SETTER< and >POODLE< being just slightly less prototypical. >PEKINESE< would presumably be a rather peripheral dog because of its small size, flat face and somewhat ‘undoggy’ behaviour. Taking this category structure as a starting point, it seems clear that the sentences above do more than just shift the prototype. In some cases the category structure of the context-dependent category is much leaner than that of the non-contextualized category. For example in sentences (2) and (3) the context-dependent prototypes are >GREYHOUND< and >POODLE< respectively; virtually all other types of dogs are so unlikely that, for all practical purposes, they are highly peripheral members of the context-dependent category.
In contrast, in sentence (1) the internal category structure of DOG is retained to a larger extent. One could certainly imagine an Alsatian or a setter being used as a hunting dog. Nevertheless they are clearly less typical members of the context-dependent category (HUNTING) DOG than retrievers. Thus the principle of different degrees of goodness-of-example is still valid in this case, and the same is true for examples (3) and (4). The main point, however, is that the context-dependent category structure is different from the structure that was obtained in non-contextualized goodness-of-example ratings. Altogether, it seems that the context not only determines the choice of the category prototype, but that it also leads to an adjustment of the position of other category members. How can this be explained?17
One way is to use attributes as an explanatory tool. As shown in Section 1.2, weighted attributes can be employed to explain the typicality structure

UngeCh01v3.qxd 8/5/06 12:19 AM Page 47

PROTOTYPES AND CATEGORIES

47

of a category. When viewed in terms of attributes, context seems to have a twofold effect: first, the context can change the weight of attributes that seem to be relevant for a certain category. Attributes of the category DOG that seem to be decisive in the goodness-of-example ratings and attribute-based typicality ratings (e.g. ‘barks’, ‘has four legs’, ‘wags tail when happy’, ‘likes to chase cats’, etc.) apparently lose weight in specific contexts; second, the context can emphasize attributes that are not prominent and even introduce new attributes which would not be mentioned at all in non-contextualized attribute-listing experiments. In the hunting-dog context, attributes like ‘brings back the kill’ or ‘points out the position of animals for shooting’ increase in importance. In the dog-racing context, ‘has long, thin legs’, ‘can run fast’, ‘is enduring’ and others become crucial. With the introduction of new attributes and the re-evaluation of the weights of existing ones the attribute list for a member of a category changes completely. The result is that previously peripheral examples are equipped with large bundles of heavily weighted attributes and turned into good examples or even prototypes, while well-established good examples are reduced to the status of marginal members.
Context, situation and cognitive models
Once we have acknowledged that the context can completely reshuffle the positions of members within the category structure, we must ask ourselves what the context is. How can we grasp this rather elusive notion, which is nevertheless one of the most widely used terms in linguistics?
‘Context’ has been defined in many ways by scholars with different backgrounds and various aims in mind. From a purely linguistic point of view the context has been regarded as the linguistic material preceding and following a word or sentence. Language philosophers and pragmalinguists, most notably Searle (1979: 125), have defined context as the set of background assumptions that are necessary for an utterance to be intelligible. In discourse-oriented approaches to language the context has been related to the situation in which an utterance is embedded. Originating in the work of the anthropologist Malinowski, the term ‘context’ has been extended still further to include the so-called ‘context of culture’. Malinowski had argued as early as 1923 that both the ‘context of situation’ and the ‘context of culture’ were necessary for a proper understanding of an utterance or text (Halliday and Hasan 1989: 5ff).
For cognitive linguists it is important that the notion of ‘context’ should be considered a mental phenomenon. This requirement is stressed

UngeCh01v3.qxd 8/5/06 12:19 AM Page 48

48

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

by Langacker, for example, who defines his central notion of domain ‘as a context for the characterization of a semantic unit’ (1987a: 147).18 This very general interpretation of ‘context’ will be discussed in Chapter 4 alongside other basic tenets of Langacker’s theory. In this section we will try to present a more tangible, but still cognitive, view of the notion of ‘context’.
To do this it will be helpful to distinguish ‘context’ from ‘situation’ and a few other related terms. Figure 1.13 illustrates our suggestion for a meaningful terminological distinction between the notions ‘context’ and ‘situation’ with reference to the example sentence The boy was building a sandcastle with his bucket and his spade. The figure shows that we will treat the ‘context’ as belonging to the field of mental phenomena, while the ‘situation’ refers to some state of affairs in the ‘real world’. (The quotation marks around real world are necessary in view of the age-old debate among philosophers as to whether there is such a thing as a ‘real world’ at all; see reading note 6).
As Figure 1.13 indicates, we define the term situation as the interaction between objects in the real world. In the exemplary situation described by the sentence above, the situation is made up by four objects, namely a boy, a sandcastle, a bucket and a spade, which interact through the activities of the boy. When the sentence is being processed by the hearer or reader, the words call up the corresponding cognitive categories, or to put it more simply, the mental concept we have of the objects in the real world. In addition, a cognitive representation of the interaction between the concepts

is formed, and it is for this cognitive representation that the term context will be used. In Figure 1.13, we have characterized the context for the example sentence roughly as ‘building a sandcastle’. It should be emphasized that in contrast to most pragmatic and/or sociolinguistic approaches to context, our notion does not focus on the speech event in which an utterance is made, but on the cognitive representation of the situation depicted by the utterance.19
Of course, this cognitive representation, or context, does not remain an isolated mental experience, but is immediately associated in at least two ways with related knowledge stored in long-term memory. On the one hand, context-specific knowledge about the categories involved is retrieved.20 This leads to the selection of >PLASTIC BUCKET< as the most typical member of the context-dependent category BUCKET and of >CHILDREN’S SPADE< as the most typical member of the context-dependent category SPADE.
On the other hand, the currently active context calls up other contexts from long-term memory that are somehow related to it. In our example, experiences about other aspects of sand and sandcastles, besides those expressed in the sentence above, might be evoked. Related categories like WATER, HANDS, SHELLS, TURRET or MOAT, and frequent interactions between all these categories like ‘digging sand’ or ‘shaping turrets’ are good candidates for such associated contexts.
It stands to reason that for all kinds of phenomena that we come across in everyday life, we have experienced and stored a large number of interrelated contexts. Cognitive categories are not just dependent on the immediate context in which they are embedded, but also on this whole bundle of contexts that are associated with it. Therefore, it seems quite useful to have a term which covers all the stored cognitive representations that belong to a certain field. We will use the term cognitive model for these knowledge bases; other related terms like ‘frame’ or ‘script’ will be taken up again in Chapter 5.21
Figure 1.14 shows one of the two cognitive models (ON THE BEACH and IN THE SANDPIT) in which the context ‘building a sandcastle’ could possibly be embedded. When we consider this example, two important properties of cognitive models become immediately apparent. First, as indicated by the reference to ‘other contexts’ in Figure 1.14, cognitive models are basically open-ended. A practical consequence of this property is that it is very hard to describe the cognitive model of a domain and that descriptions of cognitive models are never exhaustive, but always highly selective.
Second, just like the contexts that build the basis for cognitive models, cognitive models themselves are not isolated cognitive entities, but interrelated.

Figure 1.14 Schematic illustration of the cognitive model ON THE BEACH (the major categories and the way they interact are indicated in brackets)

In our example, it can be seen that the categories PEOPLE, SEA, SAND and others keep occurring in various contexts that make up the model ON THE BEACH. Consequently, the cognitive models of PEOPLE, SEA and SAND are closely related to the model ON THE BEACH. In line with theories of the mind which emphasize its so-called ‘connectionist’ architecture, one can argue that cognitive models combine to build networks.22 This tendency can probably best be explained using a visual representation. Figure 1.15 gives an idea of a network which consists of various cognitive models that are interrelated through multiple connections.
So far, two aspects of cognitive models have emerged from the exemplary representations that we have provided: their incompleteness and their tendency to build networks. There is a third, although not so obvious, property of cognitive models that should not be neglected, namely the

fact that cognitive models are omnipresent. In every act of categorization we are more or less consciously referring to one or several cognitive models that we have stored. Only in the very rare case when we encounter a totally unfamiliar object or situation will no appropriate cognitive model be available, but even then we will presumably try to call up similar experiences and immediately form a cognitive model. Imagine the case of a foreign visitor to Britain who goes to watch a cricket game for the first time in his life. Having no cognitive model of the situation at his disposal he will have no idea what is going on on the field. Nevertheless the visitor will try to relate what he sees to similar cognitive models perhaps about games in general or about his knowledge of baseball.
Clearly, then, we can neither avoid the influence of cognitive models nor function without them. Even in the rather artificial situation of goodnessof-example ratings, the cognitive model of the field that the subjects are being asked to rate is at work. Therefore, it would be misleading to say that such experiments take place in an uncontextualized vacuum. What these experimental situations generate is a very neutral or zero-context which can be compared to sentences like When she looked out of the window she saw a . . . or She thought of the . . . . Uncontextualized language in the sense of ‘language without cognitive models’ is apparently unthinkable.
Cultural models
Cognitive models, as the term suggests, represent a cognitive, basically psychological, view of the stored knowledge about a certain field. Since psychological states are always private and individual experiences, descriptions of such cognitive models necessarily involve a considerable degree of idealization. In other words, descriptions of cognitive models are based on the assumption that many people have roughly the same basic knowledge about things like sandcastles and beaches.
However, as the cricket example has shown, this is only part of the story. Cognitive models are of course not universal, but depend on the culture in which a person grows up and lives. The culture provides the background for all the situations that we have to experience in order to be able to form a cognitive model. A Russian or German may not have formed a cognitive model of cricket simply because it is not part of the culture of his own country to play that game. So, cognitive models for particular domains ultimately depend on so-called cultural models. In reverse, cultural models can be seen as cognitive models that are shared by people belonging to a social group or subgroup.

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

Essentially, cognitive models and cultural models are thus just two sides of the same coin. While the term ‘cognitive model’ stresses the psychological nature of these cognitive entities and allows for inter-individual differences, the term ‘cultural model’ emphasizes the uniting aspect of its being collectively shared by many people. Although ‘cognitive models’ are related to cognitive linguistics and psycholinguistics while ‘cultural models’ belong to sociolinguistics and anthropological linguistics, researchers in all of these fields should be, and usually are, aware of both dimensions of their object of study.
Our earlier reference to Malinowski’s ‘context of culture’ has already shown that to include cultural aspects in linguistic considerations is not really a recent invention. Yet although the cultural background has long been part and parcel of investigations in sociolinguistics and anthropological linguistics, only few semanticists have bothered to deal with such matters.23 In the following we will discuss three examples of categories where cultural models are highly relevant for a proper understanding of cognitive categories and their structure.
The English and French prototypes of the category FIRST MEAL OF THE DAY can serve as first illustrations. The prototypical attributes of the meal in the two countries are listed in Figure 1.16. The two lists in Figure 1.16 show how different the French and the English prototype of the category are. While the French >PETIT DÉJEUNER< is a rather frugal affair consisting of a large bowl of coffee and a croissant, the >ENGLISH BREAKFAST< includes a whole array of things to eat and drink. Since the French breakfast needs much less crockery, cutlery and atmosphere, French hotels often do not provide a breakfast room, but serve breakfast on a tray in the bedroom or ask you to have your coffee and croissant in a nearby café or bar. In contrast, the English breakfast is never served in the bedroom, but in a breakfast room. The reasons why the two types of breakfast are so different, and this is our point here,

>PETIT DÉJEUNER< Components: coffee croissant
served at bedside or local café or bar not included in room rate

>ENGLISH BREAKFAST< Components: cereal and milk tea or coffee, orange juice toast, butter, marmalade bacon, eggs, baked beans, sausages, tomatoes served in breakfast room
included in room rate

is that they reflect different cultural models concerning the function and relevance of the meals of the day. According to the French MEALS OF THE DAY model, breakfast is of minor importance because the midday meal is supposed to be rather solid and will be followed by another substantial evening meal. In contrast, the English cultural model is based on a substantial first and last meal, while the midday meal or lunch is a rather slender affair.
What this example also illustrates is that cultural models are not static but changing. In fact, what we have described as the English prototype may still be practised in hotels and bed and breakfast places, but can no longer be regarded as standard routine in families. Conversely, many continental hotels which used to serve a ‘Continental breakfast’ modelled on the French prototype (though normally replacing croissants by something else) are now offering ‘buffet breakfasts’, which have many of the attributes of an English breakfast.
The differences between cultural models and their effects on the structure of a category become more obvious when cultures of countries as far apart as Europe and Japan or China are compared. Consider the objects depicted in Figure 1.17. The desks illustrated in (a) and (b) represent traditional European desks at which people used to work either standing or seated on a chair. In contrast, in China and Japan writing was traditionally performed sitting cross-legged or on one’s heels on the floor. Within

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

this traditional cultural model of writing, object (c) in Figure 1.17 is prototypical while objects (a) and (b) would have been rather peripheral members of the desk category. Yet this cultural model is also changing under the influence of modern communication; computer and telecommunication equipment are erasing the traditional Japanese and Chinese cultural writing model in favour of ‘international’ business standards for categories like DESK.
Our last example is perhaps more intriguing because it documents that different cultural models must be assumed even where the same language and the same words are used. This is quite common in languages that are spoken in many parts of the world such as English. Employing Rosch’s methods of goodness-of-example ratings (see Sections 1.1 and 1.2), Schmid and Kopatsch (forthcoming) show that the conceptual structures underlying everyday words in the English spoken by students in Northern Nigeria differed significantly from those elicited at two universities in the USA. English is an official language in Nigeria, which is spoken as a second or third language by all people with tertiary education. One of the categories investigated was FOOD. The experiment was based on interviews with 75 Nigerian students at the University of Maiduguri, Northern Nigeria, and 74 students from two American universities in Santa Barbara, California and Lexington, Massachusetts. The informants were asked to give typicality ratings based on a list of 48 food items which included not only meat, bread, beans or pizza and chips, but also items such as millet, yam (a tuber similar to potatoes), cassava (a flour made from a tropical plant) and colanut (seeds of the cola tree containing caffeine which play an important cultural role in celebrations). A selection of the results is presented in Figure 1.18.
Although some correspondences can be observed – cf. e.g. the similar ratings for chicken and meat – each of the two lists is characteristic of the disparate cognitive models of FOOD prevalent in the respective culture. The prototypical items heading the lists read like plans for the week’s dishes, with chicken, fish, bread, pizza, salad and meat featuring most prominently on the American table, and beans, rice, yam, chicken, meat and cassava on the Nigerian. Common Western items like apple, orange and sausage with good rankings by the American students have their places much lower down in the Nigerian list, while Nigerian staple food, especially basic foodstuff like millet, maize – admittedly not a very common term in American English – and wheat are trailing behind in the American list and illustrate the differences between the disparate living conditions in the USA and Nigeria.
In sum, these examples indicate that the cognitive models shared by the members of a culture are similar and distinct from the cognitive models

stored in the minds of people from other cultures. They also show that cultural models have an enormous influence on the conceptual structures of categories. This is not only true when one compares distant cultures like the (traditional) Japanese or Chinese cultures and European cultures, it also applies to the relationship between native varieties of English (like American English) and New Englishes (like Nigerian English). In fact even different native varieties of English are affected: an internet-based attribute-listing test fully endorsed the assumption that the category BUS elicits attributes like ‘yellow’, ‘school’ and ‘kids/children’ in the US, while in Britain the attributes ‘red’, ‘public transport’ and ‘work’ are more prominent and yield a different conceptualization of BUS.†

Naive models and expert models
As they are based on our everyday experiences of the phenomena around us, cultural models may include assumptions that, from a strictly scientific point of view, may be questionable or even inaccurate. For example, it is part of our cultural model of ‘dogs’ that wagging their tails means ‘I am happy’
† We are indebted for these results to Elisabeth Friedrich, Bayreuth.

UngeCh01v3.qxd 8/5/06 12:19 AM Page 56

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

and growling means ‘I am angry’. When cats are purring they are said to be enjoying themselves. For an ethologist or biologist, all these beliefs are highly dubious, because it is by no means clear that animals have emotions at all in the sense that humans do. In their expert models which are based on hard scientific facts and the rules of logic, these types of assumptions would have no place. Naive cultural models, on the other hand, are based on informal observations, traditional beliefs, and even superstitions, and have therefore also been called ‘folk models’.
For obvious reasons, the discrepancy between the scientifically founded models of experts and the naive models of laypersons is particularly noticeable in scientific and technical domains. Consider for example the case of the naive model of the physical phenomenon of motion. McCloskey (1983) carried out experiments and interviews to elicit the cultural model of motion prevalent in America. He asked his informants to imagine an airplane flying at constant speed and altitude. In addition, the informants should assume that at one point during the journey a large metal ball is dropped from the plane, which continues flying at the same speed and altitude and in the same direction. The task was to draw the path the ball will follow until it hits the ground, ignoring wind and air resistance. Its final position in relation to the plane should also be indicated. Before you read on, you should perhaps try to solve the task yourself, i.e. make your own drawing of the paths followed by the plane and the metal ball.
Now compare your drawing with the scientifically correct answer to the problem. As physicists tell us, the ball will fall in a kind of parabolic arc and hit the ground directly below the point the plane has reached in the meantime. The ball will take this kind of path because it will continue to travel horizontally at the same speed as the plane while acquiring constantly increasing vertical velocity.
If your drawing does not agree with the scientific explanation, you are in good company, with 60 per cent of the informants, because no more than 40 per cent of McCloskey’s informants gave the scientifically correct response. The majority of the subjects thought that the ball would take a different course (for instance that it would drop in a straight line or would fall in a diagonal), revealing a ‘naive’ cultural model of motion that differs from the expert model current in physics.
What this experiment shows is that the cultural models held by the majority of the people need not be, and often are not, in line with the objectively verifiable, scientific knowledge available to experts. If we consider that cultural models are based on the collective experience of a society or social group
†
this does not come as a surprise. To get through everyday life, laypersons

do not need scientifically correct models, but functionally effective ones. This means that as long as a model is in line with what we perceive and enables us to make functionally correct predictions, it can have widespread currency although it may be technically inaccurate.
Another illuminating example is provided by Kempton (1987). When she studied the American cultural model of home heat controls or thermostats by means of interviews and behavioural records, she found two competing theories.
One, the feedback theory, holds that the thermostat senses temperature and turns the furnace on and off to maintain an even temperature. The other, which I call the valve theory, holds that the thermostat controls the amount of heat. That is, like a gas burner or a water valve, a higher setting causes a higher rate of flow.
(Kempton 1987: 224)
The feedback theory is technically correct, while the valve theory is wrong. What is of special interest about the two theories is that even though the valve theory is wrong, it also enables us to make the right predictions for the control of temperature in a house and therefore there is no reason why laypersons should not espouse it.
It seems, then, that many naive cultural models, especially in the scientific and technological domain, are inaccurate from a scientific point of view, but usually correct as far as their functional predictions are concerned. In other domains of everyday life the question of the accuracy of a model does not seem to be as relevant. For example, for the cultural models of SANDCASTLE, BEACH, DESKS and BREAKFAST which have been singled out in this section for illustrative purposes, it would not be appropriate to speak of correct or inaccurate models, although experts with particularly refined cognitive models could certainly be found for all spheres. What counts is that ‘ordinary’ everyday experiences do not follow the doctrines laid down for scientific research and the rules of formal logic, but have other, more genuinely cognitive, principles behind them, some of which will be discussed below in Chapters 3 and 4.
To conclude this section, here is a summary of the main issues that have been addressed:
• Cognitive categories interact with and influence each other and this can cause a shift of category prototypes, of boundaries and of the whole category structure.
• Over and above the actual context in which the use of categories is embedded, the internal structure of categories depends on cognitive and cultural models which are always present when language is processed.

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

• A number of terminological distinctions seem necessary for a differentiated view of the context-dependence of categories. Thus we have defined
– situation as the interaction of objects in the real world; – context as the cognitive representation of the interaction
between cognitive categories (or concepts); – cognitive model as the sum of the experienced and stored con-
texts for a certain field by an individual; – cultural model as a view of cognitive models highlighting the
fact that they are intersubjectively shared by the members of a society or social group.
• ‘Naive’ cultural models, especially those for technical domains, need not be in line with the scientifically accurate knowledge of experts, but may be based on what is communal experience, and strictly speaking even ‘wrong’ assumptions. Nevertheless these naive cultural models can be shared by most laypersons in a society as long as the functional predictions they make are correct.
Exercises
1. In pragmatics and sociolinguistics the participants of a speech event are often seen as part of the wider ‘situational context’. Discuss this notion of ‘context’ in relation to the one put forward in this chapter.
2. Object categories like CAR are characterized by attributes relating to their form, size, material, parts, functions, and the associations and emotions they call up. Discuss which of these attributes are more likely to change their ‘weight’ when the context changes, let us say from ordinary traffic to a car race context.
3. Repeat the two-stage test in exercise 5 of Section 1.1 with special contexts like The estate agent climbed out of his . . . (Jaguar, Rolls-Royce, BMW, Mercedes, etc.) or The children loved to climb the . . . (apple tree, pear tree, cherry tree, etc.) in the orchard given before the association and the goodness-of-example rating task.
4. Eskimos have many words for different types of snow, Aborigines for different types of sand, and in Arabic one must choose from a whole range of words which are subsumed under the Western category CAMEL (cf. Lyons 1981: 67). Can you explain these phenomena with the help of the notion of ‘cultural model’?
5. Compare the cultural model BACHELOR with that of its apparent counterpart SPINSTER. Discuss the parallel examples GENTLEMAN–LADY, MASTER–MISTRESS and BOY–GIRL.

6. When Nigerian and US-American students were asked to list attributes for TOMATO, the survey yielded the following results (Schmid and Kopatsch, forthcoming): Nigerian informants: ‘used for making stew/soup’ 61%; ‘red (when ripe)’ 54%; ‘planted/grows on farm/in garden’ 50%; ‘round’ 29%; ‘leaves’ 29%; ‘fruit’ 25%; ‘root’ 18%, ‘kind of vegetable’ 18%. American informants: ‘red’ 88%; ‘fruit’ 72%; ‘vegetable’ 60%, ‘salad’ 55%; ‘green (when not ripe)’ 49%; ‘seeds’ 49%; ‘sauce’ 45%; ‘juicy’ 45%; ‘round’ 45%; ‘pasta/spaghetti’ 28%; ‘pizza’ 19%, ‘soup’ 17%; ‘plant’ 17%; ‘sandwiches’ 15%; ‘sliced’ 15%. What conclusions would you draw from these results with regard to the prevailing cultural models?
7. Ask your friends and family how they imagine the various processes are carried out by the components of a personal computer and extract the naive cultural model from their answers. If you happen to be a specialist in the field, compare the naive model to the expert model.
8. It can be claimed that naive cultural models are regarded as valid as long as they make the right predictions. Look for linguistic examples that reflect either wrong or outdated naive models like the sun rises in the east (of course the earth revolves) or the apple fell to the ground (it is attracted by the force of gravitation). Discuss examples of so-called folk etymologies like sparrow-grass for asparagus, causeway for chausée, cowcumber for cucumber, and the compounds crayfish, starfish and jellyfish.

Kleiber (1998) provides a discussion of the development of prototype theory, though on a fairly abstract level. The shortest description of Rosch’s important contributions to the field is available in Rosch (1978). Rosch (1988) is an informal retrospect of the early stages of prototype theory from her own point of view, which is definitely worth reading. Recent concise accounts of categorization accompanied by critical comments of prototype theory are provided by Cruse (2000: 130–40) and Croft and Cruse (2004: 74–91). Geeraerts (1997) surveys the implications of prototype theory for the explanation of diachronic changes in meaning.

2. Lakoff (1987, ch. 18) discusses Whorf and relativism in some detail. Wider philosophical implications of relativist theories can be found in Putnam (1981: 103–26, esp. 119–24). The continuing interest of cognitive linguists in Whorf’s theories is documented in collections edited by Niemeier and Dirven (2000) and Pütz (2000).
3. The introductory section of Berlin and Kay (1969: 1–5, 14ff; republished several times) certainly makes good reading. A concise survey of various reactions to Berlin and Kay (1969) is provided by Taylor (2003: 9ff). Kay and McDaniel (1978) present neurophysiological data which support part of Berlin and Kay’s claims. See also Kay (1999) on the evolution of basic colour lexicons.
4. Smith and Medin (1981) provide a survey of various theories of categorization. Though not the most recent psycholinguistic textbook, Clark and Clark (1977) is still helpful for the basic psychological and psycholinguistic aspects of categorization. Medin, Ross and Markman (2001, ch. 10) take a critical stance towards prototype theory, which is presented in our chapter. Aitchison (2003) focuses on the storage of categories in the ‘mental lexicon’.
5. Up to 1972, E. Rosch published under her earlier name Heider. So Heider (1971, 1972) and Heider and Oliver (1972) are written by the same author as the publications in the bibliography under the name of Rosch.
6. Lyons (1977: 109ff) is helpful to get a first idea of realism, nominalism and conceptualism, i.e. theories of status of the world. Discussions of the realist–conceptualist model that provides the basis for much thinking in the paradigm of cognitive linguistics can be found in Johnson (1987, ch. 8), Lakoff (1987, ch. 16) and Lakoff and Johnson (1999, chs. 6 and 7). An important source for these chapters is Putnam (1981, esp. ch. 3), which makes some fascinating but not very easy reading.
7. Being the later article, Labov (1978) is more comprehensive; however, the developments mainly concern the mathematical technicalities involved in formalizing fuzziness.

9. For a psychologically oriented account of the classical view of categories see Smith and Medin (1981, ch. 3); for a description from a linguistic and philosophical point of view, Lakoff (1987, ch. 11). Lakoff (1987) also has a chapter (ch. 9) on ‘Defenders of the classical view’, which in fact has the function of defending his own prototypical view of categories. As regards the notion of ‘essential features’, the classic is Katz and Postal (1964, ch. 2). Wierzbicka (1985) considerably extends the notion of essential features and gives interesting, but very detailed, feature definitions for organisms and everyday objects. Lipka (2002: 114–34) gives a concise introduction, which also integrates non-necessary features. See also Croft and Cruse for a short survey (2004: 76–82).
10. For details on the statistical method used see Rosch and Mervis (1975) and Rosch et al. (1976). These articles are also interesting because the statistical notion of ‘cue validity’ is introduced to measure what we call attribute-based ratings. Explanatory remarks are provided in Smith and Medin (1981: 78ff) and Geeraerts (1988a).
11. For a similar view of categorization illustrated with the category UNCLE see Langacker (1987a: 19ff).

15. Aitchison (2003) is a very palatable survey of empirical and theoretical approaches to the mental lexicon, which is predominantly based on linguistic and psycholinguistic work. A critical discussion from a psychological point of view can be found in Smith (1978).
16. Opinions about how to interpret typicality effects have changed with the development of the prototype model. For Rosch’s later position see Rosch (1978) and (1988). For more extensive discussions of the issue see Lakoff (1987: 40ff and ch. 9) and Kleiber (1998). These texts, as well as Croft and Cruse (2004: 79f), include discussions of the distinction between goodness-of-example and degree of category membership, which is irrelevant in our framework, since we rely on cognitive categories based on everyday folk models rather than scientific classifications. Geeraerts argues that prototypicality itself should be regarded as a prototypical notion (1988a) and discusses potential sources of prototypicality (1988b).
Section 1.3
As mentioned in the text, the notion of context has a long research tradition in diverse disciplines. See Schmid (2003) for a very brief survey. Two recent interdisciplinary collections on context are Bouquet et al. (1999) and Akman et al. (2001).

19. The closest approximation to our conception of the terms ‘context’ and ‘situation’ that we know of is van Dijk (1981: 222, 269 passim) who emphasizes the selective or ‘abstractive’ nature of the cognitive context.

CHAPTER 2
Levels of categorization
2.1 Basic level categories of organisms and concrete objects
Scientific classifications may be fascinating in their complexity and rigidity, but are they really suitable for human categorization? So-called folk taxonomies suggest that we approach hierarchies from the centre, that we concentrate on basic level categories such as DOG and CAR and that our hierarchies are anchored in these basic level categories.
Let us return for a minute to the naive view of the world sketched at the beginning of Chapter 1. This view suggests that we are on the whole surrounded by readily identifiable organisms and objects such as dogs, trees, houses and cars. Yet when it comes to categorizing these entities, we normally have a choice between categories on different levels of generality. Thus, we can think of the creature comfortably stretched out on the hearth rug as a ‘dog’, a ‘terrier’, a ‘Scotch terrier’ or, more theoretically, as a ‘mammal’ or an ‘animal’. Obviously all these cognitive categories are connected with each other in a kind of hierarchical relationship. Dogs are regarded as superordinate to terriers, and terriers as superordinate to Scotch terriers and bull terriers; looking in the other direction, dogs are seen as subordinate to mammals, and mammals as subordinate to animals.
The principle underlying this hierarchical structure is the notion of class inclusion, i.e. the view that the superordinate class includes all items on the subordinate level. The class ‘animal’ includes not only mammals, but birds and reptiles as well. On the next level, the class ‘mammal’ comprises not only dogs, but cats, cows, lions, elephants and mice. Still further down, the class ‘dog’ includes terriers, bulldogs, Alsatians, poodles, and various other kinds of dogs. If viewed from below, class inclusion appears as a type-of relationship: a terrier is a type of dog, a dog a type of mammal, a mammal a type of animal. Similar hierarchies exist for man-made objects like

LEVELS OF CATEGORIZATION

65

vehicles, which embrace cars, vans, bicycles, sledges, etc., and their respective subdivisions. All in all, it seems that the whole range of concrete entities in the world can be hierarchically ordered according to the principle of class inclusion. Starting from this notion of hierarchy, the detailed typeof classifications (or taxonomies) which have been developed in many scientific fields may simply appear to be an extension of the basic human faculty of categorization.
Scientific classifications
The prime example of scientific taxonomies is the classification of plants and animals based on the proposals made by the Swedish botanist Linnaeus (Carl von Linné) in the middle of the eighteenth century. Linnaeus’s original conception has been considerably expanded and has grown into a very complex system which today contains 13 major levels of generality (see the list in Figure 2.2).1
More general in scope and closer to our linguistic concerns is the classification proposed by Mark Roget in his still widely used Thesaurus of English Words and Phrases, which was first published in 1852. Roget, a physician with wide-ranging scientific interests and a writer as well, approaches the age-old dream of organizing human knowledge with a claim to scientific rigidity. The knowledge of the world is divided up in six ‘classes’ which are rigorously subcategorized into sections, heads and further subdivisions. Part of his system is illustrated in Figure 2.1, which gives an impression of the monumentality of his conception.2
What these classifications have in common is that, apart from their claim to class inclusion, they do not seem to be tailored to the human mind in at least two respects. First of all, scientific taxonomies simply consist of too many levels. Normally the sole aim of setting up such a taxonomy is to classify all the ‘objects’ on hand, e.g. the two million or so kinds of plants and animals which have been discovered around the world, or the hundred thousands of words of a language. If in the process of classifying it seems necessary to expand the taxonomic grid, new levels and sublevels of classification are introduced no matter how bulky and complex the taxonomy will grow.
In addition to being too complex, scientific classifications do not consider the fact that we are in constant contact and involvement with the organisms and objects of the world around us. As a consequence of this interaction, organisms and objects are evaluated and assume different degrees of importance in our eyes. In contrast with these subjective judgements, scientific classifications

aim to be as objective as possible; they do not favour any one of the items classified or a certain taxonomic level. Another look at Figure 2.1 will show how the automobile is more or less hidden somewhere on the fourth level in the company of pushcart and sled. As for animals, all major kinds are subordinated to ‘animality’, which ranks together with ‘corpse’ and ‘interment’. If any of the levels attract more attention than the others, it is probably the top level and the lowest level because they occupy the salient positions on the borders of the hierarchy.
However, observations about the use and acquisition of cognitive categories and their names seem to indicate that intermediate levels are just as important, if not more so. After all, the cognitive category most naturally selected for the creature on the hearth rug would be DOG rather than SCOTCH TERRIER or ANIMAL, not to mention MAMMAL.

would probably start by saying: ‘two cars crashed into each other’ rather than referring to ‘two vehicles’ or ‘an estate car and a jeep’. This shows that speakers prefer category names like dog and car in neutral contexts or when they introduce new items into the conversation. Category names on a middle level like dog, cat, car or truck are also the ones that are first learned by children; they tend to be the shortest names in hierarchies and they are used most frequently (Brown 1958, 1965). All this lexical evidence appears to invalidate the idea that classification should be objective.
In conclusion, it seems that scientific taxonomies are neither mind-sized nor mind-oriented. The question is what a more subject-related alternative of organizing our knowledge of the world would look like. Such an alternative would have to take account of the mental capacities and limitations of ordinary human beings, and would have to be geared to their experience, their essential needs and interests. Yet so powerful has been the impact of logical taxonomies on modern Western thinking that it is difficult for anyone who has been educated in the Western tradition to imagine such an alternative. This is why, for a fair cognitive evaluation of ‘natural’ hierarchic structures, we must again (as in the case of focal colours and prototypes in Chapter 1) leave the domain of Western culture and study the taxonomies of ‘prescientific’ societies.
Tzeltal plant classification: a case study in folk taxonomies
The most detailed account of a non-scientific taxonomy available is the description of the plant classification of the Tzeltal people, a Mayan-speaking community in southern Mexico, which was provided by Brent Berlin and the botanists Dennis Breedlove and Peter Raven.3 The aim of their research project (Berlin et al. 1974) was to analyze the ‘folk taxonomy’ used by Tzeltal speakers for classifying and naming the plants in their environment, and to discuss how this folk taxonomy is related to scientific Western classifications. Figure 2.2 presents some of their results. Apart from the obvious reduction in taxonomic complexity (of the 13 major levels of the scientific classification a mere five are left in the Tzeltal plant classification), the major insight to be gained from Figure 2.2 is the numerical superiority of what is called the generic level, which attracts no less than 471 categories in all. In contrast, the number of superordinate terms, called ‘life forms’ (level 2), is exceedingly small; it contains no more than four plant names. Of the lower levels, the level of ‘species’ (level 4) is comparatively well represented, though membership is more restricted than on the generic level, while subclassification on the level of variety (level 5) is again negligible.

Figure 2.2 Tzeltal plant classification: selected aspects

The numerical superiority of generic level categories is supported by their linguistic and cultural significance. Cognitive categories on the generic level are not only the most numerous, but also the ones most commonly chosen by Tzeltal speakers even where higher or lower level categories are available, which means that their names first come to mind. Thus a certain type of pine would more likely be called ‘pine’ than either ‘tree’ or ‘red pine’ (in the case of pines this is true for Tzeltal, not necessarily for English, as we will see). In addition, Tzeltal names for generic categories are often short, unanalyzable lexemes, while lower level names typically consist of adjective + generic name, and this is also true of our English translations. Compare pine vs red pine, or the more elaborate example of bean (genus) vs common bean (species) and black common bean (variety). All these findings substantiate to a large degree what was said earlier about the extraordinary status of the middle level in hierarchies in Western culture. Therefore the linguistic evidence both from English and Tzeltal testifies to the special status of the generic or middle level in taxonomies.

Investigating the cultural significance of the generic level in Tzeltal plant classification helps to examine how the taxonomy handles the principle of class inclusion (or type-of relationship), which seems to embody the very essence of the scientific notion of hierarchy. As shown in Figure 2.2, the degree of inclusion of categories in their respective superordinate categories is 100 per cent, with the notable exception of the generic level, where the figure is 75 per cent. This means that three-quarters of the generic Tzeltal terms can be clearly related to life forms. For Berlin et al. this is proof that the principle of class inclusion holds for folk taxonomies as well, and this judgement has since been tacitly accepted by many researchers. However, the remaining 25 per cent of ‘aberrant cases’ do not only consist of borderline cases between two possible life forms. Ninety-seven, or 20 per cent, of the generic level categories were found to be ‘unaffiliated generics’, which means that they are not related to any superordinate life form in the eyes of the Tzeltal people. These ‘exceptions’ in fact make up the most interesting portion of the taxonomy because of their ‘economic importance’ and their ‘cultural significance’ (Berlin et al. 1974: 24, 96). Included among them are corn and beans, for example, certainly two basic ingredients of the Tzeltal diet.
The conclusion that can be drawn from these observations adds a fairly important point to our collection of characteristics of the generic level. As illustrated by categories like CORN and BEAN, the salience of the generic level seems above all to be due to its cultural significance; sometimes it is even rooted in basic biological needs. In other words, generic level categories represent the preferred cognitive perspective. They seem to meet ‘basic’ cognitive needs because they pinpoint where the focus of human interest lies. Regarding their position within hierarchies, generic categories are characterized by ‘taxonomic centrality’ (which is not to be confused with the intracategorial centrality of prototypes).
To sum up, anthropological research into one folk taxonomy has yielded a number of interesting cultural and linguistic findings which suggest the experiential primacy and centrality of the generic level:
• Folk taxonomies focus on the generic level, because it is often culturally salient and sometimes directly rooted in basic biological needs.
• The names for generic categories are readily available for human interaction: they first come to mind in naming situations, and their morphological structure is simple.
• Non-generic levels seem to have a subsidiary status, because they are not fully developed where there is no need for additional categorization.

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

Basic level categories: psychological factors
How can we support the claim that the centrality of the generic level meets ‘our basic cognitive needs’? Berlin et al.’s anthropological evidence, thorough and informative as it may be, is after all taken from the case study of a single folk taxonomy. Therefore it is worth reviewing what is known about the psychological background of the generic level (or basic level, as it is called in psychology) and examining the relevant experimental findings.
Summarizing early interpretations by Roger Brown and Paul Kay, the primacy and centrality of the basic level can be traced back to mainly three factors (Brown 1958, 1965; Kay 1971).
First, the generic or basic level is where we perceive the most obvious differences between the organisms and objects of the world. This becomes clearer when lower and higher levels of categorization are taken into account. The subordinate level categories ALSATIAN, COLLIE and GREYHOUND each contain category items which closely resemble the items in the neighbouring categories. For instance, all specimens of Alsatians, collies and greyhounds have a tail, they wag when they are happy, they all bark, all of them like to chase cats and postmen. Making distinctions between these categories may therefore seem almost pedantic. The superordinate category ANIMAL, on the other hand, embraces such a disparate variety of items (elephants, mice, whales, etc.) that the similarities are very small indeed. Against this background, basic level categories like DOG seem to strike a balance. Each kind of dog shows a great deal of similarity with other kinds of dog, yet all dogs are distinguished from cats, lions, etc., by what seem to be the characteristics of ‘dogginess’ (barking, tail wagging, etc.). In other words, the cognitive category DOG, and the basic level in general, normally ‘correspond to the most obvious discontinuities in nature’ (Kay 1971: 878).
A more technical explanation is possible in terms of attributes, which, as shown in Section 1.2, can be understood as representing similarity relations. Taking this into account, the claim that basic level categories achieve an ideal balance between internal similarity and external distinctiveness can now be rephrased in terms of attributes: the basic level is the level on which the largest bundles of naturally correlated attributes are available for categorization (e.g. all the attributes expressing ‘dogginess’ or ‘chairiness’). These bundles of attributes are as it were earmarked for the members of a certain cognitive category (e.g. DOG or CHAIR) and will be accorded to dog-like beings or chair-like objects in the real world according to their goodness-of-example status; at the same time these attribute bundles distinguish these categories from other

categories. Compare Figure 2.3, where the attributes available for the basic level categories CHAIR and TABLE are schematically represented by lines.
As the figure shows, each of the two cognitive categories commands a large bundle of attributes that would apply to most chairs or tables respectively. Thus all kinds of chairs (kitchen chairs, living room chairs, garden chairs) would agree with the attributes ‘has a seat’, ‘has a back’, ‘is used to sit on’. Only some of the attributes will be shared by both categories, e.g. ‘has legs’, ‘made of wood’ (in the figure these attributes are linked by an arrow), while most of them are not, and this reflects the ease with which we distinguish between chairs and tables.
Since attributes convey information, yet another view seems possible. As the notion of correlation implies, the bundles of attributes available on the basic level are already presorted, they have been conveniently linked up and are therefore more easily digestible. This is why it can be claimed that the basic level is where the largest amount of information about an item can be obtained with the least cognitive effort. This principle is called cognitive economy, and it probably explains best why the basic level is particularly well suited to meet our cognitive needs.4

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

The other two factors that are thought to be responsible for the primacy of the basic level can be dealt with more briefly. One is the common overall shape, which is perceived holistically and can be seen as an important indicator of gestalt perception (see Section 1.2). If organisms and objects are categorized on the basic level, it is obvious that all category members (e.g. all members of the category DOG) have a characteristic shape. This shape not only unites all kinds of dogs, but also distinguishes them from the members of other basic level categories, such as ELEPHANT, MOUSE and WHALE. If we approach organisms and objects on the superordinate level, the level of MAMMAL, REPTILE or INSECT, there is no common shape for the category which, to take the case of MAMMAL, applies to dogs, elephants, mice and whales. Since a common shape does not exist, it cannot, of course, be used to distinguish mammals from reptiles and insects. In contrast, categories on the subordinate level, the level of species like ALSATIAN and TERRIER, do have a common characteristic shape, just like basic level categories, and this shape is shared by all kinds of Alsatians or by all kinds of terriers. However, this shape is less helpful in distinguishing Alsatians from terriers because, both being dogs, the differences in shape are much smaller than between dogs and elephants or whales.
The third relevant factor is concerned with the actions or, more precisely, the motor movements we perform when we interact with objects and organisms. As Brown suggested, it is only on the basic level that organisms and objects are marked by really characteristic actions. Cats can be stroked, flowers can be sniffed, balls can be rolled and bounced, while it is difficult to imagine that different kinds of cats are stroked in different ways or that all animals are stroked like cats.
Experimental evidence for basic level categories
The experimental investigation of these psychological assumptions was again carried out by Rosch and her associates (Rosch et al. 1976), and the significance of all three factors for basic level categories was confirmed.
The first aspect, the balance between similarity and distinctiveness achieved in basic level categories, was tested in an attribute-listing task. The experiment was similar to the one employed in prototype research (see Section 1.2), but the perspective was a different one. This time the aim was to measure the size of the correlated bundles of attributes (which were taken to reflect both similarity and distinctiveness; see above) and to show that the size of the bundles was different from those on other levels of categorization. Informants were asked to list attributes for basic level categories,

UngeCh02v3.QXD 8/5/06 6:33 AM Page 73

LEVELS OF CATEGORIZATION

73

like APPLE, PEACH, GRAPE, for superordinate categories (in this case FRUIT) and for subordinate categories (e.g. DELICIOUS APPLE, MACINTOSH APPLE). The basic level categories (APPLE, PEACH, etc.) had an average total of eight attributes in common, while for the superordinate category FRUIT the number was three. The total for CAR, BUS, TRUCK (basic level) was 12 against only one common attribute for VEHICLE (superordinate). Similar scores were obtained for the other artefact categories tested (TOOL, FURNITURE, CLOTHING and MUSICAL INSTRUMENT). Attribute totals for subordinate categories (DELICIOUS APPLE, JEEP, etc.) were somewhat higher than for basic level categories, a result which will be put in perspective in Section 2.2.
The results did, however, deviate for the biological categories where, following Berlin et al., TREE, FISH and BIRD had been chosen as superordinate categories. As it turned out, the total numbers of attributes for these categories were as high as the average totals for MAPLE, BIRCH, BASS, TROUT, EAGLE, SPARROW, etc., the assumed basic level categories, so TREE, FISH and BIRD had to be regarded as the real basic level categories. After what has been said about cultural models (see Section 1.3), this is not surprising. It simply shows that cultural models do not only influence the selection of prototypes, but are equally important for the choice of the basic level perspective. Urbanized American psychology students, who are neither foresters nor otherwise dependent on the distinctions between maples, birches, oaks, pines, etc., will have a different perspective from the Tzeltal people who live agricultural lives and are much more bound up in their natural surroundings.
The second factor, the common overall shape, was addressed in two ways. One experiment was based on a comparison of outline drawings of category members. For the basic level category CAR these were the outlines of >SPORTS CAR<, >SALOON< and >ESTATE CAR<, etc., while the superordinate category VEHICLE was represented by the outlines of >CAR<, >BUS< and >MOTORCYCLE<. These outline drawings were derived from randomly selected pictures, which had been normalized for size and canonical orientation (side view for cars etc.). When these normalized outlines were juxtaposed, overlaps between the shapes of the various types of car were naturally much greater than between the outlines of a car, a bus and a motorcycle. This proves that it is easy enough to produce an average overall shape for basic level categories and to assume an underlying common gestalt, while this is not the case for superordinate categories. As for subordinate categories, like SPORTS CAR, the overlap between the outlines of category members, e.g. a>JAGUAR< and a >PORSCHE<, is even greater, and this was again in line with the test hypothesis (see also Section 2.2).

UngeCh02v3.QXD 8/5/06 6:33 AM Page 74

74

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

In a related experiment, an identification task, subjects were shown the overlapped outlines of basic level categories (e.g. a shape computed from the outlines of a sports car and an estate car for CAR) as well as similar combinations for superordinate categories (e.g. a shape combining the outlines of a car and a motorcycle for VEHICLE). Again the overlapped shapes of basic level categories were readily identified, and the combined shapes of superordinate categories were not.
To investigate the third factor, the motor movements, subjects were asked to imagine and describe the muscle movements they tend to produce when interacting with certain objects and organisms. Figure 2.4 provides two examples that show that motor movements are most diversified on the basic level, the level of CHAIR and PANTS, where the movements of sitting down and of putting on pants could be extracted from the informants in great detail. In contrast, the only human reactions which were considered to be stimulated by all types of furniture and all types of clothing, i.e. ‘eyes scan’ for FURNITURE and ‘eyes scan’ as well as ‘hands grasp’ for CLOTHING, are among the most general form of contact imaginable. On the subordinate level, little was added

to descriptions for the basic level categories, although it is interesting to note that the movements listed for LIVING ROOM CHAIR or LEVIS are exactly those that would be highlighted in advertisements for these items.
The symbiosis of basic level and prototype categories
As we have seen, some of the tests used in the investigation of the basic level were very similar to the experiments of prototype research. At first the two lines of investigation were pursued side by side, often with divergent aims, and it took some time before the relationship between the prototype structure and the basic level notion was sorted out and recognized for what it was, a perfect kind of symbiosis based on the following two interdependent principles:5
1. Prototype categories are most fully developed on the basic level. 2. Basic level categories only function as they do because they are struc-
tured as prototype categories.
To explain the first principle, it should be sufficient to recall two of the aspects of basic level categories which have just been discussed:
• The basic level provides the largest amount of relevant and digestible information about the objects and organisms of the world (e.g. information about bird-like animals) or, to put it more technically, it offers the largest bundles of correlated attributes. These attributes are accumulated in their most complete form in the prototype (>ROBIN< in the case of BIRD) and expressed by the category name (e.g. bird).
• The basic level is where the overlap of shapes is so great that it permits reliable gestalt perception, which is particularly easy for prototypical examples (like the >ROBIN<).
The second principle is best explained by claiming that prototypes maximize the efficiency of basic level categories (Rosch 1977, 1978). In more detail, this means:
• Prototypes maximize the distinctiveness of basic level categories because they attract not only the largest number of attributes shared inside the category, but also the largest number of attributes not shared with members of other categories (e.g. of all birds, the robin shares the smallest number of attributes with other kinds of animals).
• Prototypes maximize holistic perception because their gestalts integrate all functionally important parts.

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

All in all, basic level categories with prototypes seem to be just the kind of tools needed for the difficult task of categorizing the concrete objects and organisms of the world around us. Seen in the wider context of categorization which will unfold in the course of the book, basic level categories contribute a decisive share to the basic experiences that govern our interaction with the world around us.

3. As Rosch showed for chairs and pants (see Figure 2.4), we can name the largest number of typical movements when we categorize these objects on the basic level. Find out whether this is also true of bicycles, racing bikes, mopeds and vehicles, and of drills, hammers, saws, circular saws and tools.
4. When Rosch carried out her experiments of the basic level she found that for a former airplane mechanic the basic level had shifted from the category PLANE to more specific categories. Discuss the influence of the language user’s personal, geographical and social background on his choice of basic level categories for plants, animals and technical appliances. Make use of the information about context, cognitive and cultural models in Section 1.3.
5. Discuss whether in your opinion the notion of cognitive economy is only important for everyday categorization (or folk taxonomies) as opposed to scientific classifications and information processing in computers.
2.2 Superordinate and subordinate categories
If basic level categories are exceptional in many ways, how do other types of cognitive categories differ from them? Are other categories just to be regarded as poor relations or do they have specific functions for which they are uniquely equipped and which determine their category structure?

When choosing the cognitive categories for their investigation of prototypes, early researchers did not consciously distinguish between basic level categories and other kinds of categories. Quite naturally, they selected the categories that promised the best results for the demonstration of the individual effects of the prototype structure they had in mind. As shown in Chapter 1, gestalt characteristics of categories and the fuzziness of category boundaries could best be illustrated with basic level categories like CUP and BOWL. Goodness-ofexample ratings and attribute listings involving family resemblances worked well with cognitive categories such as FRUIT, FURNITURE and VEHICLE, which are commonly placed on a superordinate level. Yet when basic level categories were contrasted with the superordinate (and subordinate) categories in the last section, it became clear that an ideal prototype structure can only be found on the basic level and that, seen from this angle, superordinate categories are deficient in many ways.6
The structure of superordinate categories and the notion of parasitic categorization
To start with the most obvious deficiency of superordinate categories, there is no common overall shape and, consequently, no common underlying gestalt that applies to all category members. However, this does not mean that the objects categorized as FRUIT or FURNITURE or VEHICLE cannot be approached holistically. Consider what you would do if you were asked to provide a picture of these categories. You would probably draw an orange, a banana, etc. to illustrate FRUIT, or a chair, a table and a bed for FURNITURE, or a car, a bus and a motorbike for VEHICLE. In other words, you would ‘borrow’ the gestalt properties of the superordinate category from the basic level categories involved – a first case of what will be called parasitic categorization.7
This principle of parasitic categorization is also reflected in the way in which attributes are used in categorizing experiments. As already discussed in Sections 1.2 and 2.1, informants tend to list few category-wide attributes for superordinate categories. Indeed, in the case of FURNITURE, Rosch’s informants did not suggest a single common attribute. The most likely reason is that the common attributes available for FURNITURE are so general and unobtrusive that informants do not find them worth mentioning – think of ‘large movable objects’ or ‘things that make a house or flat suitable for living in’. Apart from category-wide attributes, informants offer the names of basic level categories which are members of the superordinate category and, in addition, attributes of these basic level categories. In the case of FURNITURE this means that informants will name the basic level categories CHAIR, TABLE, BED,

etc. and add a number of attributes from the attribute inventory of these cognitive categories, e.g. ‘has legs’, ‘has a back’, ‘used to sit on’ for CHAIR, etc. This situation is schematically represented in Figure 2.5.
If one compares the superordinate category FURNITURE with the basic level categories CHAIR and TABLE, the difference in terms of attributes and categorization is indeed striking. While both CHAIR and TABLE are largely self-sufficient in terms of categorizing attributes (as was already illustrated by Figure 2.3), there are only few attributes that emanate directly from the superordinate category FURNITURE (e.g. ‘movable objects’, ‘make a room suitable for living in’), and even these attributes are shared by CHAIR and TABLE, as indicated by the converging attribute lines in Figure 2.5. The bulk of the attributes are borrowed from the rich attribute inventories of the basic level categories CHAIR and TABLE – a clear case of parasitic categorization.
Yet why is it that we normally do not realize that we draw the attributes for the superordinate category FURNITURE from basic level categories, and in fact from quite diverse basic level categories, such as CHAIR, TABLE, SOFA, BED, SHELF and CUPBOARD? This seems to be mainly due to the family resemblances which can be observed between category members. When the notion of family resemblance was introduced in Section 1.2, it was used to justify the category membership of poor examples, e.g. to explain why penguins and ostriches can be called birds or laptops and coffee machines can be seen as (rather marginal) items of furniture. Starting from superordinate categories such as FURNITURE, family resemblances appear in a different light.

LEVELS OF CATEGORIZATION

79

Looking at the attributes of FURNITURE that are borrowed from the member categories once more, we find that there is indeed quite a lot of overlap. Both CHAIR and TABLE seem to have attributes like ‘has legs’ and ‘made of wood, metal or plastic’ in common (this is indicated in Figure 2.5 by the two vertical bundles of attributes in the centre linked by the double arrow). Other attributes available for FURNITURE will be shared by CHAIR and SOFA, by SOFA and BED, by TABLE and SHELF, by SHELF and CUPBOARD. The effect of these overlaps is that in describing FURNITURE we never think that we are just borrowing isolated attributes from the respective basic level categories like CHAIR, TABLE or BED. Rather we have the impression that each of the borrowed attributes is relevant for a large section of the FURNITURE category, though it may in fact only apply to two or three member categories.
This effect of the family resemblance principle is even more important in the case of superordinate categories like TOY, for which we can find only a single category-wide attribute (our proposal for TOY is ‘used to play with’), not to mention Wittgenstein’s extreme case of the category GAME, where it is difficult to extract even a single category-wide attribute. (Frequent associations are ‘spending time in a basically pleasant way’, ‘leisure activity’, ‘fun’ and others.) Here it is quite obvious that the attributes available for the description of the superordinate category are overwhelmingly based on family resemblances between various types of toys or games, all of them basic level categories, and that these basic level categories are activated by parasitic categorization.
To round off the picture, one might point out that the non-basic status of superordinate categories is also reflected linguistically. Many words for superordinate categories do not belong to the simple one-syllable type which is dominant among basic level terms; this is true of FURNITURE, VEHICLES, MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS, for instance. In addition, superordinate terms do not normally come to mind first, i.e. before the respective basic level terms, and they are learned by children only after basic level words have been acquired.
Subordinate categories: characteristics of category structure
The most frequent type of lexical category apart from basic level categories are not superordinate, but subordinate categories. There are many kinds of dogs, of flowers, of cars and boats, of beds and tables, and all of them can be understood in terms of cognitive categories. In some cases, the structure of these subordinate categories is very similar to the structure of basic level categories. Categories like POODLE, TERRIER or ROSE have identifiable gestalts,

they are constructed round prototypes, have good and bad members, can muster substantial lists of attributes and are expressed by simple words. However, when we follow Brown (1990) and turn to more extreme examples of subordinate categories, the differences become more marked.
Sticking to flowers, but replacing ROSE with DANDELION or DAISY, we still have a fairly clear gestalt perception, including the holistic impression of the overall shape, the jagged leaves, the yellow blossom of dandelions or the distinction between the yellow disc and the white rays typical of daisies. The difference between these categories and a category such as ROSE becomes obvious when we start looking for prototypes of dandelions or daisies. How does an ordinary language user, someone who is neither a botanist nor a lexicologist, single out a perfect dandelion or daisy? How does he or she describe the difference between this perfect specimen and a poor one? Indeed, the average language user will hardly attempt to distinguish prototypical dandelions and daisies from less typical category members, both in terms of individual examples and varieties. Moving from natural kinds to man-made objects, such as coins, we find that subordinate categories like DIME or QUARTER also do not yield prototypes that can be easily distinguished from more marginal examples. All dimes and quarters are very much alike, and can be regarded as equally good examples of the category. The reason is not that real-life examples of dandelions, daisies, dimes or quarters are in fact identical, the differences in shape or colour (in the case of dandelions and daisies) or in newness and gloss (for dimes and quarters) which might emerge in a thorough scrutiny are simply irrelevant for everyday categorization and do not influence our holistic perception.
The question is how this obvious indifference towards the details of subordinate categories squares with Rosch’s findings that informants have no difficulty in compiling lengthy attribute lists for these categories, lists that are even more detailed than those provided for basic level categories.
As Rosch herself observed, only some of these attributes are specific to the subordinate category in question, while the majority are identical with the attributes of the respective basic level category. Applied to our flower categories this means that the jagged shape of the dandelion’s leaves and the distinction between the daisy’s yellow disc and white rays would rank among the small number of specific attributes. Everything else that can be said about the bloom, the stem and the leaves, i.e. all the other attributes of DANDELION and DAISY, will be borrowed from the basic level category FLOWER; this can again be regarded as a case of parasitic categorization. Compare Figure 2.6.
This figure should be seen in conjunction with Figure 2.5, which illustrates the categorization of superordinate categories. In both cases the bulk

of the categorization is carried out through basic level categories while direct categorization (indicated by bold lines) is limited to a few attributes. Yet there is a crucial difference which concerns the quality of the attributes available for direct categorization. In the case of superordinates this is a set of general attributes that are also shared by all the basic level categories (e.g. the attributes ‘large movable object’ and ‘makes a house suitable for living in’, which are shared by chairs, tables and many other items of furniture). In contrast, the attributes available for direct categorization of subordinate categories are specific, i.e. they specify the category in question; they are not normally shared by other categories: jagged leaves are a characteristic property of dandelions and not part of the attribute lists of DAISY, ROSE or TULIP.

The functions of non-basic categories
Specific and general attributes of subordinate and superordinate categories respectively are a good starting point to explain the cognitive function of non-basic categories. The reason why we use subordinate categories is that we want to stress or ‘highlight’ the specific attributes they feature. If we want to distinguish a flower with jagged leaves and a yellow blossom from other types of flowers, we choose the relevant subcategory and communicate this by using its label, the word dandelion. If botanists want to go further and point out a specific colour of the blossom they may use a term

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

such as white-flowering Japanese dandelion to indicate a more finely graded subcategorization. Whether the highlighting function of the subordinate category refers to colour (as in our example) or to shape, material or the use to which an item is put (e.g. use of dandelions in salads and soups) does not make any difference. It can be shown that, for different items, all these aspects are eligible for highlighting.
For superordinate categories, successful highlighting cannot be so easily deduced from the generality of an attribute, which is shared by a set of basic level items, e.g. by chairs, tables, beds, etc. or by cars, buses, vans and trucks. Obviously, only certain of these ‘general’ attributes are judged salient enough to be highlighted, while others are not. Trying to assemble the attributes for BUS, one would not just want to mention that it is used to move people and things around; one would probably like to add that a bus has a box-like shape, that it has wheels, doors and windows and also seats, and that it holds a large number of people. Or one may even want to stress that, given the right size, a bus is used by children to play with. If we survey the linguistic evidence we find that all these attributes can be easily expressed as sentences or clauses (as has just been done in fact), yet only some of them have actually sparked off specific superordinate lexical items that can be used freely. Compare Figure 2.7, where the selected attributes are indicated by single quotes, the superordinate categories that might be based on them are indicated by capitals, and the actual linguistic realizations are printed in italics.
As it emerges from Figure 2.7, only the two attributes ‘moves people and things around’ and ‘used to play with’ have generated freely usable lexemes, namely vehicle and toy. The words seater and wheeler can only be used in

certain collocations, such as a 50-seater or a 6-wheeler (which is more likely to be used of a lorry or truck), while *windower is not acceptable as a lexical item, and box would not be readily understood as a superordinate of bus. The reason why only vehicle and toy (and in numerical compounds seater) have been established as lexical items seems to be that their underlying cognitive categories are supported by attributes referring to what may be regarded as the most salient quality of artefacts: their function or purpose. Calling a bus vehicle, we automatically stress its function of moving persons or things around: calling it 50-seater we emphasize that a bus is capable of carrying a large number of people. Referring to a bus as toy, we again stress a specific though very different function. Other attributes apart from function which seem to be so salient that they support names for superordinate cognitive categories include ‘material’ (for TEXTILES, MINERALS and EARTHENWARE), ‘origin’ (for ANCESTORS), ‘relatedness’ (for RELATIVES, IN-LAWS).
Highlighting attributes, however, is not the only function of superordinate categories. Closely linked with it is a second function, and this becomes more obvious when we look at Figure 2.8, which shows the attribute links between superordinate categories like VEHICLE and TOY and related basic level categories. While it seems quite natural that VEHICLE is related to CAR, BUS, MOTORBIKE, etc., through the attribute ‘moves people and things around’(and that, conversely, CAR, BUS, MOTORBIKE can be seen as types of vehicles), the wide range of links emanating from TOY may be surprising at first sight: relevant basic level categories include not only CAR and BUS, but also BALL and SWING, and the list could be extended almost indefinitely; nevertheless, CAR, BUS, SWING and BALL can all be seen in a type-of relationship to the superordinate TOY.

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

It is with categories like TOY that the enormous potential of what we will call the collecting function of superordinate categories becomes really obvious: the faculty to subsume a large number of categories under one label which makes the whole set of categories available for easy handling. It is not surprising that this potential has been used for scientific purposes and that collecting items under a common heading has become a crucial aspect of scientific work. The extension of the type-of relationship across ever more levels has led to the establishment of extensive scientific taxonomies. The detailed biological classifications or Roget’s attempt to organize lexical categories as a multi-level taxonomy are cases in point. When these scientific taxonomies were introduced in Section 2.1, we found that they differ widely from folk taxonomies as used by the Tzeltal people for plants. These differences can now be explained in terms of the highlighting and collecting functions of superordinate categories.
Exercises
1. Ask your fellow-students to list attributes for the following categories: CHAIR, BED, LAMP; KNIFE, FORK, SPOON; RING, BRACELET, NECKLACE; FURNITURE; CUTLERY; JEWELLERY; KITCHEN CHAIR, DINING ROOM CHAIR, ARMCHAIR, WICKER CHAIR; BREAD KNIFE, POCKET KNIFE, JACK KNIFE, PAPER KNIFE, CARVING KNIFE; EARRING, NOSE RING, WEDDING RING, DIAMOND RING, SIGNET RING.
Test whether your lists support Rosch’s findings about the attribute inventories of basic level, superordinate and subordinate categories. 2. Considering BOOK, JOURNAL, NEWSPAPER, E-MAIL and WEBSITE as basic level categories, suggest subordinate and superordinate categories related to these categories. Which of the possible superordinate categories have given rise to lexical items in English? Which dimensions (shape, colour, material, origin, function) are highlighted? 3. Compare the ratio of basic level, superordinate and subordinate level words in a sample of scientific text to that in a sample of a fairytale or children’s story. 4. The notion of ‘parasitic categorization’ is based on the view that superordinate categories ‘borrow’ attributes from basic level categories.

Alternatively, one might say that basic level categories supply the attributes which are then ‘transferred’ to the respective superordinate categories. Which view do you find more convincing? 5. How is the notion of parasitic categorization reflected in pictograms for fruit, vegetables, toiletries, stationary, electrical appliances, luggage, motorized vehicles and pedestrians?
2.3 Conceptual hierarchies
Basic, subordinate and superordinate categories are the building material of type-of hierarchies. However, there is competition from part–whole relationships. The latter gain in importance if we do not focus on scientific hierarchies, but on the folk hierarchies observed in ordinary language use.
Scientific and folk taxonomies revisited
Discussing the Tzeltal plant taxonomy in Section 2.1, we found that while there is a superordinate category TREE for the basic level categories PINE, WILLOW and other kinds of trees, there is no such category for CORN and BEAN. Obviously it is convenient for the Tzeltal people to highlight one or several salient properties common to all the kinds of trees they know, e.g. ‘consist of a trunk, branches and leaves or needles’, ‘provide shade’ or ‘used as fire wood’. In contrast, the fact that both CORN and BEAN are grown in fields and used as food is so self-evident that within the cultural model of the non-Westernized agricultural Tzeltal community they need not be highlighted. And since there are only few items involved, there is no reason to collect them in a special superordinate category.
The picture changes when we return to industrialized societies and the cultural model based on them, and when we survey the almost infinite variety of food items available. In such a context various superordinates such as VEGETABLES, FRUIT, CEREAL and even FOOD seem to be very useful indeed. Imagine the chaos that would be created in supermarkets if the food items were not arranged with respect to these superordinate categories. The same applies to non-food categories such as STATIONERY, TOILETRIES, CLOTHING and ELECTRICAL APPLIANCES. How could anybody find their way around one of the larger department stores if it were not for the signs carrying these linguistic labels? While this illustrates the collecting function of superordinates, their highlighting function is exploited in the labelling of individual goods, especially with new products. Whether it is a newly introduced kind of exotic fruit or a

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

new type of precooked dish, it will often be necessary to clarify their purpose or function, and this is where the superordinate category label will at least provide a first clue.
However, although a large number of superordinate categories may be necessary to cope with the ever-expanding range of goods and services, this does not mean that ordinary language users are in any way as consistent in their use of superordinates as scientists are. This is particularly true when it comes to establishing multi-level hierarchies. While it is the aim of scientific classifications to provide a complete system of taxonomic levels, experiential everyday categorization may very well be prepared to skip some levels, even if, from a logical point of view, they make sense and have been lexicalized.
A good example is the superordinate category MAMMAL, which undoubtedly highlights the important attributes ‘born from the mother’s womb’ and ‘fed by milk from the mother’s body’. Admittedly mammal is not only used in scientific discourse, but also in ordinary conversation when these attributes are focused. Yet as a rule, language users will regard ANIMAL rather than MAMMAL as the direct superordinate of DOG and CAT. Similarly, INSECT is not generally seen as a natural superordinate category for BEETLE though it may be more readily accepted as superordinate for FLY, MOSQUITO, WASP and BEE. The issue becomes more complex when we consider that for many language users BIRD and FISH are not subordinated to ANIMAL, so if we look for a superordinate category we have to opt for CREATURE, and this raises another problem. For CREATURE has biblical associations for many language users (‘God’s creatures’), or at least it highlights the aspect of creation at the expense of other aspects of ‘animality’. Looking for a more comprehensive superordinate we have to go as far as LIVING BEING, and this is obviously a category which includes plants as well. From this we may conclude that there is no satisfactory superordinate for MAMMAL, BIRD, FISH, REPTILE and INSECT or, to put it differently, that English does not have a comprehensive labelled category that can be used for ‘animals’ as opposed to plants.8
Yet this wider sense of animal becomes available when we use the composite terms higher animal and lower animal and consider the respective categories. HIGHER ANIMAL is largely equivalent with the restricted conception of ANIMAL suggested above and mainly refers to mammals, while LOWER ANIMAL embraces INSECT and REPTILE. This still leaves us with BIRD and FISH, which cannot be safely related to either HIGHER ANIMAL or LOWER ANIMAL. Figure 2.9 is an attempt to sketch this rather confused situation. In this figure the superordinate categories of neutral everyday categorization are printed in bold letters and linked to basic level categories by bold lines. Other superordinate

categories are given in brackets and linked to the respective categories by normal lines.
Looking at the diagram one might easily get the impression that this classification is indeed most unsatisfactory. This may be true if the matter is approached from a purely logical point of view. Considering the cognitive needs of the ordinary language user, however, one will come to understand that it may be helpful to have the superordinate category ANIMAL (or HIGHER ANIMAL) to refer to the living beings that seem most relevant to human beings, such as dogs, cats and horses, and it may also be useful if insects and reptiles can be treated in a rather summary fashion under the label LOWER ANIMAL. Birds and fish may indeed hold an intermediate position between the larger domestic animals and the lower animals, which does not call for an immediate superordinate category as the other animals do.
Summarizing this cognitive view of lexical hierarchies as employed by ordinary language users one might say that these ‘folk taxonomies’ are characterized by gaps, inconsistencies and alternative paths (i.e. offering both MAMMAL and ANIMAL as superordinates for DOG and CAT). What is reassuring is that this picture is fully supported by the experiences of practically minded lexicographers, both in the definitions of superordinate terms and in the hierarchical framework of Thesaurus-type dictionaries.9 Lexicologists and linguists in general who have been reared in the tradition of rigid classification will be more sceptical, but even they should be appeased by the fact that in spite of the obvious differences between lexical folk taxonomies and logical hierarchies both can be accommodated in a wider cognitive framework.

AN INTRODUCTION TO COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS

Type-of hierarchies vs part–whole hierarchies
The notion of conceptual hierarchy becomes even more complex when we consider a relationship that is pervasive in the world around us, but was somewhat neglected in earlier cognitive studies: the part–whole relationship.10 Nobody will deny that there is a close connection between finger and hand, hand and arm, arm and body, and this applies to other body parts as well. Similarly, the link between tyre and wheel, wheel and car (and other components of cars) is just one of many examples of part–whole relationships for artefacts. This suggests that part–whole relationships are directly based on observable links between things; they can be described in terms of the spatial contiguity (i.e. nearness) and continuity of individual objects in the real world, and this is why they seem to be closer to concrete reality than type-of relationships (Cruse 1986: 178). A cognitive-linguistic view of part– whole relations will emphasize that they are based on our familiarity with our own body and its parts, which is clearly one type of basic experience.11 Like other kinds of basic experiences, among them basic level categories, part–whole relationships may thus have a high cognitive accessibility, and this is reflected in a short processing time and the immediacy of gestalt perception, in which the idea of wholes and their parts (body and limbs or chair, legs, seat and back, etc.) plays a central role (see Section 1.1).
Unlike many taxonomic superordinates such as VEHICLE or MUSICAL INSTRUMENT, part–whole ‘superordinates’ like BODY, CAR or HOUSE are not superordinates per se, but basic level categories that can be activated as superordinates if needed. If one thinks of LIVING ROOM, BEDROOM and KITCHEN, it makes sense to relate these part categories to their common ‘whole’, the category HOUSE. With regard to its cognitive function, the superordinate category HOUSE does not highlight a single or a few attributes of its ‘members’, as is typical of type-of superordinates (ROOM for LIVING ROOM, BEDROOM, KITCHEN, etc.). Its strength is its assembling function, the notion that the category HOUSE is thought of as being composed of LIVING ROOM, BEDROOM, etc., and the same assembling function is fulfilled by KITCHEN with regard to COOKER, FRIDGE and KITCHEN TABLE or by TOWN with regard to HOUSE, SHOP and STREET. While type-of superordinates collect things on the basis of conceptualized similarities, part-whole superordinates assemble things on the basis of their conceptualized co-presence in time and space. It is in this sense that we talk of part–whole hierarchies or partonomies.12* As the prime example of BODY
* We avoid the term ‘meronomy’, as it is easily confused with ‘metonymy’, which is discussed in Chapter 3. ‘Partonomy’ is used to refer to hierarchies while the relationship between individual parts and wholes is called ‘partonymic’.
