Introduction
situation which has been most influential for the fonn that spoken lan­ have is arguably the face-te-face encOlmter. We take it as a scenario been described by sociologists, social psychologists, anthropologists
linguists, and which rather unaniniiously has been characterized as a iorrlJ1l1mi,cative situation that is inherently multimodal.

Adam Kendon, inspired by Goffman (1967), was interested in the interac" tional aspects of this situation and he has devoted many of his early to finding "responses to Erving Goffman's (1967) call for a study of 'ultimate behavioral materials' of interaction. [. ..J That is, [. . .J 'the g'"jj�<�' gestures, positions and verbal statements' that constitute the stuff of tac:e-!I)" face encounters" (Kendon 1990: ix). David Efron, one of the pioneers gesture studies, directed attention to the fact that the hand gestures seem to use unwittingly and very regularly when they converse with other are so deeply intertwined with spoken language that in his empirical investigation of cross-cultural differences between Jewish and Italian grants to New York City he distinguishes "spatia-temporal aspects,

Herb Clark, in turn, has described the face-to-face situation of cOlnr:rlUn icai tion as the "canonical encounter" of human beings:
From the social psychologist's viewpoint, man is a social animal, who
perhaps even needs, to interact socially with other people. What are the acteristics of the most usual interaction between two people, John and For our purposes, the most important property is that they will be facing
other a short distance apart. It is in this position that John and Mary are
. ated for the optimal perception of messages - both verbal and nonverbal
from the other person. John is in Mary's positive perceptual field, and Mary ' ,
in John's. If John and Mary were side by side, or back to back, o r back
front, or in any other position, these conditions would no longer be optimal. is no accident that nonnal ·conversations are carried out face-to-face. face-to-face situation is wbat I would like to refer to, for convenience, as .
canonical encounter (Clark 1973: 34-35).
Granting that the canonical encounter as described above does not imply co-participants literally face each other,1 it is a form of interaction which extremely common in the cultures of many areas of the world and does imply reciprocal audibility and visibility (although to varying de!7e<:s) This face-to-face encounter between two people will be the context in we will treat the use of spoken language in this chapter. As Clark indicat:e! the use of spoken language in this context is inherently a process of modal communication, involving not only the oral production of sound its aural reception, but also the production of various kinds of bodily in space, which the addressee can perceive visually. The multimodal of spoken communication has been especially emphasized in recent years those researching spontaneous gesture with speech, suggesting that

and speech are visible and audible actions that form one single utterance Kendon 2004) or proposing that gesture and speech are dynamically in different forms of thought but constitute one integrated system (e.g.,
: McNeill 1992, 2005). Given that spoken language involves multiple modali­ . it makes sense that metaphor should have the potential for multimodal­ ..' ity when used in this form of communication; and indeed over the past years
a substantial body of research on metaphor in gesture, speech, and sign
(larlgu:age has been carried out (cf. Bouvet 1997, 2001; Calbris 1998,2000,
Cienki 1998,2005b; Cienki and Muller 2008a, 2008b; McNeill 1992; :JMittellbel:g 2006; Mittelberg and Waugh, this volume; Muller 1998, 2008;
2004; Nunez and Sweetser 2006; Webb 1996; Wilcox 2000, 2004). The topic we want to explore here in particular is the different forms that ",Illt!ltirmo,dal metaphors may take in face-to-face communication. We will ·sp'eciitlc:ally concentrate on the kinds of relations between metaphors that are
f;!ealil�ed in speech and/or gesture. It is not by accident that the study of
i111 ltal)hc)r is increasingly taking data from gesture studies into account (e.g., �""j.jl\ and Muller 2008a, 2008b; Muller 2008) and this chapter offers a ,sYJ;ternatic account of the forms of metaphors that occur either in speech or
gesture or in both modalities at the same time. However, we would also to point out that beyond gesture, tI,ere are additional properties of spo­ communication which have received much less or no attention in terms
:'nf'thp;, implications for the expression of metaphor, including prosodic fea­ such as stress and intonation, and the time course in which all of these
:exl)re�;shre forms are used during acts of speaking (for the latter point see 2007, 2008).
In order to clarify what we are discussing, we will restrict the term "mo­ "'".Ill" to two dimensions of face-to-face communication: one will refer to
is expressed orally and perceived primarily aurally as sound (the iUr:.U'Lur:al modality), and the other will refer to bodily forms and movements
space which are primarily perceived visually (the spatiaVvisual modality). this sense, we will see that gesture/word combinations can constitute mul­ ftinlodal metaphors. Within each modality, there are various forms which can used for expressive purposes. In the oraVaural modality, intonation and
can be discussed separately from each other and separately from the being articulated. We will refer to these as different articulatory forms this modality. Similarly within the spatiaVvisual modality, eye gaze, shifts, manual gestures, etc., can all be considered different expressive Our understanding of articulatory form partially overlaps with Force­ s use of the term mode. In his critical stance towards giving "a satisfac­ definition of 'mode'" or of compiling "an exhaustive list of modes,"

300 Cornelia Muller and A/an Cienki
Forceville argues that this fundamental difficulty "is no obstacle for lating that there are different modes and that these include, at least, the
lowing: (1) pictorial signs; (2) written signs; (3) spoken signs; (4) gesltures;i;
(5) sounds; (6) music; (7) smells; (8) tastes; (9) touch" (Forceville
382-3/this volume). In short, spoken words and gestures are articulat'Dry; forms or modes, which are realized in an auralloral or spatiallvisual mc)aa.4i ity.
After presenting an overview of what appear to be the most. cOlnrrloDi ways in which the use of metaphor can play out in the orallaural and tiallvisual modalities and articulatory forms, we will point out the inller.enf dynamic nature of metaphors when used in spoken interaction. Even1:ually' we will suggest that these observations indicate that multinlOdal metap'hol� are products of the process of creating metaphoricity (by a sp'llk.er/ge�;tUJ·eg and ideally also by a listener/perceiver), which is essentially independent

that the different modalities and forms that are involved in spoken intenlctiiOlli
afford 'the use of different expressions for metaphors. What one can expr<$��
via a given modality and expressive form will have an effect on what
will express using that modality. We will conclude by considering the
cations this has for how we can think with metaphors while we are SP"Mll!l< or attending to someone who is speaking.
2. Monomodal and muItimodal metaphors in words and gestures
aM To begin with we need to clarify our understanding of mono- and mLtititno(l
metaphors. Following Forceville (2006: 383), we will consider as monolno; dal those metaphors "whose target and source are exclusively or pTl�dc)mii;l nantly rendered in one mode." This means we will distinguish mClne,m,)daq, verbal metaphors from monomodal gestural metaphors. We will consider multimodal those metaphors "whose target and source are each rerlrel;enlled' exclusively or predominantly in different modes" (Forceville 2006: 384), for the present chapter this means that we will document and discuss ""'mn_ gestural metaphors. In fact, and even more precisely, tllis means that we are. . actually talking about verbal and gestural, or verbo-gestural m,:tal)hc)ric expressions, since the phenomenological level we are concerned with in
analysis is that of verbal, gestural, or verbo-gestural utterances. If, and
how, these expressions relate to a general level of conceptual me,tajlho'rs':
(such as LOVE IS A JOURNEY) remains unaddressed. We do, however, con- ,

Words, gestures, and beyond 301
sider the meaning of those metaphoric expressions - be they verbal, gestural,
pr a combination of both - to be conceptual (adhering to the cognitive Jin­
"gulistiic assumption that meaning in general is "conceptual"). Thus for the
of brevity only we will henceforth use the terms metaphor and meta­ :"DllOrzc expressions as synonyms in this chapter, unless otherwise indicated.
Second it is central to illustrate what we mean by "gesture." Here we will focusing on visible, effortful movements of parts of the body whose pri­
purpose is apparently not that of self-adjustment (for example, as with ,gI'oolmir'19 behavior) or object manipulation (such as lifting a cup to take a .,' ___"" One could focus on many different parts of the body, such as head ;gestures, eye movements, foot gestures, body shifts, shoulder shrugs, and so
Here we will focus on positions, orientations, and movements of the and forearms; these are what we will mean henceforth with the term
;'",,,tllre." unless specified otherwise. Which gestures will be considered metaphoric? Here we will restrict the
discussion to gestures whose prinlary function can be identified as abstract
Miiller (1998: 110-1) notes that referential gestures can refer
to physical objects, properties, actions, Or relations, or to abstract �;ne'tiOl ls in terms of such physical means. Thus the same two-handed gesture
thumb and index finger on each hand forming a 90 degree angle could used when tallcing about a picture frame or when describing the "frame­ "',',or�'" of a tlleory. Abstract referential gestures are inherently metaphoric by virtue of rendering a non-physical idea in terms of a physical, spatio­
representation. We can note that a concrete referential gesture can be metaphoric in certain contexts (e.g., when someone imitates an ani­ referring to a person in a derogatory way), but we will not focus on such �,usa��e here, as we have found it extremely rare in our research to date. We should also mention our criteria for identifying verbal expressions as
For this we rely on the procedure developed by the Pragglejaz ,ur,oup (2007), with language-specific adaptations, as appropriate. To put it '.,brletly, the procedure has been designed for the identification of (a) when a . word is being used in a given context with a meaning which is different from
physically more basic meaning that it may have, and (b) when the
;'c,ontexl:ual meaning is interpreted via comparison with tlle more basic mean­

302 Cornelia Mii/ler andAlan Cienki
English, German, Cuban Spanish, and Russian. The conversations in language were elicited from pairs of native speakers, and were on abi;tr�LCt' topics so as to increase the likelihood of use of metaphoric expressions. English and Russian conversations were between pairs of university sUldents" who were talking about how they take exams at their universities (in United States and Russia, respectively). The German data come from dIe-aged German women who were talking with the researcher (the first thor) about their first love relationship. The Cuban data were all recorded Havana. Participants were asked to give accounts of important events their lives (a wedding) or to talk about life in Cuba in general. They roughly of the same age (in their thirties, with one exception of a speake�', who was 54 years old), and mixed with regard to gender.
Each example cited here comes from a different conversation, lm��<"" noted otherwise. Each line in the transcript indicates a new intonation (see Chafe 1994 on intonation units as wlits of analysis for spoken course). A comma (,) indicates an intonation unit with a terminal pitch signals continuation, a period/full stop (.) marks a final intonation unit ling to a low pitch at the end, and a double dash (--) shows that the mt(llaiki tion Wlit was truncated. A longer pause by the given speaker is incliC2Ltec�� with three dots (...), and a shorter One with two (..). In the transcription the examples, each separate gesture is indicated by a number (G1, G2, hands involved in gesturing are noted as rh, Ih, bh, indicating right, left both hands; the onset of gesture notation is synchronized in the transe,rip!,' with the beginning of the gestural movement and bold face indicates the tire duration of gestural movement (preparation, stroke, retraction, cf. don 2004; McNeill 1992).
Building on the possible relations that Cienki (1998) has found betwe,en;, metaphors expressed in words and in gestures and on Miiller's (2008) cussion of different reahns of metaphor, we will now give an overview what is known about the manners in which metaphor may be expressed speech in real tinle, that is: in one modality (spoken words or gestures) or a combination of the two. Put differently, we will offer a sketch of appear to be common forms of mono- and multimodal metaphors in words' and/or gestures.
3. Monomodal metaphors: source and target within one modality
First, we can confrrm that we often find the use of metaphoric verbal expres­ sions without co-occurring metaphoric gestures. For example, one American '

Words, gestures, and beyond 303
student talks about how people may verbalize certain beliefs about honesty, , but sometinles might not behave in accordance with them. At this point she , says (Example 1):
Example I: Just because ofthe pressure, thepeer pressure,
• The word "pressure" was coded as metaphoric in this context because "peer " pressure" normally involves behaviors other than physical pressing - tl1e , more basic physical meaning of the word. Even if peer pressure involved
physical contact, the word still can be understood with the abstract sense of coercive behavior (it has potential metaphoricity). Although ti,e word was coded as metaphorically used, the speaker made no gestures while saying it either tinle, keeping her hands resting on her leg as she was sitting. We might " refer to such a use of metaphor purely on the verbal level as monomodal " metaphor or as verbal metaphoric expression.
We also find the converse monomodal pattern of metaphor use: meta­ expressed in gestures without metaphors in the co-occurring speech,
that is, gestural metaphoric expressions that are used concurrently with , speech. Example 2 comes from one of the Russian students talking about
how they take exams at their university. An English translation is provided below the transliterated transcript of tile Russian. The student is trying to characterize the Russian concept of "chestnost '," which may be translated

,Example 2 (from Russian): Dlia menia chestnost' eto nekaja absoliutnaia kategoriia.

For me chestnost'is a kind of absolute category.

downward in unison, maintaining their position relative to each other and in the vertical plane. Here the speaker explicitly uses the gesture to reference - if you don't see the gesture, you don't know what he thinks
means to act honestly ("chestno"). The speaker uses a verbal deictic no,"!;"l..
to direct the attention of his co-participant to the gesture: "like this" no;nt<tc the gesture, and his hands move in temporal coordination with the deictic. Thus verbally he makes clear that the gesture contains relevant formation, but there is no verbal mention of a metaphoric source. In instance, manner of behavior (honest) is expressed gesturally as a ph�lsicl!l form (flat/straight) with a certain motion (brief and straight). (See
1999 for further discussion of this and related examples.)
Note that this is a particularly interesting case, since not only are the ture's source and target independent from any verbal metaphoric eX1JressilJll (in fact there is none in the concurrent speech), but the gestural metaph0I1c expression is used in place of words. Thus we might speculate whether is an instance of a multinlodal utterance consisting of a monomodal ge;;tural metaphoric expression which is being inserted into a verbal utterance.
Anotl,er type of gestural metaphoric expression that is very among different cultures involves gestures which perform a speech-act more generally a communicative activity. These are gestures that recur in form and function over a large amount of contexts and therefore we them recurrent gestures (cf. Bressem and Ladewig in prep.; Ladewig prep.; TeBendorfin prep. a., b). Examples are the pahn-up-open-hand
iji (cf. Kendon 2004; Muller 2004; Streeck 1994), the ring gesture (FaLtfouta
prep.; Kendon 2004; Morris 1977; Neumann 2004), or the brushing gesture (Muller and Speckmann 2002; Speckmann 1999; TeBendorf in
a, b). These gestures all share a common origin, in that they are all
nymic derivations of everyday actions (cf. Mittelberg 2006; Mittelberg Waugh, this volwne; Mittelberg and Muller in prep.; Muller 1998, in a, b; Muller and Haferland 1997; Streeck 1994): presenting, offering
receiving something (the palm-up-open-hand gesture); picking up small jects with the index finger and thwnb (the ring gesture); or brushing small objects. What we observe in these gestures is a two-step >�llillO'JC
!lJ, process as identified and described by Mittelberg and Waugh (this volurn
in which the metonymic target of the sign-formation process turns into
source of the metaphoric gesture (see also Mittelberg 2007). The targets
the metonymic process in our cases are the modulated actions: i.e., part ,

Words, gestures, and beyond 305

the action stands for the action as a whole, thus consituting a "classical" instance of a synecdochic relation (Muller in prep. a., b). This modulated 'a"non is used now as a metaphoric source for symbolizing abstract issues
as presenting a discourse object on the palm-up-open-hand, indicating preciseness of argwnents, or brushing aside unpleasant topics. For in­ "=,,,� the brushing aside gesture is widely used to express negative assess­
;menl:S, and this is what we will see in the next example. Example 3 comes free conversations recorded in Cuba (Muller and Speckmann 2002;
• Speckmann 1999). (For a detailed analysis of the brushing aside gesture
by speakers of the Iberian Peninsula, see TeBendorf in prep. a., b).
In Example 3 the speaker thinks out loud about the possible conse­
';-qlten,�es of what it would be like to have four instead of two TV-channels in -.; ,",,"-'<1. He is convinced that this would disturb family life by causing endless idiscu:ssi,ons about which program to watch. He describes the big argwnents
would raise in a very lively way, and in doing this becomes himself part such an inlaginary situation: he imagines himself standing in the living
and he indicates three different places, each of them relating to a dif­ -"I1'J'�m person voting emphatically for another program: "Yo quiero vel 'aql�eulo yo quiero ver 10 otro yo quiero ver esto" ("I want to see this one, I
to see that one, I want to see the other one"). The more programs to i,cb,oo;;e from, the more arguments you have in your family - this is the moral
the speaker's imagined scenario. It is clearly not desirable to have four
"cbanrle]s on Cuban TV and correspondingly he concludes his discussion with
Ilegative assessment performed gesturruly as a brushing aside gesture.

306 Cornelia Millier andAlan Cienki
The first three gestures the speaker uses relate to the propositional content of the utterance; G 1, G2, and G3 point to three different places in the imagined apartment, localizing three different persons with three different wishes. The ' brushing aside gesture (G4) is located in a micro-pause at the end of this, utterance - and clearly assesses this imagined situation as an undesirable one. There is no verbalization of a negative assessment; the gesture takes over the entire communicative burden. It is noteworthy that the gesture is " placed at the end of the phrasal unit, precisely where a verbal evaluative particle could have been placed. Instead the speaker pauses and produces a gesture with similar content. It seems as if the brushing aside gesture would do the, "same job" as a verbal particle would (which is why Miiller and, SpeckmallTI, suggested the term "gestural particle"). It gives a negative evaluation of a situation being described, and the gestural meaning is der-ive:d" from the negative connotation of the practical action. (For a detailed cogni-' tive semiotic analysis of this process, see TeBendorf in prep. a, b.)
What the brushing aside gesture shares with the other recurrent gestures ' , mentioned before is that it has a performative or (more general function rather than a referential one, and it is obvious that metaphor plays different role here than in example2. In the second example the cOlnrrlunica';;
tive function is metaphorical reference, whereas in example 3 the ge�;tulres";:
fWlction is the performance of a communicative action. Hence the first of the metaphoric gestures belongs to the realm of semantics while the one belongs to pragmatics. The difference is not a simple matter, but for sake of brevity it might be characterized as a difference between 2:es'ture:si, contributing information to the propositional content of the utterance
ru:!ii gestures contributing meta-communicative information. While in the sec:o
example the metaphoric gestures expressed aspects of the propositional tent (honesty as a physical form and movement) in the third example metaphoric gestures are used for meta-communicative purposes (they the propositional content), telling us how the propositional content choice of various programs) is being assessed by the speaker. Thus metaphor as well as metonymy are clearly involved in these gestures, come in at the level of the semiotic process of sign formation rather than the level of communicative function.
We may conclude that monomodal metaphors are frequent in words they also can be found in gestures. As for gestural metaphoric eXI)re�;sic)ru
l� we have found two different kinds: on the one hand there seem to be ges,tur
that are more likely to be created on the spot (such as example 2, with a "straight" gesture), and others that appear to recur with a rei'ltlv'elV
stable form and function (the "brushing aside" case, example 3). These

Words. gestures. and beyond 307
kinds of gestural metaphors furthermore seem to fall into two different func­ tional groups: one of them expressing parts of the propositional content, the other one performing meta-communicative acts in the widest sense. It seems that the latter ones show a tendency for conventionalization, which is why we are able to put together repertoires of those forms but not of the sponta­ neous referential gestures, created ad hoc.

4. Multimodal metaphors: source and target in two modalities
Turning to multimodal metaphor, it is not only interesting to note that once again we encounter quite some variation with regard to which articulatory mode expresses which aspects of the metaphor. The kind of variation and distribution of "duties" over the two modalities involved tell us something about the nature of the collaboration of words and gestures in spoken lan­ guage, and it offers insights into the cognitive activation of metaphoricity , during speaking. Of the three theoretically possible variations, two are com­ mon, whereas one is extremely rare. We find that the same source and target in two modalities, as well as different source and same target in two modali­ " ties, are very common forms of muhimodal metaphors in words and ges­ tures, whereas same source and different target appears to be rare.

4, I Same source and same target in two modalities

A very common form of gesture word collaboration in expressing metaphor 'is, as one might expect, when the source domain of a conceptual metaphor , appears simultaneously in both verbal and gestural form. Consider example
4, in which a young woman is describing how her teenage love became more
", and more clingy ("klebrig') and intense ("heftig'):

Ex:ample4: Gl open palms touching each other repeatedly
a/so da hab ich schon gemerkt naja'
So there I had already realized, well,

Here "clingyness" is being expressed verbally and gesturally. The sp(�er'!i," flat bands repeatedly touch each other, moving apart and then back to "stick-,

them. The gesture enacts the source domain of the verbal metaphoric expres:­

sion, indicating that metaphoricity of this expression was activated or in

foreground of the speaker's attention. However, the semantic

expressiveness that we observe in this example does not imply that the ges­

tural and the verbal parts of such a multimodal metaphor must also be eX-,' '

pressed simultaneously in real time. As is widely known from gesture stud­

ies, gestures they are held

often precede up and "waif'

words they are co-expressive for speecb, and sometimes they

expression. This is precisely what happens bere. Tbe gestural metaphor en­

acting clingyness begins with the fIrst line in the transcript. "Well I already'

realized" and it is held through the pause in the third line and recycled while

she offers another metaphoric qualification of the relation ("strong, in­

tense''). Put differently, even before the speaker actually verbalizes the: metaphoric expression "clingy" she begins to enact "clingyness" gesturally,' ' sTcoabnuitsrlcyiesbdaeofcmoaraesienthooeffvaethrvbeearvbl eopr-abgraetlsotmufretahtalepmm heoetratiapcphheoxorrpirniesswusithoteincr,bedbt.uhItenigtfeadsctotuertseheseonascitgsntihfie-"' ,'

overlap of the verbo-gestural metaphor is surrounded by an ongoing gesturaL

enactment of the metaphor. Put differently, gestures may dynamically

shadow and maintain verbal metaphors over longer stretcbes of discourse,

Moreover, tlley indicate activation of metaphoricity of conventional and
transparent metaphors (Muller 2003, 2007, 2008). Gestures expressing the'

source domain of a verbal metaphoric expression therefore indicate that at,,'

another, similar example below.2

In Example 5 a young man challenges his co-participant's opinion on the"

future implications of one' s first job after graduating from university. He

thinks that the fIrst job one takes on determines the path of one's future ca- ,

reer, and in order to make his point he uses a German idiomatic expression

"die Weichen stellen," literally "setting the tracks." Note that when he is:'

Words, gestures, and beyond 309
using this idiom for the first time, he does not gesture. Gesturing begins with his elaboration and illustration of this metaphoric argument,
Example 5: nein es is nich so,
no this is not the case,
aber es stellt natiirlich Weichen.
but it obviously sets tracks.
das is das Problem.
this is the problem.
Gl, 2 joined flat hand point towards left
es is schon ne Weiche-
it does set tracks
The speaker begins to develop his alternative viewpoint Witll a very common
rhetorical pattern in German conversations, the "nein aber" ("no but") pat­
tern, in which a preceding suggestion is first confirmed and then challenged. The confirmation in oUf example is verbalized in the fIrst line: "no, this is not the case," hereby confirming his interlocutor's point of view, which is tI,en followed by the counterargument in line two, beginning with "but": "but it obviously sets tracks." He verbally formulates his alternative viewpoint, and he does this metaphorically: "it obviously sets the tracks." No gesture is produced along with this first formulation of his counterargument; he only begins to gesture with his first reformulation of the verbal metaphoric ex­ pression. Having had no ratifying reaction from his co-participant he begins to elaborate his argument. And with this elaboration he performs a pointing gesture towards his left. Note that the pointing gesture is one in which the extended palms, held vertically, are used to indicate a certain direction. Note that there is a systematic variation of form and function in pointing gestures.
Kendon and Versante (2003) show that in Neapolitan conversations speakers
use the index fmger to point out objects, whereas the flat hand is used to indicate directions. In our case the vertical open palms of the two hands are joined to indicate one direction of a future career. In short, we see here an­ other example of a source being expressed in words and in gestures; the goal of a track is to lead the train into a certain direction, and the gesture visual­ izes and spatializes tI,is aspect of directionality of the source: gesturally the future career is located to the left hand side of the speaker. That this pointing gesture is a metaphoric one only becomes clear when considering the words with which it is co-expressive, and these entail a verbal metaphoric expres-

sion "Weiche" ("tracks"). Words and gestures share source and target of a metaphoric expression, and these cases are what MUller (2008) terms
"verbo-gestural metaphors" (cf. Forceville's 1996, 2002 concept of verba­
pictorial metaphors).

4.2 Different source and same target in two modalities

Here we encounter two different types of multimodal metaphor: one in which

there is a gestural metaphoric expression with a target that is verbalized in a

non-me�phorical fashion, and expressIOn goes along with a

vaenrobtahlermoentaephinorwichiecxhpraesgseisotnu.raTl hmusetainphboortihc.:

cases t?e target is sh�ed, but only in one case is it metaphorically conceptu- .

ahzed m both modahtl�s. We begin with an example in which the target of the gestural metaphonc expression is verbalized non-metaphorically. The

example comes from conversations between American students in which they

discussed honesty as a moral value in the context of taking exams, and the

student describes honesty as a kind of "abstract thought."

Example 6: y'know,

01
bh in front of chest, palms fucing self; fingers curled
a- as far as an abstract thought ofhonesty is,

As soon as the speaker says "far" she lifts her two hands up and places next to e�ch other with the palms of her hands basically facing herself, turned shghtly towards each other. Both bands are cupped, with the tml,el1L tense and curled inward balfway towards the palms. The shape is as if hands were surrounding a medimn-sized ball that she were squeezing. ""'P."\o that she holds her hands in this position for the entire phrase "abstract\' thought of honesty is" (making rhythmic beats on the syllables "far," stract," and 'hon-") we argue that this is a way in which she physically acterizes this "abstract thought" in gesture. We therefore find the mfmtl)hclriqj target domain in her words and the source domain (a solid form like that round object) in the gesture. Note that there is no metaphoric expressi�n the verbal level.

We sometimes tered at the same

see verbal and gestural metaphoric expressions time, each using a different source to express

bein"" the

target. In example 7 there is a color metaphor expressed verbally with '

Words, gestures, and beyond 311

spatial metaphor expressed gesturally (see also the discussion of this exam­ ple in Cienki 2008, and Cienki and MUller 2008b). Here the speaker from
Example 6 above continues the thought which was begun there describing
honesty as something that does not bave "gradations": instead it is character­ ized by clear oppositions: right or wrong, black or white.
Example 7:
I mean�­ y'know,

y'know,
G1 bh in front of chest, palms facing self, fingers curled
a- as far as an abstract thought ofhonesty is, y'know,

02 bh palms together, flat in horizontal plane, Ih palm up, rh sweeps left to right across palm of lh

03 Ih flat and palm up, rh flat,

alternating slightly to the left (L) and to the right (R)

Eitheryou're rightyou're wrong y 'r black 'r white y'know.

While verbally describing these oppositions (03), she moves her left hand
out in front of her, palm up and open. She holds her right hand above it, flat, with the palm held vertically, and taps the right edge of her palm against her ,'. open left hand in time with the speech as she says each of the words "right," "wrong," "black," and "white." Her right hand taps the left hand first slightly on the left side of her palm (while saying "right"), then slightly to the right side (while saying "wrong"), and repeats these left and right taps when saying "black" and "white," respectively. In one sense the gesture appears to
the dividing line, separating the space on the palm of her left hand into two parts (left and right spaces); but at the same time it indicates those very , spaces, the left and right sides of the palm of her hand, by tapping them. , ,whereas the gesture indicates each member of the two sets of opposing cate­
as two spaces, the words invoke an opposition between black and '·''''m,e. While colors (or tl1e lack of them) would be difficult to represent in an

312 Cornelia Millier and Alan Cienki
iconic way with gestures, spatial concepts are easily rendered, and conse-' quently the metaphor used in gesture (different spaces) is different than one used in words (different colors). We see here how the specific character­ istics of the expressive modality may inform the type of metaphors pressed, leading in this case to multimodal metaphoric expressions that different sources but share the same metaphoric target (different categ()fifls,' of behavior). These expressions might be tentatively termed "v(�rbo-��esltunll< metaphoric compounds." They differ from verbo-gestural metaphors \'U'UH,O and target are shared) in that they work together in expressing the same get metaphorically but do so with different means, i.e., by using different'''' sources.
4.3 Same source and different target in two modalities
It is interesting to note that, although theoretically possible, this variant not appear to be used at all - at least insofar as our sets of data are cemed., One could picture a situation where somebody talks about bnlshing�; off crumbs of potato chips (crisps) from one's sweater while doing a dislmis.,\; sive brushing aside gesture, characterizing this as a negative aspect of ealtinl�'.: potato chips.3 Cases like these seem to be extremely rare. What we do instead is that the gestures appear to have a tendency to "follow" the seraanl-,' tics and pragmatics of the verbal utterance, if they can (i.e., if the veI'ba,lized,# content is "gesturable," recall the color metaphor example). It seems, fore, that when the source is shared the target is also shared. This is theoreti{t
� cally interesting because it puts the source information rendered ge�;turall
into a specific light. We will return to this highlighting of source in£omlatiionT through gestures later.
4.4 Discussion
If we consider the examples of metaphoric expression in gesture, de5icri,bei above, we find certain aspects which are qualitatively different than what see in metaphoric expression in words. First, words are part of the sytnblJl\C system of a language. We generally accept that individual words and phrases they comprise have ascertainable meanings motivating their While within a given culture there may be recurring fOffils which many tures take, or certain parameters that they share, most gestures do not highly codified sytnbolic fOffil-meaning pairings. (The well-known tions are the "emblem" gestures which can substitute for words, such as

Words, gestures, and beyond 313
thumbs-up gesture used as a positive response to something, at least in many European cultures.) In this way they contrast with the manually produced signs of a signed language. Because of the spontaneously determined fonn, placement, and duration of their use, and obviously because they consist of physical fOffils and movements in space, we find they have properties when serving as expressions of metaphor source domains which are different from those of words expressing metaphoric source domains.
In addition, it is well known that many gestures present abstract ideas, which are being mentioned in the speech, as concrete entities in front of the speaker: the gestures indicate particular spaces and locations for the idea, or the hands appear to hold an idea, as if it were an object. But this reification
is not a simple reification of ABSTRACT AS CONCRETE (what Lakoff and
Johnson 1980 called ontological metaphors). The gestures also show us cer­ tain properties of the objectified ideas or topics - their size, relative location as imagined by the speaker in the space before himlher, perhaps even their metaphorical evaluation as good or bad by their placement in a high or low space (respectively). For example, in Example 6 when the speaker says "ab­ stract thought of honesty," she holds her two hands out in front of her, the " pinkie-finger sides next to each other with her pahns facing herself, the hands half curled in a tense position, as if the hands were cupping and hold­ ing an object about the size of a grapefruit. Here the "abstract thought" is shown to be something quite concrete, discrete, and of a size comparable to that of objects we manipulate with our hands every day. As this description shows, tidy characterization of these metaphors for research purposes is prclblematic, particularly when using a theory like Conceptual Metaphor
" Theory, in which the formula X IS Y (e.g., GOOD IS up) is the standard way
, of analyzing metaphoric mappings. We will return to this dilen1faif towards , the end of the chapter. In addition, we find that metaphors do not necessarily , occur as single units, but they can also extend over time, and can add up to
complex structures, and as this volume demonstrates they may appear in a broad range of media and modes among them fihn, photography, painting, and sculpture (Forceville 2006; Gilo.t and Lake 1964; Mittelberg 2002;
,;lV""H�l 2007).
The dynamic nature of metaphoric expressions in the flow of discourse
i(w!et1lphors can be successively elaborated and specified. This holds for hrlonorrLodal verbal metaphors as well as for multimodal metaphors realized

314 Cornelia Muller and Alan Cienki
in spoken language as well as for those instantiated in other media, such as for instance film or cartoons (Forceville 1999, 2005, 2006; MUller 2007, 2008).
Example 8 is a continuation of Example 5 and it shows such a successive multimodal elaboration of a verbal metaphoric expression. In this example the co-participants are discussing their differing viewpoints regarding the future implications of one's first job after graduating from university. The current speaker rejects his co-participant's position and argues for the im­ portant consequences that the first job may have for the path of one's future career. Recall that he uses a German idiomatic expression "die Weichen stellen," literally, "setting the tracks," when expressing his point verbally. He only begins to gesture as he offers a succession of examples which illus­ trate and elaborate his understanding of "setting the tracks" by choosing a specific job after graduation.
Example 8: nein es is nich so, no this is not the case,
aber es stelit nati1rlich Weichen. but it obviously sets tracks.
das is das Problem.
this is the problem.
Gl 2 joined flat hand point towards left

G3 flat hands point upward

G7 1 flat hand points forward twice, held through pause
nachm Studium mujJle dir wirklieh aberlegen welehe-(...)
after graduating [from university] you really have to think carefully
which...

In the first part of his response he expresses his alternative viewpoint with a verbal metaphoric expression: "it does set tracks." We see no gesture going with this first formulation; rather this counterargument is highlighted ver­ bally through a meta-comment: "this is the problem." These first verbal moves set the stage for a sequence of verbal illustrations and gestural enact­ ments of the verbal metaphoric expression. Subsequently the verbally ex­ pressed metaphoric concept of "setting the tracks" is illustrated by listing three job alternatives - medicine, agriculture, tennis - each one bemg gestur­ ally situated in a different direction: medicine is the path to the left, agricul­ ture to the right, and tennis is located in the upward direction. The gestures visualize the source of the metaphoric expression "setting the tracks," they embody directionality, and they locate the different future career paths in three alternative directions in the gesture space (left, right, up). But this is not the end of the speaker's argument. After verbalizing three alternatives and enacting three different directions for three different jobs, he sumam rizes and comes back to tlle verbal metaphoric expression that he had used ini­ tially: "this is a kind of setting the tracks"; once again this verbal metaphoric is not accompanied by a gesture. By returning to his initial expression he retrospectively frames his verOO-gestural elaborations as examples for the metaphoric expression he had used to challenge his co-participant's argu­ ment while at the same time preparing his last and now fully explicit re­ formulation of his counter-argument: "after graduating you really have to think carefully which-- ( ...)." This last re-formulation ends with a gestural expression of the idiom that replaces the words and is inserted into the

3 1 6 Cornelia Muller and A/an Cienki

speech-pause. He uses yet another pointing gesture, but this one is per- ;' formed with one hand only and it is directed forward - a direction which has ' not yet been "occupied" by any of his preceding examples. Moreover the gesture is highly articulated in shape: it is supported by the left hand, di- ' rected towards the recipient, repeated twice, and held through the speech . pause at the end of the tum; and with this gesture the counter-argument and the tum end.

To sum up, in this segment of talk we find a verbal metaphoric expres- .

sion at the onset which is further verbally illustrated with concrete examples, ' enacted and elaborated in gestural metaphoric expressions, and completed

with a final gestural metaphoric expression at the end of this counterargu- .

ment. This example nicely illustrates that metaphoricity is a dynamic fea.tute

which may trigger metaphoric elaborations in multiple modalities succes- ' sively in time, and which may provide grounds for the ad hoc creation of :

new metaphoric gestures, doing "different jobs." We may argue that when the verbal metaphoric expression was uttered first, metaphoricity was not in

'.

the foreground of the speaker's attention; we find no indication that meta­

phoricity was particularly active for the speaker at that point in time. Put

differently, at this moment the metaphor was sleeping; only as the speaker is

moving on is he building his elaborations in words and gestures on this

sleeping metaphoric expression, thus using it as source. Doing this makes

clear that metaphoricity becomes successively more active, as he moves ' along with his argument, such that we may now speak ofwaking metaphors. .

Formulated in McNeill's terms, what we may find here is a metaphorical ';'

growth point that structures a whole unit of discourse (McNeill 1 992; McNeill and Duncan 2000).4 For conceptual metaphor theory tins raises

questions about how to account for metaphoricity as a dynamic nr()ne,rtv

which can be more or less highlighted (Miiller 2008). Again, the formula

TARGET IS SOURCE problematically reifies the two domains as static entities.

6. Metaphors beyond words and gestnres But there is more to multimodal metaphor in spoken language use tI,an ' words and gestures. Let us return to the various expressive forms involved the oraVaural modality. The metaphoric possibilities of prosodic eX1Jressi,on have received less attention in the literature. However, some of the exi:stlllg ' research on prosody (e.g., Pierrehumbert and Hirschberg 1 990) may be rein- :' terpreted in terms of revealing the potential of intonation for metaphoric significance. As an example, we can take Pierrehumbert and Hu:sc!lbelrg's

Words, gestures, and beyond 3 1 7
discussion of a well-known role played by intonation in speech, that of ex­ pression on the metanarrative level. Thus the speaker's belief about whether or not slhe shares information mutually with the hearer may be expressed metaphorically via low or high pitch accents, respectively. Looking at these findings from the perspective of metaphor studies, might they ultimately be grounded in the metaphorical patterns of reasoning (known since Lakoff and Johnson 1980) concerning what is KNOWN AS DOWN and what is UNKNOWN AS up? (In fact these themselves are secondary metaphors based on our Western metaphorical understanding of pitch along a vertical scale, but we will not dwell on that here.)
Other research shows a connection between the lexical semantics of words rated as positive or negative, and the relative pitch with which they were produced in experimental settings, correlating with tile metaphors GOOD IS UP and BAD IS DOWN. For example, Herold (2006) found in her
study that words with positively rated meanings (like happy and yummy
["tasty"]) were produced with a higher fundanlental frequency (pitCh) tI,an
words with negatively rated meanings (like sad and weak).
In terms of metaphoric expression in speech which is independent of metaphoric verbal semantics, think of vocalizations that are not lexical , words and how their interpretation can differ by the intonation with which " they are uttered. In response to a question about whether someone likes something or not, one (at least an American English speaker) Can utter "Mmm" starting with a high pitch accent, and then letting the pitch fal� to indicate a positive reply. But one could also say "Mm"m with a level low tone, which could indicate a negative reaction, or at least non-confirmational uncertainty. Thus perhaps metaphorical mappings such as POSITNE IS UP and NEGATNE IS DOWN may appear in the use of intonation, even without accompanying words that have corresponding lexical meanings.
One study (Cienki in prep.) provides some evidence about the degree to which individuals interpret the quality of prosodic features (stress and into­ nation contours) in metaphoric terms. The study involved having 20 partici­ pants categorize a series of phrases which they sUllultaneously heard and read using a set of "image schemas" as descriptors. The term "image sche­ mas" is being used here in the sense of Johnson (1 987) to refer to simple patterns which frequently recur in various aspects of people's everyday ex­ perience (especially visual, tactile, and force-dynanric experience). The set of image-schema names from which participants could choose was limited to the following: container, cycle, force, object, and patll, plus the alternative of "other." For comparison in this study, another 20 participants performed the same task of having to characterize the same phrases using the given set of

3 1 8 Cornelia Muller and Alan Cienki
image schema names, but this second group only read the phrases and not hear the recordings of the speakers' voices uttering them. The expen,. . ments were actually conducted as controls for another experimental setting in which the participants saw and heard the video clips in which the speakers : " uttered these phrases and made co-verbal gestures (Cienki 2005a). Since the utterances were chosen because they were ones which occurred with gestures ' of various kinds, the words and phrases themselves were rather random, :, ranging from more substantive ones, such as "their tests are difficult" and· "it's like you're performing," to comments and interjections, such as not really" and "like."
After completing the categorization task, the participants in the group were asked to write a sentence or two explaining how they used image schemas to categorize the phrases they heard. The results re,realed,' that they sometimes categorized some of the phrases according to their ., acoustic properties, rather than referring to the meanings of the lexical items. Consider the following response as an example: "a phrase where the tone rose and fell back again seemed cyclical, whereas when the tone steadily it seemed like a path." We see how metaphor may play a role in intefj:lreting, : how an utterance was spoken. As a side note, this could be important metaphor researchers in terms of setting up stimuli for experiments on meta. phor interpretation. The fmdings underscore the importance of coJlsi(iering the mode of presentation of experimental stimuli (in oral versus form) because of the effect it may have on the interpretation of the "same" , linguistic expressions.
It is worth noting with these examples of metaphor in intonation that we ·' are not dealing with verbal semantics, but with metaphor on the pnigrnatic level - what the speaker meant with the use of a given intonation COIltOIIlI".' Interestingly, we fmd a paralIel phenomenon of metaphor on the pragmatic; , level in gesture. The primary function of some gestures appears to be ' highlight interactive or interpersonal relations, to parse the discourse, or accomplish a performative act (Kendon 2004: ch. 9). MulIer, referring unpublished observations by Jurgen Streeck, discusses the pragmatic funO" tions of the pahn-up open-hand (PUOH) gesture, which can serve to "pre,. sent an abstract, discursive object as a concrete, manipulable entity" (2004: 233). The gesture can indicate that what the speaker is saying is to be preted as an idea to be discussed, a proposal, or a question (Kendon 2004: :
1 59). In terms of conceptual metaphor theory, we might say that this gestur�
uses the pragmatic metaphor of INTRODUCING AN IDEA IS PRESENTING AN OBJECT. Here as in the other recurrent gestures discnssed above, the phor does not simply work on the level of what the speaker's words eX�lress

Words, gestures, and beyond 3 19
semanticalIy. Rather, it works on the pragmatic level, in that the source is expressed in the gesture, and the target is what the speaker is doing with his/her words as well as with his/her gestures.

7. Implications for metaphor theory

A major conclusion we can draw from the fact that metaphors can be real­

ized in multiple modalities is that metaphoricity is modality-independent. It

documents that the establishment and creation of metaphoricity is a cognitive

process with products in various modalities, thus offering strong support for

Lakoff and Johnson's initial idea of moving metaphor(icity) out of the reahn

of literary discourse into the mundane world of everyday thought (Muller

2003, 2007, 2008). However, this also has critical implications for metaphor

theory in that it calls for refuled empirical methodology as well as for a new

theoretical understanding of the different forms of multimodal metaphors and

, their constitutive semantic relations. It also directs our attention to the neces­

sity of including a cognitive-semiotic analysis of metaphoric, as well as of

metonymic, processes (see Mittelberg 2006, 2007; Mittelberg and Muller in

I prep. a; Mittelberg and Waugh this volume). A major implication of the insights gained through the analysis of multimodal metaphors in the use of

spoken language is the fact that as spoken language is inherently dynamic, so

is multimodal metaphor.

As already indicated above, the study of metaphors as expressed in the

: dynamic processes of speaking presents us with metaphoric source domains

,. which are themselves contingent on time for their realization. This raises a

: problem, given the traditional means of conceptual metaphor analysis,

, namely that it involves the static verbal formula of TARGET IS SOURCE (an

: issue raised long ago by the anthropologist Bradd Shore, personal communi­

:' c:ation:). Various authors in recent research have suggested alternatives to try

, .to overcome the limitations ofthis analytic device.

For some types of source domains, one solution is to characterize them

using schematic images. An example described in Cienki (2005b) is that

when Al Gore was a candidate for U.S. president in 2000 he used the same

; gesture at several points during the televised debates: a gesture with one or

, both hands palm up and cupped slightly with the fmgers slightly curved, as if

, he were holding a smalI ball. This gesture occurred with phrases such as

: , '''enable us to project the power for good," "shepherds that economic

' "

"

strength," "the power of example is America's world" (with square brackets indicating the timing

[greatest power] in of the gesture in the

the last

320 Cornelia Muller and Alan Cienki
example). We would argue that in the examples from Gore, the gesture · "•. serves basically the same purpose as the PUOH gesture discussed by Muller (2004), but that there is an added element here indicated by the cupped shape of the hand. In a physical situation, such a hand shape would be used not only to support a small object in the hand, but also to prevent it from falling off the extended hand, thus protecting it in a way. Thus the gesture not only suggests that the speaker is treating AN IDEA AS AN OBJECT, which he is presenting to the addressee (the moderator of the debate and, by extension, the television audience), but that he is also showing something about his attitude toward the idea he is presenting, perhaps that it is something good which he wants to support (all three utterances expressed positive ideas which Gore espoused). In light of the meaning added by the cupped hand . shape, the marmer of presenting is significant, and (as argued in Cienki 2005b) could be indicated by a diagram or schematic image - see the ones Efron (1972) used in his analysis of the linguistic properties of the gestures used by Italians as compared to Eastern-European Jewish immigrants to New York City. See also Calbris' (2003) schematizations of gesture hand shapes and motions in diagrammatic form. Finally, the increasing use of digital publishing (online or on CDs or DVDs) allows for video characteriza­ tion of source domains which are dYnamic in nature, in that they can be pre' sented as moving schematic images, for example as small animations.
8. Implications for thinking for speaking and gesturing
Siobin (1987, 1996) argues that there is a special form of thought which is mobilized in the process of talking, which he calls thinking-for-speaking. As he describes it, "'Thinking for speaking' involves picking those characteris, tics [of a perceived event, CM and AC] that (a) fit some conceptualization of . the event, and (b) are readily encodable in the language" which the speaker is using at the moment (Slobin 1987: 435). Thus the lexical and gralrnmaticaF ' means of expression available in a langnage are used by speakers already as they are anticipating how to utter what they want to utter. McNeill and Dun­ can (2000) suggest that gesture needs to be taken into account in this process as well. They discuss how the idea units which we are continually develop­ ing and unraveling for expression while we talk, what McNeill (1992) has called growth points, combine both imagery and linguistic-categorical con­ tent. In the process of thinking while speaking, which McNeill and Duncan (2000: 157) note is perhaps a more accurate way to refer to the phenomenon, . the imagistic content receives partial expression in the gestures that the

Words. gestures, and beyond 321
speaker produces. Indeed, which imagery is expressible in gesture is a factor in how the verbo-gestural ntterance is produced. Consequently we (Muller and Cienki 2006) have discussed the process as "thinking-for-speaking-and­ gesturing". Both the nature of the available linguistic forms as well as the expressive potential of hand-gestures which one can use in the expression of one's thoughts while speaking are significant for what thoughts ultimately get expressed. This means that there are important cormections between which single or multiple modality/ies are at one's disposal for expression and the kind(s) of metaphoric ideas which one ultimately conceptualizes and expresses - either monomodal\y or multimodally.
9. Conclusion
The insights gained through the analyses of multimodal metaphors in lan­ guage use have ratller far-reaching consequences for a theory of metaphor. Not only do they underline the stance of Conceptual Metaphor Theory with regard to the principally modality-independent nature of metaphoricity (this means metaphor as a cognitive mechanism); they uncover that the hitherto static view on metaphor in thought and language must be supplemented by a dynamic view on metaphor in thinking, speaking and gesturing (cf. Muller 2003, 2007, 2008; MulIer and Cienki 2006;). Such a dynamic view takes into consideration the procedural nature of meaning creation in situations of face-to-face communication, including the elaboration of metaphoric expres­ sions in the discourse as well as the dynamic activation of metaphoricity, which for a specific and often short moment in time may turn sleeping meta­ phors into waking ones (Muller 2003, 2007, 2008). Put differently, these observations indicate that we need a theory that distinguishes between prod­ ucts and processes (Gibbs 1992, 1998, 1999; cf. also Cameron and Low 1999), and also between system and use (Muller 2008; Steen 2006; Steen and Gibbs 1999) or one that cross-cuts these dichotomies as Steen (2007) has recently proposed; that one distinguishes metaphors in grammar and usage, be they approached as symbolic structure or as forms of behavior.
Further consequences of realizing the multimodal nature of metaphoric expression in the use of spoken language include that in co-speech gesturing as well as in prosodic features of speech we may see manifestations of the imagistic or, more generally, the embodied nature of many metaphoric source domains. We also see that the metaphoric process is not a unidirec­ tional one, one in which a preconfigured thought is being "translated" into gesture, word, or sound; rather we must conceive of it as an interactional

322 Cornelia Muller andAlan Cienki
process which takes into consideration the nature and the expressive poten- ,: tial of the respective modalities (colors do not lend themselves to expression in gesture, but for spatial relations the opposite holds true). Compare for instance what is known about metaphoric expression in another use of the manual modality, namely in sign language. In both cases, gesture and sign language, the iconic nature of visual/manual expression afof rds different .
potentials than aural/oral expression does (Miiller in prep.; Taub 2001), .
although gestures with speech are normally co-verba� as opposed to consti­ tuting linguistic signs in and of themselves. However, in the process of communication - or to put it in Wallace Chafe's (1994) terms, in the flow of discourse - these modality-specific properties can be exploited to varying . extents in any given event of speaking.
A dynamic approach to linguistic theory (such as that proposed by
McNeill 2005) or to metaphor theory (as in Miiller 2008) which can ac- .
commodate the multimodal potential of language productiou and reception can provide a more complete picture of the complexity of this form of human . behavior than the static views of language, metaphor, and thought which · currently dominate the field of cognitive linguistics and beyond. In conclu­ sion, for researchers of spoken language, moving beyond the level of the • words can uncover many facets of metaphoricity that had previously lain hidden.

that facing formations may actually show different forms, varying with the :
amount of participants involved but also within dyadic encounters: "In F-:
formations of two indidviduals, for example, we may see arrangements vary from a direct face-to-face pattern, to an L-shaped pattern, or even a side- . by-side pattern" (Kendon 1990: 250). Kendon (personal communication) has : . also observed that Australian aboriginals conduct conversations in certain·· situations all facing the same direction, i.e., in a side-by-side configuration. Tzeltal speakers appear to quite commonly choose a side-by-side configura-: tion in dyadic situations (Stephen Levinson, personal communication). For

This example is inspired by a case reported by TeBendorf, in which the brushing aside movement is used to brush aside crumbs ofpotato chips, func­ tioning here as an object manipulation.

Abstract
Based on spoken academic discourse and its accompanying gestures, this chapter presents a cognitive-semiotic approach to multimodal communication that assigns equal importance to metaphor and metonymy. Combining traditional semiotics with contemporary cognitivist theories, we demonstrate how these two figures of thought jointly structure multimodal representations of grammatical concepts and structures. We discuss Jakobson's view of metaphor and metonymy, and particu­ larly his distinction between internal and external metonymy, thus discerning various principles of sign constitution and indirect reference within metaphoric gestures (whether or not the concurrent speech is metaphorical). We then intro­ duce a dynamic two-step interpretative model suggesting that metonymy leads the way into metaphor: in order to infer the imaginary objects or traces that gesturing hands seem to hold or draw in the air, a metonymic mapping between hand (source) and imaginary object (target) is a prerequisite for the metaphorical map­ ping between that very object (source) and the abstract idea (target) it represents.
Keywords: metaphor, metonymy, gesture, semiotics, cognitive theory
1. Introduction
Work done by scholars in many disciplines has shown that metaphor and metonymy rely on general cognitive processes of conceptualization and asso­ ciation that may materialize in modalities other than spoken and written 'words, e.g., in gesture. While the chapters in this volume contribute to a . unified approach to the role of metaphor in multimodal representations, we will show here that it is both metaphor and metonymy that, by working to­ . 6.�'U�' in multimodal communication, function to convey complex meanings,
