1. Introduction
................................................................................................ .................................................
A fundamental principle in Cognitive Linguistics is that semantics is, indeed, primarily cognitive and not a matter of relationships between language and the world (or truth conditions with respect to a model). This principle becomes especially manifest in the research into facets of meaning and grammatical organization which crucially makes use of notions such as ‘‘perspective,’’ ‘‘subjectivity,’’ or ‘‘point of view.’’ What these notions have in common is that they capture aspects of conceptualization that cannot be sufﬁciently analyzed in terms of properties of the object of conceptualization, but, in one way or another, necessarily involve a subject of conceptualization. A strong incentive for this type of research stems from the awareness that the more linguistic problems can be solved by making use of these notions, the more (heuristically) successful the fundamental principle is; in addition, this research is motivated by the awareness that the best way to make these notions relevant for linguistic analysis is not given a priori and thus requires empirical investigation. It is therefore not surprising that there is in fact quite a large body of research into such nonobjective facets of linguistic meaning.
The cover term that has come to be used for different ways of viewing a particular situation is ‘‘construal.’’ At a very elementary level, construal is a feature of the meaning of all linguistic expressions, if only as a consequence of the fact that languages provide various ways for categorizing situations, their participants

and features, and the relations between them. Speaking thus always implies a choice:
A speaker who accurately observes the spatial distribution of certain stars can describe them in many distinct fashions: as a constellation, as a cluster of stars, as specks of light in the sky, etc. Such expressions are semantically distinct; they reﬂect the speaker’s alternate construals of the scene, each compatible with its objectively given properties. (Langacker 1990a: 61)
The fact that a particular situation can be construed in alternate ways should, from a cognitive linguistic perspective, not come as a big surprise or require extensive justiﬁcation. What is more important linguistically is that languages systematically provide means for different kinds of construal. For instance, the distinct descriptions of a single phenomenon given in the quotation from Langacker above differ in (among other things) the frames of knowledge with respect to which the conceived situation is characterized: a particular distribution of stars is only considered a constellation in a culturally shared traditional frame of knowledge about the structure of the sky, while this framework is not required for conceptualizing it as a cluster. So one type of construal involved in these examples crucially involves frames of knowledge (or ‘‘Idealized Cognitive Models’’). Another type, also involved here, focuses on the compositionality of the conceptualization: both a cluster of stars and specks of light in the sky evoke their objects of conceptualization by combining several elements into a whole in some particular way, while the lexical item constellation does not. Then again, specks of light in the sky (with the plural noun specks as its head) focuses on the multiplicity of the phenomenon observed, whereas constellation and a cluster of stars impose the construal of a coherent unit (with the cluster constituting a ‘‘multiplex’’ one in the sense of Talmy 2000a: 59).
This simple example already shows that there are several dimensions along which construals may vary. Cognitive linguists, most notably Langacker and Talmy, have proposed a number of classiﬁcation schemes for construal phenomena, in attempts to organize them into a relatively small number of basic types. However, these classiﬁcatory systems seem to exhibit a substantial amount of arbitrariness. This is partly due to the fact that research into construal phenomena, while ubiquitous in ordinary language and therefore highly important, has at the same time led to a large increase in the number of known distinct construal operations. Therefore, it is useful to consider a few more types of construal before considering the classiﬁcation proposals. It should be evident, though, that this cannot be a comprehensive list of construal phenomena.

2. The Diversity of Construal
Phenomena
................................................................................................ .................................................
One of the ﬁrst construal operations to have been recognized as linguistically highly relevant is the ‘‘Figure/Ground’’ distinction, well known from studies in Gestalt psychology. It was introduced into Cognitive Linguistics (even before it was known under that name) through the work of Talmy (1978). In visual perception, one element may be the focus of attention—the ‘‘Figure’’; it is perceived as a prominent coherent element and set off against the rest of what is in the ﬁeld of vision—the ‘‘Ground.’’ This psychological distinction is reﬂected in many linguistic distinctions, lexical as well as grammatical. Consider, for instance, the expressions X is above Y and Y is below X; while these expressions denote the same spatial conﬁguration, they are semantically distinct in that they reﬂect different selections of the participant that is to provide the Ground, with respect to which the other participant, as Figure can be located. A well-known example of a grammatical alternation in which the construal of a participant as either Figure or Ground constitutes part of the semantic difference is the active/passive contrast.
The meanings of lexical items quite generally include a subtype of this Figure/ Ground construal. Consider the meaning of the word uncle, which presupposes a background network of kinship relations, and foregrounds one particular node in it. More generally, a lexical item usually designates, or ‘‘proﬁles’’ (in Langacker’s terminology), a substructure within a larger structure (the ‘‘base’’), and knowing what larger structure is involved is part of knowing the meaning of that item. The words ﬁnger and thumb, while proﬁling different substructures, share the conception of a hand as their base; the same holds for ceiling and ﬂoor with respect to a room, and so on. A general linguistic reﬂex of this phenomenon is found in constraints on expressions denoting part-whole relationships; these may not ‘‘bypass’’ base-proﬁle relations. While The hand of this animal has three ﬁngers is felicitous, ?The arm of this animal has three ﬁngers is deﬁnitely awkward, and This animal has three ﬁngers has an entirely different meaning.
Proﬁle-base distinctions also exist in the domain of time. The ﬂow of time constitutes (part of) the base of the meaning of verbs. Different lexical verbs may proﬁle different ‘‘slices’’ of time, backgrounding and foregrounding different features (thus producing different ‘‘aspectual’’ proﬁles). For example, think and read present processes that are construed as ongoing, not involving a change in the period of time being focused on, while arrive and promise present processes that crucially involve a change at the time being focused on. Grammatical constructions may impose a particular kind of proﬁle on the temporal interpretation of a situation. For example, the English progressive construction (be þ V-ing) can be said to impose a particular proﬁle on the interpretation of the clause, backgrounding any boundaries (beginning and end point) of the designated process, irrespective of the meaning of the verb (see also Michaelis 2004; Boogaart and Janssen, this volume, chapter 31).

construal and perspectivization 51
Another important construal operation is based on the fact that objects and situations can be perceived at different levels of ‘‘resolution,’’ or ‘‘granularity.’’ One linguistic correlate of this cognitive feature is the fact that lexical categories may form taxonomic hierarchies consisting of various levels of speciﬁcity (e.g., Palomino, horse, mammal, animal, living thing, thing). Each of these levels corresponds to our perception of things at different degrees of granularity. This in itself already allows language users to describe events at different levels of speciﬁcity (or, conversely, schematicity). Some of the most common verbs in a language are highly schematic (e.g., English be, have, do, and make), allowing a speaker to characterize a situation without paying attention to all the details of the speciﬁc state or process involved. Thus, the same objective situation can be described as The young physicist wrote an original book, The physicist wrote a book, The scientist produced a publication, The woman made something, or She made something. Often, the role of verbs in a construction is to provide speciﬁcs to the schematic conceptualization evoked by the construction. For example, They made their way through the forest, although itself a speciﬁc case of a transitive template, still evokes a rather schematic image of overcoming resistance and movement, while They cut their way through the forest provides more details about the means of ‘‘way-making.’’ The function of modiﬁers is to allow for representations with a high degree of speciﬁcity on the basis of (clausal and nominal) templates that are in themselves only rather schematic for types of events— that is, modiﬁers also make speciﬁcity possible without the need for more templates.
An example of grammatical construal involving different levels of granularity is provided by those causative constructions which code the causal and the result components of an event separately (e.g., English to make something happen). Such a construction construes an event with a higher degree of resolution than a causal lexical verb would; compare, for instance, to make someone believe something with to tell someone something. This, in turn, allows variation in explicit, highly granular construals of causal relationships, with distinctions such as those between to make someone believe something and to let someone believe something.
The construal phenomena discussed so far variously impose structure on conceptualizations in ways that do not immediately follow from their content, which is why they are considered cases of construal in the ﬁrst place. Another form of construal consists in understanding one conceptualization in relation to another one. For example, tense marking in a ﬁnite clause in English relates the situation mentioned in the clause to the conceptualization of the communicative situation (roughly, as overlapping or not), which is why the category of tense is considered ‘‘deictic’’—along with such elements as personal pronouns (with I and you identifying participants in the conceived situation as communicative participants and third-person pronouns identifying situation participants as not participating in the communicative process) and adverbs like here, now, there, and then. Other ways of understanding one conceptualization in relation to another are by establishing similarity or any sufﬁciently salient contingent connection—these two constitute the basis (albeit not exhaustively) for metaphor and metonymy, respectively—or by establishing contrast (e.g., negation) or scalarity (e.g., comparison).

Not only can construals of events be different within languages, but also across languages; that is, there exist typological distinctions in terms of construal—an issue related to the issue of linguistic relativity. For example, languages may not only have different means available to organize spatial relations, they may also differ radically in the way space is conceptually structured. In such cases, individual speakers have little or no freedom of choice to pick one construal over another, as their language simply lacks some of the ‘‘options.’’ Nevertheless, what is involved is still different construals of similar experiences or phenomena.
One type that has traditionally received much attention is the different ways motion events are expressed linguistically in languages such as English, on the one hand, and languages such as Spanish, on the other (see Talmy 2000b: 21–67, for a recent comprehensive overview). In English, the verb in a sentence expressing a motion event usually also encodes (features of) a ‘‘co-event,’’ such as manner (to slide, to roll, to bounce, etc.) or cause or instrument (to push, to blow, to chop, to pound, etc.), while the direction of movement may be indicated by optional adjuncts (into the water, etc.). In Spanish, on the other hand, the verb is mostly required to mark some aspect of directionality, and factors such as manner or instrument may be expressed by means of adjuncts ( . . . entro´ a la casa bailando ‘ . . . entered the house dancing’). Spanish, encoding the path component of motion in the verb, is called a ‘‘verb-framed language,’’ while English is called a ‘‘satellite-framed language.’’ Since verbs are obligatory elements in clauses expressing events, the two types of languages conventionally impose different construals on the conceptualization of motion events. It is ﬁndings of this type that have given rise to a research program, especially executed by Talmy, into the questions of what the typological variation in construal among languages is and what kind of factors are involved in it.
Another highly intriguing question triggered by this kind of typological results concerns the inﬂuence of conventional construal patterns in a language on the thought processes of its speakers (see Bowerman 1996; Levinson 2001). With respect to the distinction between satellite-framed and verb-framed languages in the domain of motion events, Slobin has developed his concept of ‘‘thinking for speaking’’; the idea is that the grammatical patterns of a native language force its learners to habitually pay attention to those features of events that are necessary for expression in linguistic communication (Slobin 1996)—this issue is developed further by Pederson in chapter 38 of the present Handbook.
In view of the multitude of possible construal operations and their diverse uses across languages—which has become apparent even from this brief overview—a number of interrelated questions can be raised. How are construal operations related to each other? Are there basic types of construal? Which construal relations share which properties? Can linguistic expressions be exhaustively characterized as belonging to certain types and not others? One additional consideration that gives rise to these questions is the fact that certain phenomena systematically seem to allow for more than one classiﬁcation. For example, the fact that a phenomenon allows for construal at different levels of speciﬁcity is at least to some

33625_u03_UNCORR_PRF.3d_53_05-29-07
construal and perspectivization 53
extent related to the fact that it can be seen as similar to other phenomena: the higher the schematicity, the more general the category to which it is assigned, and thus the larger the set of phenomena that are considered similar. Or consider the English progressive above, which was characterized in terms of proﬁling (backgrounding of the boundaries of a process unfolding in time); an alternative way of characterizing the progressive might be in terms of viewpoint: the position from which the situation is viewed is contained in the ongoing process itself (so that any boundaries are not ‘‘in view’’). Considerations like these also make the question which types of construal operations there are, and how they are connected, an urgent one. So let us now turn to the issue of classifying construal phenomena.
3. Classiﬁcations of
Construal Operations
................................................................................................ .................................................
Langacker (1987: 116–37) proposed the following threefold classiﬁcation of construal operations (then called ‘‘focal adjustments’’):
a. Selection b. Perspective c. Abstraction
The ﬁrst category concerns language users’ capacity to selectively attend to some facets of a conceptualization and ignoring others. The second comprises linguistic manifestations of the position from which a situation is viewed, and is divided into four subtypes: (i) Figure/Ground alignment, (ii) Viewpoint, (iii) Deixis, and (iv) Subjectivity/Objectivity. The third major category relates to our ability to establish commonalities between distinct phenomena and abstracting away from differences, and thus to organize concepts into categories. Langacker has since revised his classiﬁcation, which now1 looks as follows (see Langacker, this volume, chapter 17):
a. Speciﬁcity b. Prominence c. Perspective d. Dynamicity
The ﬁrst class (Speciﬁcity) roughly corresponds to the previous class Abstraction. The new category of Prominence comprises especially Figure/Ground phenomena and the phenomena formerly categorized under Selection. Perspective has remained the same, except that of the subtype Figure/Ground has now been placed in the Prominence category. Dynamicity is an additional category and concerns the development of a conceptualization through processing time (rather than through

conceived time). It is ﬁrst of all connected to the inherent temporal nature of linguistic utterances: presenting elements of a conceptualization in a different order results in differences of meaning. But a dynamic, sequential conceptualization may also result from the application of a dynamic concept to an object of conceptualization that is not inherently dynamic itself (as in The road winds through the valley).
Talmy (1988) originally proposed the following ‘‘imaging systems’’ as the major classes of construal phenomena:
a. Schematization b. Perspective c. Attention d. Force Dynamics
There is a considerable overlap between this proposal and the one by Langacker, which in itself is indicative of the relevance of these classes. Thus, Talmy’s Schematization largely corresponds to Langacker’s Speciﬁcity; both have a category Perspective comprising similar phenomena, and Talmy’s category Attention overlaps with Langacker’s Prominence. Force Dynamics, though, is absent from Langacker’s classiﬁcation.
Talmy (2000a: 40–84) has now also revised his classiﬁcation, yielding the following major categories:
a. Conﬁgurational Structure b. Perspective c. Distribution of Attention d. Force Dynamics2
Perpendicular to these four ‘‘schematic systems,’’ as they are now called, there is a ‘‘schematic category’’ called Domain, which includes only a very limited number of major dimensions of construal, namely, ‘‘space’’ and ‘‘time.’’3 As such, a single speciﬁc construal operation from the schematic system ‘‘conﬁgurational structure’’ (e.g., ± boundedness) may apply to several domains. For example, in the domain of space as well as that of time, concepts may be construed as discrete (i.e., as objects in space and acts in time) or as continuous (as masses in space and activities in time). This way of cross-combining construal operations is linguistically justiﬁed by the fact that in nominalization (which converts concepts from the domain of time to the domain of space) acts are construed as objects and activities as mass, witness such pairs as in (1) and (2):
(1) John called me – John gave me a call. (2) John helped me – John gave me some help.
In Langacker’s approach, Talmy’s domains of ‘‘space’’ and ‘‘time’’ correspond to the conceptual distinction between nouns and verbs. In particular, Langacker (1987, 2005) views nouns as ‘‘things,’’ understood as a construal resulting from conceptual grouping and reiﬁcation, and verbs as ‘‘processes,’’ understood as a construal resulting from sequential scanning of a temporally manifested relationship. However,

construal and perspectivization 55

Figure 3.1. ‘‘Nominal’’ and ‘‘verbal’’ construal of the same content in different constructions
Langacker does not treat the noun-verb distinction as reﬂecting a fundamental schematic category in itself, but rather as a special instance of Figure/Ground organization (in particular, the proﬁle-base organization) and of categorization. The English noun and verb cook, for example, have a shared conceptual content, but in one class of constructions (the cook, etc.), a different part of this content is ‘‘proﬁled’’ than in constructions (to cook, etc.) that encode a processual construal(schematically presented in ﬁgure 3.1).
Because of these (and other) patterns, the English word cook can be regarded as having a schematic sense that does not impose a particular proﬁle and thus serves as a superordinate category for the speciﬁc nominal and verbal uses of the word (Langacker 2005). Figure 3.2 provides a schematic representation.
It is clear from the foregoing that, while the concepts employed in Langacker’s and Talmy’s analyses play a rather different role in their respective frameworks, their approaches basically capture the same insights. Furthermore, they both embrace the idea that several dimensions of construal can be involved in the meaning of a single linguistic expression. What these two points suggest is that any classiﬁcation of construal phenomena in a particular language is likely to be at least to some extent arbitrary, if only because linguistic units often participate in more than a single kind of construal.
Croft and Cruse (2004: 43–46) also indicate that a classiﬁcation of construal phenomena is to some extent arbitrary or cannot be entirely motivated. For one thing, they observe that the classiﬁcations proposed by Langacker and Talmy share a number of features, but also that it is not obvious how the differences can be reconciled. Furthermore, they point out that from both classiﬁcations, some dimensions of construal (e.g., image schemas) are still missing and their integration into the proposed classiﬁcations is not immediately evident. Building on an earlier comparison of construal classiﬁcations (Croft and Wood 2000), Croft and Cruse (2004: 45) then state that the main categories in such a classiﬁcation should correspond to psychological processes and capacities that have been established independently, by psychologists and phenomenologists. But this requirement had, of course, already motivated Langacker’s and Talmy’s classiﬁcations. Thus, it is no surprise that the classiﬁcation proposed by Croft and Cruse overlaps with those by Langacker and

Talmy. Aside from some (smaller) reassignments of speciﬁc kinds of construal to other major categories, the main difference between Croft and Cruse’s classiﬁcation and those of Langacker and Talmy is that the former is more comprehensive than the latter ones. The main categories, according to Croft and Cruse, are:
a. Attention/Salience b. Judgment/Comparison c. Perspective/Situatedness d. Constitution/Gestalt
Category (a), Attention/Salience, in general comprises the same types of construals as the ones subsumed under Talmy’s Attention category (and Langacker’s Prominence), but it also contains as subcategories certain construal phenomena that had the status of major categories in (some version of) Langacker’s and Talmy’s work; speciﬁcally, it includes Langacker’s Abstraction and Talmy’s Schematization (‘‘scalar adjustments’’) and Langacker’s Dynamicity. In addition, it contains the subcategory Scope (including referent accessibility; see Ariel 1990), a category which was not explicitly discussed by Langacker or Talmy.
The second category, Judgment/Comparison, contains the subcategories Categorization, Metaphor, and Figure/Ground. As such, we can observe that Figure/ Ground has been reassigned from the category Attention/Prominence in Talmy’s and Langacker’s work. Furthermore, Categorization is not viewed as a Schematization phenomenon, as Talmy had it—despite the intimate connection between the two. Then again, the inclusion of Metaphor in the classiﬁcation of construal phenomena makes this classiﬁcation more comprehensive than previous ones.
The Perspective category is the one that is obviously most similar to that in the other proposals. The category Constitution/Gestalt, ﬁnally, overlaps with Talmy’s (2000a) category Conﬁgurational Structure, but also includes Force Dynamics.
What conclusions can be drawn from this survey of classiﬁcations? First of all, although all classiﬁcations share the requirement that they should reﬂect general and well-established psychological abilities, they still turn out to be considerably different.
The proposal by Croft and Cruse, who formulate this requirement most emphatically, actually raises the same kind of questions as those that were raised by the other proposals; the assignment of particular construal operations under one rubric rather than another cannot always be clearly motivated (e.g., why, for instance,

33625_u03_UNCORR_PRF.3d_57_05-29-07
construal and perspectivization 57
Fictive Motion should be subsumed under Attention/Salience and not under Constitution/Gestalt?). The increase in coverage of construal operations in Croft and Cruse’s classiﬁcation in fact goes hand in hand with a further decrease of its transparency. It looks as if any new construal operation being discovered requires its own new category. Obviously, this does not mean that certain construal operations must therefore be excluded from the theory, but rather that construal operations may vary in so many different respects that attempts at an exhaustive classiﬁcation necessarily have a considerable degree of arbitrariness. In fact, in his contribution to the present Handbook, Langacker states that his ‘‘classiﬁcation of construal phenomena is . . . mostly for expository convenience’’ (chapter 17, note 22).
An additional reason for taking up this position is the fact that these taxonomies not only serve to classify the construal operations, but also the linguistic elements that express them. Now, what has not been taken into account in any of the classiﬁcation schemes considered is the fact that the type of construal linguistic expressions reﬂect may gradually change. But precisely this observation casts considerable doubt on the feasibility of a psychologically realistic classiﬁcation scheme. We can illustrate this with the phenomenon, well known from grammaticalization studies, that markers of perfectivity may change into markers of past tense. Such a change involves a transfer from the category of conﬁgurational construal operations (imposing boundedness on the conceived event) to the category of perspectival, deictic ones (marking the conceived event as preceding the communicative event). However, the meaning of a linguistic unit does not shift from one class of construal operations to another one overnight; semantic change is gradual. The diachronic development implies that for many speakers of a language for a long time (normally spanning several generations), these perfective expressions reﬂect both types of construal, in the sense that both types remain distinguishable for analysts. For the speakers themselves, however, it makes more sense to assume that they operate with a complex but unitary (‘‘Gestalt-like’’) construal operation in which the effect on the structure of the event (‘completed’) is immediately associated with an effect on the relation of the event to the communicative situation (‘past’). In other words, it is part of these speakers’ knowledge of the conventions of their language that the unit involved conveys this complex construal. It is thus psychologically unrealistic to want to assign this particular construal operation to one category rather than another. For the speakers, it simply is a category in its own right, possibly sharing more or less prototypical characteristics of several other types of construal, some ‘‘conﬁgurational,’’ some ‘‘perspectival.’’ In fact, such conclusions soon appear inevitable on the basis of research into the details of the working of any particular kind of construal operation in actual usage (see Cornelis 1997 on construals effected by passive constructions).
Thus, it is precisely from a cognitive point of view that one should not expect that classiﬁcations of construal operations can be set up that are exhaustive and complete. From this perspective, it is therefore quite appropriate that the chapters to follow simply present the most important and well-studied types of construal operations successively.

The insight that a general classiﬁcation scheme for construal operations is not feasible should not obscure the fact that the set of these operations deﬁnitely exhibits structure—it is not a list of totally unrelated notions. Some subsets of construal operations share more features with each other than with other ones, and as such the entire set of construal phenomena is amenable to a structure comprising some general rubrics under which they can be subsumed on the basis of their recurrent or shared features.
There is one such rubric that stands out as a more general dimension of construal than other ones, namely, perspective. In view of the differences between the different classiﬁcation systems discussed above, it is striking that they show agreement about the relevance of a class of perspectival construal operations. Actually, this is hardly surprising since the concept of ‘‘construal’’ was introduced to capture aspects of conceptualization that cannot be adequately analyzed in terms of the object of conceptualization but require reference to a subject’s perception, choice, or point of view. Accordingly, I will assume that perspective is a central part of the entire range of possible construal relations, in fact a deﬁnitional aspect of prototypical instances of construal.
We may think of the general rubrics under which construal operations can be subsumed as establishing a kind of ‘‘conceptual space’’ for construal. A linguistic element conventionally conveying a speciﬁc kind of construal may in principle occupy any position in this space; elements sharing features can be thought of as close together, forming ‘‘clusters’’ in this space without necessarily belonging in preestablished, bounded regions. Starting from fundamental features of the notion ‘‘construal’’ itself, the remainder of this chapter will develop a general conceptual framework in terms of which construal operations may be characterized, as an alternative to different classiﬁcation schemes discussed before. On the one hand, this framework will not provide a new exhaustive classiﬁcation (nor is it intended as one); on the other hand, it will allow us to see that still more (especially grammatical) phenomena may crucially involve construal (especially perspectivization) than have already been considered so far.
4. A General Framework
for Characterizing
Construal Operations
................................................................................................ .................................................
Langacker (1987: 487–88) deﬁnes the construal relationship as follows: ‘‘The relationship between a speaker (or hearer) and a situation that he conceptualizes and portrays, involving focal adjustments and imagery.’’ In this deﬁnition, the construal

Figure 3.3. A viewing arrangement
relation basically involves an individual (speaker or hearer), on the one hand, and a conceived situation, on the other. Thus, it corresponds closely to Langacker’s ‘‘viewing arrangement’’ (cf. Langacker 1987: 129; 1993: 454). Diagrammatically, this relationship can be represented as in ﬁgure 3.3.
This conﬁguration, being two-dimensional, already embodies one very basic distinction between construal types. As was pointed out in section 2, some construals involve the imposition of structure on the object of conceptualization, while others consist in one conceptualization being understood in relation to another one, in particular the communicative situation. Different sorts of structure (attentional, force-dynamic, etc.) involve the higher, horizontal level of ﬁgure 3.3, while different sorts of relations to the communicative situation (deixis, viewpoint, etc.) concern the vertical relation.4
Langacker subsequently identiﬁes the lower, horizontal level of ﬁgure 3.3 as the ‘‘ground’’ (Langacker 1987: 126; 1990b: 9), which he deﬁnes as the ensemble of the communicative event, its participants, and its immediate circumstances.5 Although in this deﬁnition, the ground includes participants—in plural—rather than a singular ‘‘viewer,’’ no distinction is made between different speech act participants, and the graphic representations given still represent only a single ‘‘viewer’’ (or ‘‘subject’’ of conceptualization).6 Moreover, while the conﬁguration, as depicted in ﬁgure 3.3, is amenable to providing a wide array of cognitive abilities with respect to various objects of conceptualization, it does not accommodate one highly human capacity, namely, to take into account other minds in relation to an object of conceptualization. Indeed, it is a characteristically human trait to be able to identify deeply with conspeciﬁcs. In characterizing biologically determined cognitive differences and similarities between young humans and other primates, Tomasello (1999: 14–15) writes:
There is just one major difference, and that is the fact that human beings ‘identify’ with conspeciﬁcs more deeply than do other primates. This identiﬁcation is not something mysterious, but simply the process by which the human child understands that other persons are beings like herself . . . and so she sometimes tries to understand things from their point of view. . . .

Figure 3.4. The construal conﬁguration and its basic elements
I refer to this process generally as ‘understanding others as intentional (or mental) agents (like the self).’7
Language use, which is dependent on mutually shared knowledge of conventions, is crucially dependent on recognizing others like oneself. So, certainly with respect to linguistically coded conceptualizations, Langacker’s initial way of construing the construal relationship may be treated as a special case of a somewhat more complex conﬁguration that incorporates the insight that language use comprises more than one subject of conceptualization.8 Consider ﬁgure 3.4.
The ‘‘ground’’ of any linguistic usage event consists of two conceptualizers— the ‘‘communicator’’ (conceptualizer 1 in ﬁgure 3.4), who takes responsibility for the utterance, and the ‘‘addressee’’ (conceptualizer 2 in ﬁgure 3.4), with whom the communicator enters into a coordination relation—and the knowledge that they mutually share, including models of each other and of the discourse situation. On this view, the ground is essentially ‘‘common ground’’ (see Clark 1996; also Sinha 1999 for further psychological and philosophical considerations motivating this view of ‘‘ground’’ and Verhagen 2005 for linguistic considerations). The point of a linguistic utterance is, generally speaking, that the ﬁrst conceptualizer invites the second to jointly attend to an object of conceptualization in some speciﬁc way and to update the common ground by doing so; that is, both conceptualizers are involved in coordinating cognition by means of language, with one conceptualizer taking the initiative in each speciﬁc instance. This coordination relationship between the two conceptualizers is indicated by the lower horizontal line in ﬁgure 3.4, and the relation of joint attention between the conceptualizers and the object of conceptualization by the vertical line.
Figure 3.4 represents a conceptual space which can be organized in different ways and which is reﬂected in different linguistic expressions. Extreme cases at one end are those in which the meaning of the expression does not in any respect involve an element of the ground and which may thus be labeled maximally ‘‘objective.’’ Schematically, the ﬁrst type of situation may be represented as in ﬁgure 3.5.

Figure 3.5. Construal conﬁguration in maximally ‘‘objective’’ expressions
The use of dotted lines in ﬁgure 3.5 indicates that, although the ground may be said to ﬁgure in the interpretation of any utterance (in some ‘‘tenuous sense’’; Langacker 1990b: 9), it is not signaled by the conventional meaning of ‘‘maximally objective’’ linguistic units. That is to say, these linguistic units wholly pertain to the level of the object of conceptualization, which is indicated by the use of bold lines: they ‘‘proﬁle’’ aspects of the object of conceptualization, but none at the level of the subjects of conceptualization or of the relation between the two levels. Such ‘‘pure’’ cases are relatively rare, and artiﬁcial. One might think of ‘‘common nouns and verbs considered in isolation (for example lamp, tree, . . .)’’ (Langacker 1990b: 9) or a label like ‘‘bathroom’’ on a door (Theo Janssen, p.c.). Even a noun phrase such as the horse or a simple tensed sentence (John owns a horse) are not purely objective in this sense, as the identity of the referent or the time of the described event are accessed via the communicative situation (which is why the article and the tense marking are called ‘‘grounding predications’’). Note also that, even though in speciﬁc utterances, a single common or proper noun may be used to attract an interlocutor’s attention (Wolves!) or to invite him/her to respond in a particular way (John?), this occurrence of cognitive coordination is not due to the meaning of the nouns, so the ground is not said to be proﬁled by these elements.
The construal conﬁguration, as represented in ﬁgure 3.4, may be used to indicate differences between linguistic units in the same language, but also between seemingly similar elements in different languages or at different historical stages of a language (with one element conventionally marking only certain elements of the construal conﬁguration, and the other some other, or more, elements). This is the way this representation will be used in the remainder of this chapter. The extreme case at the other end involves the mirror image of the situations depicted in ﬁgure 3.5, that is, expressions in which only elements of the ground and/or the relationship between them are proﬁled, and no aspect of an object of conceptualization is marked linguistically. This is represented in ﬁgure 3.6.
Examples of such purely subjective utterances are interjections, as in greetings (Hi), apologies (Sorry), or calls for attention (Hey). Even more simple conﬁgurations

Figure 3.6. Construal conﬁguration in highly ‘‘subjective’’ expressions
may be possible in which only one element is really proﬁled, as in noninteractional signs of disgust or frustration (Yuck, Damn). In actual usage, however, these subjective utterances also involve aspects of language users’ experience that function as objects of conceptualization (such as what triggered the apology or the bad taste of some piece of food), but these objective elements are not indicated by the conventional meanings of these elements, which only express a subjective reaction or organize the relationship between speaker and addressee.
The fact that maximally objective and maximally subjective expressions constitute only restricted kinds of language use demonstrates, in fact, that the normal situation is for linguistic expressions to construe some speciﬁed features of an object of conceptualization in relation to one or more facets of the ground. Labeling objects and producing interjections constitute the opposite extremes on a continuum from maximally objective to maximally subjective expressions, and thus the exceptions; expressions in the ‘‘middle part’’ of this continuum are the rule.
It will be recalled that many of the construal operations presented in sections 2 and 3 reﬂect cognitive abilities relating only to the object level of conceptualization. Still, the fact that the classiﬁcations of construal operations were in agreement on the importance of a class of perspectival construal phenomena suggests that the structure of the basic construal conﬁguration cannot be complete without a subject level of conceptualization. Indeed, expressions evoking perspectival phenomena make explicit reference to the subject level of this conﬁguration, and/or its relation to the object level, while other expressions of construal do not refer to the ground (although, of course, the decision to use, or to refrain from using, any expression, normally involves the ground as it is made by speakers on the basis of an assessment of their interlocutors and the rest of the communicative situation). I have furthermore suggested that the basic construal conﬁguration should be seen as involving a relation of intersubjective coordination, reﬂecting the typically human cognitive ability to identify with conspeciﬁcs and thus to conceive of things from other points of view. I will now develop the latter point further, showing that it not only covers traditionally recognized perspectival construals, but may also extend to other construals in a natural way.

5.1. General Grounding
We have seen that a particular spatial conﬁguration of two entities X and Y can be encoded as X is below Y and as Y is above X, and therefore that the semantics of these expressions necessarily involves an element of construal, in this case Figure/ Ground organization. Another dimension of construal is involved in similar uses of these expressions, as exempliﬁed in (3) and (4):
(3) The ballroom is below. (4) Write to the address above for full details.
In each of these cases, the landmark with respect to which the trajector is located is part of the ground of the utterance. The position of the ballroom in (3) is calculated from the common position of the speech participants or the position of the addressee (for example, when (3) is uttered as an instruction over the telephone). Likewise, if (4) is a sentence in a particular document currently relevant for the speech participants (i.e., part of the common ground), then the location of the address is calculated from the position of sentence (4) in this document. So, in each of these cases, we have a situation, unlike the ones discussed so far, in which a relation between the ground and the object of conceptualization actually is proﬁled in the interpretation of the expressions. This is indicated in ﬁgure 3.7 by the bold vertical line representing the construal relation.
Proﬁling a relationship with the ground is obviously not a necessary condition for the use of such lexical items as below and above, but it is a necessary condition in constructions where the landmark is not represented linguistically. In particular, spatial expressions indicating the position of speciﬁc text portions relative to the currently relevant one, as illustrated by (4) and similar sentences such as Further instructions are below, may be considered a conventional pattern. Thus, it has become a convention of English that the items below and above allow for such a perspectivized construal, and it is this construal which distinguishes them from other items such as beside, which does not participate in a construction of the type X be beside to indicate a position to the side of some element of the ground. Note also that there do not seem to be speciﬁc restrictions on the interpretation of an entity’s location relative to the ground, as long as it is computable from the context in which the utterance is interpreted.
Another example in English of an expression whose landmark may be construed as an element of the ground is across, as is illustrated in (5) and (6).
(5) Vanessa is sitting across the table. (6) Vanessa is sitting across the table from Veronica.

Figure 3.7. Construal conﬁguration in (minimally) ‘‘perspectivized’’ expressions
In (5), the position with respect to which Vanessa is being located is an element of the ground (the speaker), while it is an element of the object of conceptualization in (6). Possibly, there is a difference in degree of conventionality between examples (3) and (4) and examples (5) and (6): the usage of below and above in (3) and (4) represents a special subtype of their ‘‘normal’’ use, whereas, in (5) and (6), it is the subjective construal of across in (5) that can be considered prototypical, and the ‘‘objectiﬁed’’ use in (6) a special subtype. For relative spatial indications such as to the left/right, construal with respect to the ground is always possible, even when an explicit reference point is mentioned. In (7), Vanessa may obviously be sitting at Veronica’s right-hand side, but the relative order of Veronica and Vanessa may also be ‘‘left-to-right’’ from a conceptualizer’s point of view (even though Vanessa might be at Veronica’s left-hand side from Veronica’s point of view, e.g., when they are facing the conceptualizer).
(7) Vanessa is sitting to the right of Veronica.
From the foregoing examples, it appears, then, that there are differences in the degree of conventionality with which a construal conﬁguration such as in ﬁgure 3.7 may be associated with a speciﬁc linguistic form. There are also linguistic items that always comprise a construal with respect to the ground as part of their semantic characterization. The referent of yesterday, for example, can never be determined without using knowledge about the time of the ground. With linguistic items of this kind, we enter the realm of what is traditionally called ‘‘deictic’’ elements (see Brisard 2002, for explorations of deixis from a cognitive point of view). When viewing deixis as a type of construal, however, one no longer restricts it to something limited to and determined by a speciﬁc class of linguistic items (so-called ‘‘deictic’’ morphemes). As we have seen, construal with respect to an element of the ground is something that can be associated with different elements to different degrees of conventionality. Of course, one may want to identify the class of elements in a language whose meanings necessarily invoke elements of the ground as deictic, but that should not imply that deixis does not occur elsewhere.
Other examples of elements whose meaning requires calculation with respect to some element of the ground, that is, as deictic in a broad sense, are the verbs come and go and the simple past tense (in English and several other languages). A particular situation can be described both as Santa Claus came in and as Santa Claus went in;

33625_u03_UNCORR_PRF.3d_65_05-29-07
construal and perspectivization 65

Figure 3.8. ‘‘First-person deixis’’ construal conﬁguration
the different lexicalizations reﬂect different construals with respect to a ‘‘point of view’’ identiﬁable for the conceptualizers (come involves a point of view inside the space entered by Santa Claus; went a point of view outside that space). The choice of this point of view is not further constrained; it may be the speaker’s or the hearer’s, but also that of some participant whose point of view has been introduced explicitly into the discourse (see below, at the end of section 6.2). Slightly differently, the past tense locates an event outside the ground, thus outside the scope of the immediate experiences of the conceptualizers in the ground, without differentiating between them (see Boogaart and Janssen, this volume, chapter 31, for further discussion).
5.2. Speciﬁc Grounding
In addition to the deictic elements indicating a general type of grounding, there are other deictic elements that indicate a different, more speciﬁc kind of construal. Consider ﬁgure 3.8.
This conﬁguration characterizes instances of what may be called ﬁrst-person deixis and is present in expressions such as here, now, and this/these. For example, while the expression yesterday does invoke the ground, it does not proﬁle a temporal point of the ground, and it does not invoke a speciﬁc conceptualizer as distinct from another. The expression now, on the other hand, does proﬁle a time overlapping with that of the ground (i.e., the time envisaged by conceptualizer 1 as the time of communication—not necessarily the moment at which the utterance is physically produced).
Counterparts of ﬁrst-person deixis expressions are there, then, and that/those. The latter are usually characterized as ‘‘distal,’’ while the former are called ‘‘proximate.’’ The terms ‘‘proximate’’ and ‘‘distal’’ suggest that these sets of expressions express different distances between the conceptualizer and the object of conceptualization. However, as Janssen (2002, 2004) has argued, the terms actually have more to do with the construal relationship between conceptualizer and object of conceptualization than with the distance between them. For instance, when a physician investigating a sore spot on a patient utters Is this where it hurts? and the patient responds with Yes, that is where it hurts, the difference between this and that, and especially the patient’s

Figure 3.9. ‘‘Second-person deixis’’ construal conﬁguration
use of that, cannot be adequately characterized in terms of (non)proximity, since the spot referred to is on the patient’s body. Rather, what the patient does is to indicate that the spot referred to is not as much in his/her focus of attention as it is in somebody else’s, in this case, the physician’s (Janssen 2002: 172–73). In this respect, Janssen quotes a suggestion from C. Lyons to the effect that the difference between this and that can be related to the category of person; indeed, in the situation described, a proper paraphrase of the meaning of that would be ‘the spot you are focusing on’, so that it would involve a construal conﬁguration as indicated in ﬁgure 3.9.
However, although ﬁgure 3.9 represents the natural construal conﬁguration for expressions such as that, there, and then in many contexts, it is not applicable to all of their uses. In other contexts these expressions can also proﬁle entities, moments, and locations which have neither the speaker’s nor the addressee’s immediate attention. Thus, the general rule here is that linguistic items expressing this construal are deﬁned negatively with respect to the ground, speciﬁcally conceptualizer 1.
Similarly, so-called third-person personal pronouns (he, she, they, and their oblique and possessive counterparts) are deﬁned negatively with respect to the ground and speciﬁcally with respect to both conceptualizers 1 and 2. Still, the identiﬁcation of their referents has to take place via the ground; they are still objects of shared attention (as ﬁrst and second persons are by participating in the communicative situation), either established ostensively or as prominent discourse referents (see van Hoek 2003).9
6. Coordination of Perspectives
................................................................................................ .................................................
6.1. Implicit Multiple Perspectives
I have characterized the horizontal line between the conceptualizers in the basic construal conﬁguration of ﬁgure 3.4 as representing a process of coordinating cognition. This coordination relation does not play a role in the perspectivized construals discussed so far, but it is crucial in an important class of linguistic

33625_u03_UNCORR_PRF.3d_67_05-29-07
construal and perspectivization 67
expressions, namely, sentential negation and related expressions. Consider, for instance, (8) and (9), each of which is a possible description of a person feeling sad.
(8) Mary is not happy. (9) Mary is unhappy.
Both expressions may be said to invoke the notion of happiness serving as the Ground for the characterization of Mary’s actual state of mind (the Figure). In this dimension of construal, (8) and (9) do not differ, so the difference must involve yet another type of construal. The relevant dimension here is deﬁned by the speciﬁc human ability to entertain other points of view in the same way as one’s own, which we explicitly incorporated into the construal conﬁguration by distinguishing two subjects of conceptualization (the bottom part of ﬁgure 3.4). In particular, it is the coordination relation between the conceptualizers that appears to be crucially involved in distinguishing (8) from (9). It is only sentence (8) that proﬁles two distinct views with respect to the proposition Mary is happy (or two ‘‘mental spaces’’ in the sense of Fauconnier 1985; see also Fauconnier, this volume, chapter 14), that is, only (8) involves two conceptualizers with an opposite epistemic stance toward this proposition (conceptualizer 1 rejects the positive epistemic stance of conceptualizer 2).10 This can observed from the behavior of the phrase on the contrary (Verhagen 2005: 31–32):
(10) Mary is not happy. On the contrary, she is feeling really depressed. (11) #Mary is unhappy. On the contrary, she is feeling really depressed.
The use of the negation not in (10) evokes a second mental space: it proﬁles the contrast between the stance toward ‘Mary being happy’ in some other mental space and the speaker’s (the so-called ‘‘base’’ space of conceptualizer 1). It is this evoked second mental space to which the discourse marker on the contrary can relate: Mary’s being depressed is contrary to the idea of her being happy, not to her not being happy (which is what conceptualizer 1 has just asserted). Morphological negation with un- lacks this power to evoke a second mental space contrasting with the base space, and this is what makes (11) incoherent. Sentential negation thus yields a typical and quite general case of the construal conﬁguration depicted in ﬁgure 3.10.
What the negative morpheme not itself proﬁles is just the relation between the perspectives of the two conceptualizers, namely, a relationship of opposition, such that the view of the conceptualizer 2 should be replaced by that of conceptualizer 1. However, it is part of the conventional use of not that an object of conceptualization has to be speciﬁed (so that it may actually more adequately be regarded as a construction, unlike the negative element No, which precisely cannot be applied to linguistic material proﬁling an object of conceptualization). This is why the construal conﬁguration for sentential negation is represented as in ﬁgure 3.10 rather than as in ﬁgure 3.6. Furthermore, other construal phenomena may be operative with respect to the object of conceptualization as represented in the utterance, determining, for example, Figure/Ground-alignments, temporal deixis, and so on.

Figure 3.10. Construal conﬁguration for coordination of perspectives
So while any linguistic usage event involves two conceptualizers as part of its ground, sentential negation (as well as a phrase such as on the contrary in English) actually proﬁles two viewpoints being brought into coordination in the linguistic material. In the language of adult speakers, and in particular in fairly complex discourse, the point of view being rejected does not have to be the actual addressee’s, and not even a speciﬁc person’s, but even when it is not precisely ‘‘anchored’’ in the actual communicative situation, it remains a proﬁled mental space in which a different epistemic stance toward the proposition is entertained than in the space of conceptualizer 1. Another type of construction to which the same general characterization applies is that of concessive connectives (see Verhagen 2000; 2005: chapter 4).
Viewing sentential negation as a case of construal—proﬁling the coordination relation between two epistemically distinct conceptualizers with respect to the same object of conceptualization—has the advantage of allowing for a natural extension to other elements that behave conceptually and linguistically like negation, even though they may differ from negation in terms of truth conditions. For example, the expressions few linguists and a few linguists may refer to sets of exactly the same size (whether absolute or relative), but only the former construes the relationship between the two conceptualizers with respect to the object of conceptualization as one of opposition. It exhibits the grammatical behavior of negation (witness contrasts in the context of polarity items, e.g., any: Few linguists have any idea about evolutionary theory vs. *A few linguists have any idea about evolutionary theory). The same holds for its discourse behavior, witness the naturalness of the exchange in A–B in (12) in contrast with the exchange in (13), in which A–B is not natural, but A–B’ is.
(12) A: Few linguists still believe in transformations. B: So you think they won’t be around much longer? B': #So you think they’ll still be around for some time?
(13) A: A few linguists still believe in transformations. B: #So you think they won’t be around much longer? B': So you think they’ll still be around for some time?

Figure 3.11. Construal conﬁguration for epistemic interpretation
This parallelism between grammatical and discourse properties clearly demonstrates that what is proﬁled by sentential negation, as well as other ‘‘negative’’ elements, is a relation of epistemic opposition between two conceptualizers, conceptualizer 1 rejecting the cognitive state of conceptualizer 2 in the process of representing it (for further elaboration and discussion, see Verhagen 2005: chapter 2). It should be noted, though, that this brief discussion can hardly scratch the surface of the complexities involved in negation and polarity, especially in relation to the scalar inferences invited by many expressions in natural languages (see Israel 1998, and especially various studies by Horn, of which Horn 1996 is illustrative).
Yet another subtype of expressions that instantiate this type of construal are modal verbs and adverbs, as exempliﬁed in (14) and (15).
(14) Some theoreticians may deny the relevance of these results. (15) Frankly, some theoreticians deny the relevance of these results.
In a sentence like Someone with such a track record may say things like this, the modal auxiliary may designates a relationship of permission in the object of conceptualization (‘being allowed’, the so-called deontic reading).11 But the natural interpretation of may in (14) is that it designates a relationship in the ground; it evokes the views that some theoreticians deny the relevance of the results and that some do not, and proﬁles conceptualizer 1 as the ground element endorsing that the former possibility is the one to be reckoned with. It appears, then, that epistemic construal shares properties with sentential negation in proﬁling parts of the ground but differs from sentential negation in that, besides evoking two conceptualizers with distinct epistemic stances, it also makes a deﬁnite claim about the object of conceptualization. Although epistemic may, as in (14), operates on an object of conceptualization, it does not, in this sense, designate an element of the object of conceptualization, but only of the ground; its construal is of the type depicted in ﬁgure 3.11.12
Similarly, the adverb frankly in (15) does not designate the presence of frankness in one of the participants in the conceptualized event. Rather, it proﬁles both the present speaker’s frankness in saying this, as well as an attempt to acknowledge the fact that the addressee may not like the implications.13 The reading in which frankly proﬁles an aspect of the object of conceptualization rather than the ground

33625_u03_UNCORR_PRF.3d_70_05-29-07

is more natural with another word order and intonation contour (Some theoreticians frankly deny the relevance of these results). The fact that in front position frankly takes elements of the ground (the utterance itself and how it may be taken by the addressee) as its base and not the object of conceptualization implies that the construal relation itself is in this case even less proﬁled than in the case of epistemic may, so that this frankly-sentence exempliﬁes the highly subjective construal conﬁguration of ﬁgure 3.6 rather than that of ﬁgure 3.11. Yet, the highly subjective nature of a construal is certainly a matter of degree, as the use of frankly still imposes a constraint on the nature of the object of conceptualization: it must be some piece of discourse.
Some elements in a language may allow objective as well as epistemic, and ‘‘speech act’’ construals. This has been proposed, for example, for some causal connectives (e.g., because in English) by Sweetser (1990). Consider the following examples.
(16) John typed her thesis because he really loves her. (17) John really loves her, because he typed her thesis. (18) What are you doing tonight? Because there’s a good movie on.
In (16), because proﬁles a causal relationship as part of the object of conceptualization; in (17), it construes an element of the object of conceptualization (the fact that John typed her thesis) as an argument for the addressee to accept the conclusion that John’s love for her must also be part of the object of conceptualization (an epistemic construal of the type depicted in ﬁgure 3.11); and in (18), it justiﬁes an element of the ground itself, namely, the speech act of asking.
What we have seen, then, is that these are all linguistic expressions—just like the spatial markers below and across—that as such allow both relatively objective and relatively subjective construals. The actual type of construal varies depending on several contextual features (for an illuminating discussion of such factors in the case of modals, see Heine 1995). Whether there are constraints on the types of construal allowed for speciﬁc linguistic items is a matter of (historically developed) convention. As Sweetser noted, there are languages in which an objective or an epistemic construal of a causal relationship requires distinct causal connectives; the fact that because can be used in these different, historically developed ways, is thus a convention of modern English. We will brieﬂy return to this issue in section 7, on subjectiﬁcation.
6.2. Explicit Multiple Perspectives
The use of modal auxiliaries and adverbs as in (14) and (15) is sometimes called ‘‘speaker-oriented’’ and paraphrased by means of complement constructions with a ﬁrst-person subject in the matrix clause (e.g., I consider it possible that . . . , I frankly say to you that . . . ). This raises the issue what aspects of the construal conﬁguration are proﬁled by such complement constructions themselves. Until fairly recently, it was usually (explicitly or implicitly) assumed that complement clauses are subor-

construal and perspectivization 71

Figure 3.8'. Construal conﬁguration with ‘‘ﬁrst person’’ as object of conceptualization
dinate structures, occupying an argument position of the predicate in the ‘‘main’’ clause and are thus subordinate (e.g., Jespersen 1933; Noonan 1985, among many others). In cognitive linguistic work, this view has also been the starting point of a number of analyses; for example, Langacker (1991: 436) states: ‘‘Complement clauses are prototypical instances of subordination; . . . I know she left designates the process of knowing, not of leaving.’’ As the example demonstrates, such a view suggests that the main clause of a complement construction (also when it involves an element of the ground) describes an event in the same way as a simple clause does, that is, as an object of conceptualization. Recent research, however, suggests that in many important cases this is actually a misconception. Studying child language acquisition, Diessel and Tomasello (2001) have shown that, apparently, children’s ﬁrst complement constructions contain ‘‘complement-taking predicates’’ of the type I think and you know, which function ‘‘as an epistemic marker, attention getter, or marker of illocutionary force,’’ and that the whole complex utterance ‘‘contains only a single proposition expressed by the apparent complement clause’’ (97). Thus, the complement-taking predicates do not contribute to proﬁling an object of conceptualization; rather, they instantiate the construal conﬁguration of ﬁgure 3.11, only proﬁling (parts of) the ground. It is only at later stages that children start saying things like I thought and She knows, in which someone’s thinking or knowing may be construed as an object of conceptualization (see ﬁgures 3.5 and 3.7) and the complement-taking predications as ‘‘main clauses’’ to which the ‘‘complement’’ is ‘‘subordinated.’’14 Once this ability has developed, it also becomes possible for a conceptualizer, in uttering I think, to construe his own thinking as an object of conceptualization for speciﬁc purposes, as in I think he will arrive on time, but I am not sure/but John is skeptical (especially with I or think stressed in the ﬁrst conjunct). While the use of I think as an epistemic marker constitutes an instance of ﬁgure 3.11, its construal as an object of conceptualization is a special case of ﬁgure 3.8. It is a case of ﬁrst-person deixis (belonging to the same family as now, here, and this), but with conceptualizer 1 as an element of the object of conceptualization in the construal conﬁguration. It may thus be called an instance of ‘‘objectiﬁcation,’’15 whereby the primary subject of conceptualization is construed as part of its own object of conceptualization; see ﬁgure 3.8'.

However, such a ‘‘detached’’ view of one’s own cognitive state cannot be considered a very normal use for these constructions. In fact, the analysis by Diessel and Tomasello entails that even after the development of the ability to construe the content of a complement-taking predicate as a possible object of conceptualization, phrases such as I think, I/You see simply continue to be used as markers of epistemic stance, attention-getting, or illocutionary force. This is strongly corroborated, at least for conversational interaction, in a study by Thompson (2002), showing that participants in conversation organize important aspects of their interaction, and of their (common) personal relationships with the things being talked about, by means of such complement-taking predicates, and that this organizational role in fact exhausts the function of these fragments of discourse. The analysis by Thompson actually provides the basis for an explanation of the correlation noted by Diessel and Tomasello (2001: 136) between the ﬁrst complement-taking predicates in children’s utterances and their frequency in the ambient language produced by their parents and caretakers.
Such results, then, show that not only lexical items but also grammatical constructions—including complementation constructions, which are generally considered a core part of syntax—may exhibit variation that can be captured in terms of the general construal conﬁguration, with a crucial role for its subjective part, the ground. This conclusion need not really be surprising for a framework recognizing a continuum between lexicon and grammar and adopting an essentially cognitive view of linguistic semantics, but it still had to be demonstrated.
One speciﬁc use of these grammatical constructions is that they may assign an object of conceptualization to a conceptualizer in a particular way. While sentential negation and modal verbs and adverbs implicitly evoke another mental space besides that of conceptualizer 1, complement constructions may to some extent put another mental space ‘‘on stage’’ (but cf. note 13).16 When they do, they provide the conceptualization of the ground entering into a construal relationship with the content of the subordinated clause; in that case, these complement constructions are not directly interpreted as construed by the actual producer of the discourse, but by the represented subject of conceptualization. Consider a simple case such as (19).
(19) The president is afraid that he might not be re-elected.
The actual speaker of (19) may have a certain knowledge about the president’s reelection (for example, when the speaker is in charge of the election process and has just completed the count of the votes). The use of might relates to the epistemic stance of the president. The alternative mental space evoked by might—and the same would go for the negation not—are construed with respect to the latter stance and not the epistemic stance of the actual producer of the utterance.
Note that different elements behave differently in such constructions. For example, the ﬁrst-person pronoun in a complement clause always designates the person responsible for the whole utterance (The president was afraid that I might fail), while the ‘‘proximate’’ demonstrative this is ambiguous. (In The president was afraid that he might fail at this point, this either refers to the point that is in ‘his’

construal and perspectivization 73
focal attention or that is in ‘mine’—the former reading in effect boils down to construing a ‘‘free indirect speech’’ representation.) Shifting of the deictic center occurs not only in the context of complement constructions, although this constitutes the prime grammaticalized instrument for a deictic shift. In principle, any explicit introduction of another person’s state of mind in a discourse may produce such a shift, as illustrated by (20).
(20) I looked through the window and saw that the children were very nervous. In few minutes, Santa Claus would come in.
The question what constitutes the ground with respect to the elements few and come should be directly construed, and how this relates to the ground of the producer of the entire discourse may involve considerable complexities (see Sanders 1994). But whatever the details, the very fact that such differential construals are generally possible is a major motivation for characterizing the construal conﬁguration in terms of the slightly abstract roles of ‘‘conceptualizers’’ (e.g., conceptualizers 1 and 2, with the ﬁrst being interpreted as taking the initiative), rather than in terms of the concrete roles of actual speaker and hearer (see Talmy 2000b: 337). The actual speaker of (20) does not have to be taken as expressing any personal uncertainty or anxiety concerning Santa Claus’s arrival (imagine that I refers to the person playing the role of Santa Claus), but few still evokes the subjective stance and come the deictic origin of the conceptualizer responsible for the thought of Santa’s entering, that is, the children.
7. Subjectiﬁcation
................................................................................................ .................................................
So far we have used the different proﬁling patterns in the basic construal conﬁguration of ﬁgure 3.4 as ways of capturing recurring features in the meaning and use of several kinds of expressions. It has already been hinted at (in the beginning of section 4 and in section 6.2) that relationships between different proﬁling patterns can also be conceived of as the outcome of dynamic processes. In the course of children’s language development, for example, complement-taking predicates start out as purely epistemic markers and later acquire the potential of designating an object of conceptualization. Such a process may appropriately be characterized as one of objectiﬁcation: initially, an expression does not proﬁle any element of an object of conceptualization, but in the end it does.
The reverse process is that of subjectiﬁcation. In its pure form, subjectiﬁcation may involve an expression initially proﬁling no part of the ground or not proﬁling the construal relationship and then acquiring the potential of proﬁling, in one or more respects, the construal relationship and/or parts of the ground (a possible example is the shift from marking perfectivity to marking past tense as discussed

at the end of section 3). But it may also consist in an increase of the role of the construal relation or the ground in the proﬁle of an expression, or (what ultimately may be part of the same process) a decrease of the role of the object of conceptualization.
The phenomenon of subjectiﬁcation is a highly regular and characteristic feature of many processes of language change, as demonstrated in a considerable body of work by Traugott (e.g., Traugott 1989, 1995, and especially the comprehensive Traugott and Dasher 2002). Traugott deﬁnes subjectiﬁcation as a pragmaticsemantic process whereby ‘‘meanings become increasingly based in the speaker’s subjective belief state/attitude toward the proposition’’ (Traugott 1989: 35; 1995: 31). Notice two features of this deﬁnition: subjectiﬁcation refers to a historical process producing a change, and it is semasiological, that is, it is concerned with linguistic symbols (or assemblies of symbols) and with what they mean. Thus, the development of English will, from expressing a desire or intention on the part of the referent of its grammatical subject to expressing a prediction by the speaker of the utterance, is a clear case of subjectiﬁcation under this deﬁnition.
It should be noted, in order to avoid confusion, that the term ‘‘subjectiﬁcation’’ is used here in a way that is different from, albeit related to, the one proposed by Langacker (1990b: 17). For Langacker ‘‘subjectivity’’ and ‘‘subjectiﬁcation’’ refer not to expressions, but primarily to the way an element of a conceptualization is perspectively construed, namely, objectively or subjectively (cf. Langacker 1999: 150). For example, the difference between Vanessa is sitting across the table from me and Vanessa is sitting across the table according to Langacker is that the same content (the speaker as the landmark of the across-relation) is ‘‘objectively construed’’ in the former because it is put on stage by the expression me (similarly to another nominal expression (see 5 above), whereas it is ‘‘subjectively construed’’ in the latter because it remains offstage as the implicit locus of conception (see (6) above). Accordingly, Langacker uses the term ‘‘subjectiﬁcation’’ to refer to an increase in subjectivity in this sense, namely, the increased construal of some notion as functioning implicitly in the ground rather than on stage, in the conceived situation; subjectiﬁcation is ‘‘the realignment of some relationship from the objective axis to the subjective axis’’ (Langacker 1990b: 17), where ‘‘subjective axis’’ refers to the construal relationship.
Although Langacker’s and Traugott’s notions of subjectiﬁcation are related, each is clearly useful in its own domain, the former primarily in the area of semantic analysis, the latter in that of semantic change. There has been some discussion of the precise relation between Langacker’s and Traugott’s notions (see several contributions in Stein and Wright 1995; Langacker 1999: 149–50; Traugott and Dasher 2002: 97–98). Still, it seems that when restricted to phenomena of semasiological change—which Langacker evidently wants to include under his rubric of subjectiﬁcation—at least the extensions of the two notions coincide: whenever a new meaning is more based in the speaker’s belief state/attitude than the old one, some realignment from the objective to the subjective axis has apparently taken place. In this section, I am concerned with a certain kind of shift in the

33625_u03_UNCORR_PRF.3d_75_05-29-07
construal and perspectivization 75
meanings of linguistic items, which is why my use of the term here is basically the same as its use in studies of semantic change.
Diachronic subjectiﬁcation exhibits ‘‘unidirectionality’’: the meaning of a linguistic expression (in a semasiological perspective) is much more likely to develop from relatively objective to more subjective than the other way around. Thus, one repeatedly ﬁnds a verb of desire and/or intention developing into a marker of future (e.g., English will), but seldom a future marker developing into a verb denoting intention. Temporal connectives regularly develop adversative meanings (e.g., English while, as in Mary likes oysters while Bill hates them), but adversative connectives seldom, if ever, develop into temporal ones (see Bybee, this volume, chapter 36). What is it that makes subjectiﬁcation largely unidirectional? The answer to that question must lie in the actual processes that produce the changes. For several cases, Traugott has shown that the relevant cognitive and communicative mechanisms involve inferences that are ﬁrst ‘‘only’’ pragmatic, that is, related to speciﬁc instances of use in a particular context, and then become associated with the linguistic expression as such, in other words, ‘‘conventionalized.’’ For example, when the actual relevance of mentioning the co-temporality of two events by means of while lies in its unexpectedness and hearers/readers assume that it is this unexpectedness that the speaker/writer intended, the association between while and unexpectedness may be reinforced to the extent that it becomes conventionalized (i.e., the marker of co-temporality can be used to mark unexpectedness without the hearer having to compute the answer to the question ‘Why is the speaker marking co-temporality here?’), even to the extent that co-temporality may become unnecessary. The process of the conventionalization of pragmatic inferences explains unidirectionality in that even if the original conventional meaning of an expression at some point in time does not proﬁle a feature of the ground, the communicative acts in which it is used will always comprise participants making inferences— hearers constructing interpretations of what the speakers intended and speakers anticipating those interpretations—so that there are always (more) subjective elements in actual interpretations that may end up getting conventionalized.
The general unidirectionality of subjectiﬁcation points to a fundamental asymmetry in the construal conﬁguration. The actual use of any linguistic utterance always entails that one conceptualizer is trying to inﬂuence another one’s cognition in a particular way by means of that speciﬁc utterance so that some (further) inferences from the object of conceptualization to the ground are always relevant.17 But knowing what kind of coordination relationship is at stake in a speciﬁc communicative event does not as such license inferences concerning the object of conceptualization. Any expression, even if it does not proﬁle the construal relationship or the ground, evokes the basic construal relation of ﬁgure 3.4 in a particular way when it is actually used, and the recurrence of such features may gain prominence and become conventional. In this essentially usage-based perspective, all linguistic utterances display subjectivity of some sort, and subjectiﬁcation may consist in the gradual diminishing of the ‘‘weight’’ of objective features of conventional meaning in favor of subjective ones. For example, consider the difference between (21) and

(22), containing instances of the objective and of the subjectiﬁed (epistemic) use of the speech act verb promise, respectively.
(21) John promised to be back in time. (22) The debate promised to be interesting.
It is not the case that only (22) conveys a positive anticipation by the speaker. This is just as much true for (21); witness the kind of inferences (21) licenses with respect to the ground: it counts as a positive answer to the question ‘Do you think that John will be back in time?’, and it would not be felicitous in a context in which the person asking that question obviously does not desire John’s timely return. Furthermore, there are also in-between cases such as (23) and (24).
(23) The newspaper promised to publish the results. (24) The new strategy promised to produce interesting results.
These examples differ from each other and from (21) and (22), not so much in the dimension ‘‘subjective, positive anticipation’’ (which they all share), but in the degree to which a promise is considered to be (also) a part of the object of conceptualization. It is easier for the newspaper in (23) than for the strategy in (24) to be construed as metonymically or metaphorically related to human beings who are conceptualized as committing themselves to something, and this is totally impossible for the debate in (22). Thus, it actually seems better to characterize the cline from (21), via (23) and (24), to (22) in terms of decreasing objectivity than in terms of increasing subjectivity (see Langacker 1999 and Verhagen 1995 for further discussion, including syntactic correlates of the semantic differences).18 In any case, the differences and changes can all be construed as ‘‘shifts’’ in the degree of proﬁling of elements and relations in the basic construal conﬁguration.
At the same time, this analysis once more demonstrates that it is crucial to distinguish between the conventional forms of construal made available by the resources of a language, and the construal conveyed in a particular instance of use. In the domain of perspectivization discussed in this section, the phenomenon of semantic change precisely consists in usage becoming conventionalized, which therefore presupposes the distinction.
8. Conclusion
................................................................................................ .................................................
Construal operations are central to language and cognition. They involve cognitive abilities of humans with clear linguistic reﬂexes, but there seems to be no way to organize them all in terms of an exhaustive classiﬁcation system. Although the basic construal conﬁguration presented in this chapter is not a comprehensive classiﬁcation system, it incorporates the typically human ability to identify deeply

construal and perspectivization 77
with conspeciﬁcs and provides a unifying conceptual framework in terms of which many semantic phenomena involving different kinds of ‘‘perspective’’ and ‘‘subjectivity’’ can be captured. The dimensions and elements of the conﬁguration may be considered general and universal, but the actual distinctions drawn in this conceptual space differ from one language to another and are variable over time, in individual development as well as historically (in communities). The general unidirectionality of historical processes of subjectiﬁcation can be taken as indicative of the basic asymmetry between subject and object of conceptualization.
NOTES
................................................................................................ .................................................
I wish to thank the Netherlands Institute for Advanced Study (NIAS) for providing me with the opportunity, as a Fellow-in-residence, to write this chapter. I would also like to thank Peter Harder, Theo Janssen, Ronald Langacker, and Mirna Pit, as well as the editors of this volume, for useful comments on the ﬁrst draft of this chapter. Any remaining errors and misconceptions are entirely my own responsibility.
1. In his 1993 paper, Langacker arranged (‘‘[if] only for expository purposes,’’ 448) construal into the following ﬁve general dimensions: speciﬁcity, scope, prominence, background, and perspective.
2. It has been suggested (Croft and Cruse 2004: chapter 3) that in his recent work, Talmy dropped Force Dynamics as a separate construal category. Still, although Force Dynamics it is not treated separately in chapter 1 of Talmy (2000a), it is clear from the structure of the book that Talmy intended to maintain it (see also Talmy 2000a: 41).
3. While Talmy proposes Domain as a schematic category perpendicular to his four types of ‘‘schematic systems,’’ Croft and Cruse (2004: chapter 3) rather suggest that Domain is an additional system. Talmy (2000a: 47) mentions one additional member of the category Domain, namely, ‘‘identiﬁcational space,’’ to accommodate such differences as those between you and they in their indeﬁnite uses (the former indicating identiﬁcation with the speaker, the second nonidentiﬁcation).
4. The object of conceptualization is represented as having at least some complexity (there are two elements, connected in one way or another) precisely because of the structural construal normally imposed on it.
5. Langacker’s term ‘‘ground’’ is not to be confused with the term ‘‘Ground’’ in ‘‘Figure/Ground alignment.’’
6. In later work in Cognitive Grammar (e.g., Langacker 1999, van Hoek 2003), one does sometimes ﬁnd representations in which the roles of S(peaker) and H(earer) are distinguished.
7. For a more recent, and more subtle view, see Tomasello, Call, and Hare (2003a, 2003b).
8. In practice, many instances of construal conﬁgurations in the literature exhibit this structure, as in Langacker (1990b) and van Hoek (2003).
9. Van Hoek (1997) provides a cognitive account of the way third-person pronouns ﬁnd their antecedents in sentences and in discourse, partly drawing on the inherent link between ﬁrst-person and third-person pronouns as markers of ‘‘other ﬁrst persons.’’

10. A possible semantic difference is also that (8) need not entail (9), while the reverse entailment holds, so that (9) is, strictly speaking, more informative than (8). However, in actual usage, one seldom, if ever, uses (8) to convey that Mary’s position on the scale of happiness is right in the middle. This actually leads to an interesting observational question: Why do language users so often choose an apparently less informative question when a more informative one is readily available? The answer is given in the analysis in the text (a detailed discussion can be found in Verhagen 2005: 32–35, 70–75).
11. With some interpretive effort, it is also possible to impose a deontic interpretation on (14), e.g., when some theoreticians is understood as referring to a group that has a special status for one reason or another, which justiﬁes their being allowed certain kinds of behavior.
12. Langacker (1990b: 14) characterizes modals, also in their epistemic senses, as proﬁling the object of conceptualization (schematically). He mentions in this connection that modals may function as clausal pro-forms (She may, You must). However, this possibility is speciﬁc for English and may possibly be ascribed to the existence in the grammar of English of the general pattern Subject þ Auxiliary (with the function of indicating a clausal pro-form), so that the function of the epistemic modal itself may still be said to involve only the construal relationship and the ground itself.
13. As such, it represents a case of what Traugott calls ‘‘intersubjectiﬁcation,’’ i.e., the development of a meaning which not (only) proﬁles a speaker’s subjective attitude toward a proposition, but also his/her assessment of his/her relationship with the addressee in the production of the utterance. Other instances of intersubjectiﬁcation are tu/vous-type distinctions in second-person address forms and honoriﬁcs (cf. Traugott and Dasher 2002).
14. In fact, I argue in Verhagen (2001, 2005) that it is normal for all complements, also in written texts, to contain the information which an utterance actually contributes to a discourse, even if the main clause may be read as independently designating an event (of communication, cognition, or the like) distinct from the ground. For instance, these main clauses rarely participate in the coherence relations of the discourse (unlike the complements); rather, they serve to specify in what way the information of the complement relates to the perspective of conceptualizers 1 and/or 2 (as someone else’s, as something hoped for, as a possibility, etc.). Further consequences, especially for the grammatical properties of the constructions, are discussed in Verhagen (2005: chapter 3).
15. The content of this concept as I use it here is similar, if not identical, to that of Langacker’s (1987). As I see it, the difference is that Langacker indiscriminatingly considers all uses of the pronoun I as instantiating the conﬁguration of ﬁgure 3.8'—in which conceptualizer 1 ‘‘is also the primary object of conceptualization’’ (131), while I consider many normal uses of the pronoun in such patterns as I think as well as in performative utterances as indicating only conceptualizer 1, without turning him/her into an object of conceptualization.
16. Another type of construction with a similar function is conditionals; see Dancygier and Sweetser (1997) and especially Dancygier and Sweetser (2005).
17. For a discussion of the theory of communication underlying this view, see Verhagen (2005: chapter 1).
18. It remains true, of course, that to the degree that objective conceptualization fades as part of the meaning of an expression, the relative weight of subjectivity automatically increases.
