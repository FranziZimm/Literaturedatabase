Grammatical categories and cognition uses original, empirical data to examine the Sapir-Whorf linguistic relativity hypothesis: the proposal that the grammar of the particular language we speak affects the way we think about reality. The author compares the grammar of American English with that of Yucatec Maya, an indigenous language spoken in southeastern Mexico, focusing on differences in the number marking patterns of the two languages. He then identifies distinctive patterns of thought relating to these differences by means of a systematic assessment of memory and classification preferences among speakers of both languages.
The study concretely illustrates the new approach to empirical research on the linguistic relativity hypothesis which Lucy develops in a companion volume, Language diversity and thought.

Grammatical categories and cognition

Studies in the Social and Cultural Foundations of Language
The aim of this series is to develop theoretical perspectives on the essential social and cultural character of language by methodological and empirical emphasis on the occurrence of language in its communicative and interactional settings, on the socioculturally grounded "meanings" and "functions" of linguistic forms, and on the social scientific study of language use across cultures. It will thus explicate the essentially ethnographic nature of linguistic data, whether spontaneously occurring or experimentally induced, whether normative or variational, whether synchronic or diachronic. Works appearing in the series will make substantive and theoretical contributions to the debate over the sociocultural-function and structural-formal nature of language, and will represent the concerns of scholars in the sociology and anthropology of language, anthropological linguistics, sociolinguistics, and socioculturally informed psycholinguistics.

Acknowledgments
The present research received funding from several sources. A Doherty Charitable Foundation Fellowship for Advanced Study in Latin America provided support for my initial ethnographic field research in Yucatan, Mexico. The specific psycholinguistic projects undertaken both in the US and in Mexico were supported by a National Institute of Mental Health Public Health Service Individual National Research Service Award for Dissertation Research (Grant F31 MH07494). These funds were supplemented by a coterminous International Doctoral Research Fellowship Award (Latin America and Caribbean Program) from the Social Science Research Council and the American Council of Learned Societies. Ongoing work, briefly mentioned here, has been supported by the Spencer Foundation (Chicago). I am grateful to all these organizations for their support. Finally, during the writing of this book I had the good fortune to have the intellectual and financial support of the Center for Psychosocial Studies in Chicago. I thank Bernard Weissbourd, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Center, for making my period of residence possible and Ben Lee, Director of the Center, for giving this project his personal and intellectual support.
Much of the empirical portion of this research was conducted in Mexico; the assistance my wife and I received while doing our research there requires special comment. Norberto Gonzalez Crespo, then director of Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia, Centro Regional del Sureste, gave us a gracious welcome to the local anthropological research community in Yucatan and provided assistance during our first year there. Alfonso Villa Rojas provided useful ethnographic advice on locating an appropriate field site. Juan Ramon Bastarrachea Manzano of the Academia Maya and Jose Tec Po'ot (at that time with the Escuela de Antropologia de la Universidad de Yucatan) gave assistance in evaluating possible research locations from the point of view of linguistic research. The late Alfredo Barrera Vasquez, doyen of Yucatecan linguists, made

various private documentary materials available and was a gracious and encouraging host during our all-too-infrequent visits with him in Merida. Victor Castillo Vales, director of the Escuela del Psicologia de la Universidad de Yucatan, was our lone psychological colleague in Yucatan, but he was an ideal one. Over the years, Don Victor has provided intellectual dialogue, research assistance and collaboration, and advice and assistance in innumerable practical matters. Finally Aline and James Callaghan, Americans resident in Merida at the time of our research, provided much practical help and some respite from the always demanding personal task of working in a foreign culture.
In our research location in eastern Yucatan we were assisted by many people. In Valladolid, our supply town, Mario and Lupita Escalante provided us with every imaginable assistance. To them I owe a good part not only of the pleasure but also of the success of myfieldresearch. Also in Valladolid, Gabriel Cano Gongora also took a keen interest in my research and provided practical help as well. To all the people of my village field site, I owe my gratitude for their good-natured adoption of me and my family into their midst. In particular, I thank Gonzalo Och Yupit, Maria Eugenia Dzul U'u, and Alfonzo Cupul Pat - my principal informants and closest friends in the village - for patiently guiding me into an understanding of their language and way of life.
This research project was stimulated, guided, and supported by my various teachers at the University of Chicago, including Robert LeVine, Richard Shweder, David McNeill, and Janellen Huttenlocher. Norman McQuown introduced me to the intricacies of the Yucatec Maya language. Michael Silverstein's research on case marking provided the inspiration for the particular grammatical analysis developed in this work. Finally, Susan Goldin-Meadow, through her intellectual enthusiasm and personal support, helped give me the confidence to make the research public despite its imperfections.
I also received much encouragement and help from friends and family. William Hanks and I learned Yucatec together and continue to learn much about Yucatan and ourselves by comparing our field experiences with one another. Alan Fiske and Kathy Mason, friends and fellow students in Human Development, shared with me and my wife the difficulties and rewards - both personal and intellectual - of undertaking anthropological fieldwork. Anna Gaskins cheerfully and competently supervised our US affairs while we were abroad.
Finally, I thank my immediate family - my wife Suzanne Gaskins and my sons Robert and Steven - for their personal support both in the field research and during the writing of this work. Suzanne has also been a partner in the research and there are no words that can adequately

Introduction
The present study forms part of a two volume work that re-examines empirical research on the linguistic relativity hypothesis, that is, the hypothesis that differences among languages in the grammatical structuring of meaning influence habitual thought.
The companion work, Language diversity and thought: a reformulation of the linguistic relativity hypothesis, presents an analytic review of the historical development of the linguistic relativity hypothesis and various past attempts to provide empirical evidence directly relevant to it. The review is concerned with methodology in the broad sense, that is, with identifying the general requirements of adequate empirical work on this problem. The review analyzes in detail theflawsand the achievements of existing studies with the aim of formulating an improved approach to such empirical research. The present work provides a concrete case study which utilizes this improved approach.
General goals
The global aim of the project described in the present volume is to demonstrate how the linguistic relativity hypothesis as traditionally conceived can be investigated empirically. Taking Whorf's formulation and subsequent empirical research as the point of departure, four components of adequate empirical research on the linguistic relativity hypothesis were described in the concluding chapter of Language diversity and thought. The discussion also indicated which approaches were most likely to lead to significant progress at the present time. These components and the proposed approaches to them can be distilled as follows.
First, such research must be comparative, that is, it must present contrastive data on two or more language communities. Without a comparative dimension, nothing can be established about the impact of
1

2

Grammatical categories and cognition

language differences. Ideally, the languages at issue should contrast widely so that clear, strong differences are at stake. The comparison should also be undertaken with a broad understanding both of the attested world-wide range of language types and of the particular cultural context of the specific language communities being compared.
Second, at present, such comparison should take an external nonlinguistic reality as the metric or standard for calibrating the content of linguistic and cognitive categories. The development of an adequate, neutral metric represents the crucial analytic problem in any project on the relativity issue. Without such a metric, one cannot say with precision in what respect one language's categories differ from another's or establish that a language category and a cognitive category concern a common domain. Operationally, such a characterization can be formulated by basing it on a wide sample of languages. This assures adequacy since we know that the features of reality captured by such an analysis are those relevant to the actual use of languages, and it assures neutrality since no single language's categories dominate the characterization.
Third, the languages of the communities being studied must be contrasted as to how they differently construe a common reality. This will involve a formal analysis of the morphosyntactic categories of the language with special attention to their referential values, that is, their relationship to the contextual surround. Such an analysis should focus on a whole configuration of meaning rather than on an isolated lexical or grammatical category, and it should attempt to state the contrast between the configurations within a unified framework. At present, the focus should be on language patterns as they are habitually used in everyday talk. Eventually, it will be necessary to attend to differences in patterns of use if it turns out that language patterns have some effects on thought.
Fourth, the implications of the language differences for thought must be articulated. This involves proposing plausible cognitive entailments of the habitual use of the language patterns at issue. Then there must be some attempt to assess empirically whether the hypothesized cognitive outcomes are present in samples of actual speakers of the languages. Such assessments should be designed so as to present equivalent opportunities to the various language groups, which will involve being sensitive to the cultural context of the assessments. Operationally, this involves asking speakers to engage in tasks with certain materials selected to operationally represent the "reality" at issue. With proper design, such controlled assessment procedures can make alternative explanations of the observed behaviors highly unlikely.

Overview of the study

Introduction

3

The specific focus of this study is on whether differences in the grammatical treatment of nominal number (for example, pluralization) in Yucatec Maya and American English correspond with detectable differences in habitual thought as assessed through simple cognitive tasks involving attention, memory, and classification. Because the range of material covered in these chapters crosses a number of traditional disciplinary boundaries, clarity of exposition will be emphasized, in some cases at the expense of full technical detail. In most cases such detail is provided in appendices unless the relevant material is available elsewhere in published form.
The study begins in chapter 1 with a brief ethnographic description of the Yucatecan culture and the nature of the field research. The study compares speakers of English with speakers of Yucatec Maya, an indigenous Indian language of southeastern Mexico. Even though the present study will directly assess individual thought and behavior rather than cultural beliefs and institutions, some basic background in the Yucatec Maya culture is necessary to understand the linguistic analysis and the cognitive assessment. This ethnographic sketch provides this background; it is not intended to be a full-scale cultural analysis.
A detailed explication and analytic contrast of the grammatical patterns of the two languages follows in chapter 2. The goal of linguistic analysis in the present case is to develop a description of a morphosyntactic contrast between English and Yucatec suitable for generating a specific cognitive hypothesis. This involves providing a description of the relevant forms in each language, a meaningful comparison and characterization of the differences, and a way to link the differences to some testable cognitive hypothesis. The category chosen for the present study is that of nominal number. The chapter explains the reasons for selecting this category, provides the relevant descriptive material on the two languages, and contrasts them within a multilanguage framework.
Nominal number as conceptualized here encompasses a variety of ways of marking "number" in the noun phrase and includes both singular-plural distinctions which are obligatory in English and certain modifier forms known as numeral classifiers which are obligatory in Yucatec. Nominal number marking of some sort is frequently used and structurally obligatory in the two languages at issue, thus maximizing the potential for psychological impact from both quantitative and qualitative points of view. Since nominal number frequently has indexical referential value, it is a suitable category in terms of implementing a referential anchor for linguistic comparison. Because it is routinely associated with lexical nouns that themselves can have indexical refer-

4

Grammatical categories and cognition

ential value, it permits the use of pictures and objects as experimental stimuli. Finally, nominal number has been either directly or indirectly involved in nearly all the previous empirical research on the linguistic relativity hypothesis that has dealt with grammar. Thus, by working with nominal number, the present research also addresses the substantive issues raised in the studies by Whorf, Lee, Mathiot, Hoijer, Brown, Casagrande, Maclay, and Bloom which were discussed in Language diversity and thought.
The basic formal regularities of nominal number marking are first described for each language. Number marking interacts with the referential content of the lexical noun, with other morphosyntactic categories, with patterns of adjectival modification, etc. The description is focused primarily on the linguistic variables pertinent to the cognitive work to follow but tries to take account of the more significant of these reactances, especially where they suggest a broad, systematic configuration of meaning. In the case of Yucatec, which will not be familiar to most readers, the description of number marking patterns is preceded by a brief description of the global typological characteristics of the language.
These patterns of number marking in English and Yucatec are then contrasted so as to identify similarities and differences. The contrast focuses initially on formal-functional analogues between the two languages. This preliminary contrast is then situated within a broader comparative understanding of number marking patterns, drawing in particular on available linguistic typologies of noun phrase types. The Yucatec-English contrast is then restated in more neutral and precise terms by taking advantage of this broader, comparatively informed perspective. The resulting linguistic description also suggests immediately how other languages can be incorporated into future research.
Finally, the design, execution, and results from the various cognitive assessment tasks are reported in chapter 3. The goal of the cognitive assessment is to identify patterns of habitual thought in the two language groups that could plausibly stem from corresponding differences in the morphosyntactic treatment of nominal number. Habitual thought will be inferred from patterns of attention, memory, and classification exhibited by samples of individuals from both groups engaging in two series of diagnostic task procedures involving identical materials. Even though some naturalistic evidence for habitual thought patterns will also be mentioned, these specially designed, experimentally controlled tasks will provide the crucial evidence for language effects in this study.
The discussion begins by explaining the cognitive implications derived from the linguistic patterns. One set of implications is drawn directly from a straightforward analysis of typical overt referential values. A second set of implications is drawn from considering the underlying

Introduction 5
(covert) referential values suggested by the configurational logic of each system. A crucial goal is to indicate how these cognitive implications are distinct from the linguistic regularities themselves.
The derivation of implications is followed by a lengthy discussion of the development and logic of the tasks and materials used in the first task series. Included here is a systematic procedure for the comparison of languages on nominal number patterns, a discussion of the rationale for, and development of, the stimulus materials, and an explanation of the various task procedures. The discussion is quite lengthy because the materials and procedures are themselves complex and because they have been explicitly developed for ease of extension to new languages which may exhibit significantly different regularities.
As discussed in Language diversity and thought, there are many differences in the behavior of Yucatecan and US samples and many cultural patterns that can potentially account for any given behavioral difference. The various strategies proposed in the final chapter of Language diversity and thought such as the use of very specific and highly group-characteristic predictions and the use of multiple means of assessment have been implemented here to help make alternative interpretations of the data implausible. And since, as just mentioned, the assessment procedures have been developed in such a way that they can be readily extended to additional language groups, it will be possible to evaluate any competing hypotheses in future work.
The cognitive section continues with a second task series which focuses on the underlying cognitive implications of the most striking difference between Yucatec and English number marking. The assessment procedure has been designed to maximize information on this difference and so has not yet been generalized for use with other language groups. However, the results of this experiment provide unusually compelling evidence for language effects, clarify the interlocking nature of lexical and syntactic meaning, and suggest a number of interesting lines of future research.
The conclusion in chapter 4 briefly evaluates the success of the empirical project, contrasts the approach with previous approaches, and makes suggestions for future research.

1. Background of the comparative research in Yucatan, Mexico
Effective comparative investigation of the linguistic relativity hypothesis requires direct linguistic, ethnographic, and psychological research in two or more cultures. The present study is based on such research conducted among middle-class Americans and among the Mayan people of Yucatan, Mexico. This chapter provides general background on salient elements of the Yucatecan cultural context since these are likely to be unfamiliar to most readers. Some general comments on the course of the foreign fieldwork and sequence of task administration are also included.
Background on the Yucatec Maya culture
This section provides schematic information about the Yucatecan culture and community where the comparative research was conducted. The account places the rural Yucatecan village culture within the larger array of world cultures and within the Mexican national scene by characterizing its history and social organization in very global terms. Specific details are added where necessary to indicate how the particular village differs from the general Yucatecan pattern, to facilitate interpreting the stimulus materials described in chapter 3, and to highlight salient contrasts with American culture.
History and social geography
The Mayan people of concern in this study are resident in a small rural village in the state of Yucatan in southeastern Mexico. Historically, they are related to the ancient Mayan peoples whose civilization was predominant throughout the region during the pre-Columbian era. This ancient Mayan civilization reached its zenith in a "Classic" period running from

8

Grammatical categories and cognition

approximately AD 300 through AD 900, during which time achievements in the arts and sciences reached a level unexcelled by any other native culture of the New World. This civilization was in decline at the time of the arrival of the first Spanish conquistadors and the subsequent military and religious conquest destroyed most of the remaining "high" culture. However the folk culture, by which is meant the customary beliefs and practices of the great bulk of the people, survived far longer, eventually becoming integrated with elements of colonial Spanish and, later, modern Mexican culture, as a distinctive regional "Yucatecan" culture. It is this regional Yucatecan culture which constitutes the villagers' world both in practical and in conceptual terms, and which forms the background for the present study.1
The study was conducted in a village with about 700 people in the Chemax district which lies on the eastern border of the state of Yucatan. (Historical present for this description of the village is 1978.) The village lies in a traditional, corn-farming area which encircles Valladolid (population 50,000), Yucatan's second largest town and the commercial, political, and social center for the eastern region. In many respects the area is one of the last remaining enclaves of extremely traditional culture in the Yucatan peninsula region. To the north is a booming commercial and cattle growing area, around the town of Tizimin. To the west is Yucatan's henequen zone, where henequen (used in making sisal rope products) is grown in a plantation-style agricultural system; Merida, the state capital and source of contact with the outside world, lies in the center of this henequen zone. To the south and west is a region similar in its conservatism to the Valladolid region but which historically has had closer ties to Merida and, therefore, the outside world. The population of this southwestern region has recently become increasingly dependent on a variety of cash crops other than corn. Southeast and east are extensive forests which have been a major source of the chicle used in making chewing gum but which have been logged extensively for timber in recent years. Further to the east on the Caribbean coast is the newly developed resort region of Cancun whose beaches and waters attract thousands of tourists every year.2
Historically, contact with the outside world for the villagers required a day's journey by foot or on horseback to Valladolid. Chemax, the local district capital a half day's journey away, was merely a larger version of the village with the addition of a few civil and clerical officials. Merida, the state capital and true locus of peninsular power, exerted its influence through Valladolid and few villagers ever visited it. In the last decade, with the construction of many new roads and with the development of the Cancun resort with its new employment opportunities, village contact with the outside world has increased considerably. For some, Cancun

Background of the comparative research 9
now rivals Valladolid as the most important place outside the village. And for everyone a trip by truck to Valladolid is now a several-times-ayear event, though it is still a notable and exciting event for most. Practical opportunity for outside contact, however, has not always been met by village interest, and, for most residents, the village is still central and the rest of the world either unknown or irrelevant to daily life. Most are happy to live where they do and leave for more than a short trip only when need requires and even then with some reluctance.
Material culture
The journey to the village from Valladolid involves a two hour ride in the back of a three-ton pickup truck which travels thefirsthalf of the trip on a modern paved road and the second half on a narrow all-weather gravel road. Truck transport came to the village some years ago (c. 1972) and has transformed village life by allowing aflowof goods and people to and from the outside world on a scale not possible before. En route, along the road through the scrub jungle, are small individual ranches and farms belonging to private landowners. When the truck eventually arrives at the village, one first sees the new school buildings on the edge of town and then two long lines of huts along the street to the town square. The town square is large and perfectly flat, dominated in the center by a tall colonial church (c. 1780) and rimmed on three sides with more thatched huts. The fourth side is bordered by a row of single-story masonry buildings: the original school building and a town hall. It is in front of these buildings that the truck stops, depositing its cargo and passengers, some of whom will continue on by foot or horseback to more remote ranches and villages.
From the top of the church, one can see an expanse of perfectly flat, intensely green jungle stretching off in all directions to the horizon; even houses in the village are not visible beyond the first block or so, being concealed by tall trees. Although the square is roughly rectangular, the town's 150 lots are scattered in a lopsided grid pattern towards the east and north, the directions in which lie most of the men'sfields.House lots are typically 50 by 50 meters square and contain one or two oval or rectangular shaped structures made of poles and roofed with thatch (or, in recent years, with thick corrugated tar paper). Some of these structures are houses which are from 3 by 4 meters up to about 4 by 8 meters in size. House floors are made of dirt, sometimes packed over a layer of gravel or small rocks. Additional buildings in the yards provide extra sleeping space, storage, or serve other special functions. Front and back doors are made either of planks with hinges (signifying wealth and/or

10 Grammatical categories and cognition
modernity) or of woven vine (signifying poverty and/or conservatism); houses have no windows. Yards are fenced with rock walls from two to three feet high which mark yard boundaries and supposedly keep animals in or out. (In fact, there are animals everywhere - in streets, yards, and houses.) All water is drawn with rope, pulley, and bucket from wells or natural sink holes which reach the water table. Yard and forest serve as latrine. There is no electricity: wood is burned for heat and cooking, candles and kerosene serve to provide light.
Life is simple in terms of material possessions. Furniture consists of short stools about six to eight inches (15-20 cm.) high made of hewn logs and of short tables about eighteen inches (50 cm.) high used for cooking. Most families also have one large table about thirty inches (75 cm.) high and three feet (1 m.) long which is used to work at standing up and as an altar during special religious events. Often there is a foot treadle sewing machine in the house, in which case modern chairs of standard size are also present since they are needed to sit at the machine. Cooking is done over afireencircled by three stones which support pots, cooking griddle, etc. Most utensils are made of natural products (e.g., baskets, gourd bowls, etc.) but some are purchased: most families have some ceramic bowls or plates to use on special occasions; pots are enameled steel; ladles are aluminum or steel. Eating utensils are not used; corn tortillas serve in place of fork and spoon. Sleeping is done in hammocks hung from the support beams of the house. And most houses have trunks, suitcases, or cardboard boxes which serve to store each family member's three to six sets of clothing. Clothing is washed in wooden or cement wash tubs in the yard.3
Social organization
The village is an ejido. This means that the residents and their descendants have petitioned for and been given land collectively and in perpetuity by the national government as an outgrowth of a system of traditional land distribution re-established during the revolution earlier in this century. In rotation, men serve as head (comisario) of the ejido organization and the men who farm in the village (i.e., all adult men) serve as a committee of the whole in making decisions about matters involving the community. Each man receives from the ejido organization a right to cultivate a certain amount of land each year. In return, he is responsible for doing his share in the upkeep of the ejido: annual cutting of the ejido boundary line, serving guard duty (guardia) for the town square, performing communal labor (fajina/fagina) (for example, weeding the town square, roofing the schoolhouse), etc. Although not all

Background of the comparative research 11
of these activities are actually mandated by the ejido rules of Mexico, there is no real distinction among projects for the villagers: communal projects are decided on by consensus in public meetings (asambleas), and everyone is obliged to work upon whatever is agreed upon.4 A second structure of civil authority comes through the state and district (municipio) structure, but it is much less important and involves settling minor disputes such as theft and soliciting funds from state and federal agencies for help with town projects. Beyond these two structures, there are no formal organizations that include all members of the community.
The family is the locus of economic and religious activity. The basic family unit consists of a man, a woman, and their children. Marriage partners may be drawn from within or from outside the village, and both patterns commonly occur. Wedding expenses, which can be considerable, are borne by the man's family. Dissolution of marriage is rare after the first year except by death. Remarriage is common in such a case if the survivor is young.
At marriage, the woman moves to the house of her husband and his parents. Women effectively become part of the man's family for a time. (Women and their families prefer she find a marriage partner from within the village so she can remain close; men and their families prefer he find a marriage partner from outside the village since such a woman will more readily and fully integrate into the new family.) A new wife is trained (or rather, re-trained) by her mother-in-law in the proper performance of household chores and in childrearing. The couple continues to live with the husband's parents until their own family grows to the point where it is appropriate to set up their own household unit - usually when they have two or more children. Traditionally, these new household units established by a man's sons were all spatially near if not adjacent to his own. As the village population increases, this is no longer always possible.
Children carry the surnames of both father and mother although the father's name is most often used and is the only one passed on to the next generation. Fertility is high and families are large, although historically childhood disease took its toll and served to limit population growth; six living children is the norm for a mature couple, although ten or more children may actually have been born. With the arrival of modern medicine, child mortality has declined and the population is now growing much more rapidly. The elderly are cared for by their children, especially the youngest son and his spouse.
The widespread Latin pattern of godparenthood (compadrazgo) is practiced but is not emphasized as much as elsewhere; baptismal godparents are the most important as they will care for children should the parents (in particular, the mother) die.5

Work and leisure
Village life centers on corn farming and associated religious practices. All village men cultivate corn in a swidden (slash-and-burn) system. During fall and winter men fell a section of the jungle. In spring they burn off the now dry timber and, when the rains come, they sow the field. During summer they weed thefields(the most taxing of their chores) and in August they harvest their crop. In the same fields with the corn they grow squashes, tubers, and beans as secondary crops and these four items constitute the bulk of their diet - with corn comprising by far the greatest portion. Most men do not go to their fields every day, taking time each week to build or make needed objects (for example, tables, washtubs, bee hives, raised garden platforms, etc.), maintain the house and yard, travel to town, perform communal labor, etc. All or most of Sunday is taken as a day of rest.
Extra corn beyond that needed for subsistence is grown by nearly all men. This corn is either sold for cash or used to feed animals (turkeys, chickens, pigs) which, in turn, may themselves be eaten or sold for cash. Many men also keep colonies of honeybees which provide another source of cash. Most families also have gardens in their yards in which they have fruit trees and some vegetables; these are usually consumed domestically, but are also sold for cash by some. When the corn crop is insufficient or when expenses are unusually high (due to illness, planned marriage, etc.), men seek wage labor either by working in their neighbors' fields or by going away, usually to Cancun where they work carrying water for masons building the tourist hotels.
While the man is in the field, the woman is also performing a taxing round of daily chores. Twice each day she must prepare corn for grinding and two or three times she must prepare meals. When not engaged in food preparation, she usually is washing clothes, drawing the water used in bathing, cooking, and irrigating the garden, or gathering firewood (this last is a job also done by children and men). She also spends a lot of time watching children and supervising the work and caretaking responsibilities of the older children. Women's work is continuous and long. Just preparing corn to eat involves many hours and many steps: husking the ears, shucking the dried kernels, drawing water, boiling the corn with lime, rinsing the boiled corn three or more times, taking the corn to the motor-driven grinding mill (hand grinding was supplanted many years ago), and finally making by hand and cooking over a wood fire the dozens of tortillas to be consumed at each meal. As with the men, corn is the center of daily life for women.
Of the 156 men in the community, very few (the elderly aside) do not farm corn for themselves. Four of those who do not are brothers: one is a

Background of the comparative research 13
butcher; one is the driver of the truck that goes to Valladolid once each day; one runs a store, operates a corn grinding mill, and owns a cattle ranch; and the fourth does very little if anything. Two other men cannot work in the fields for medical reasons and hence make money through stores and butchering. There are a few other men in the village who supplement their farming by performing other services. Three men own corn grinding machines; several have a small stock of "store" goods which they sell to their neighbors at a markup; one man does carpentry of a simple sort (for example, making chairs, doors, and coffins); one man is a tailor; one man is learning to be a mason; and one man serves as a "doctor" in his capacity as a trained representative of the federal rural health-care program dispensing drugs and shots. Five men say prayers at special events in exchange for food, but this is more a ritual responsibility undertaken from a sense of duty or a desire for prestige rather than as a money making activity. Women specialists include a woman who represents the rural health-care program in matters of pregnancy and child health care, two traditional mid-wives, a few women who sew or embroider especially well make clothing for their neighbors, and three women who serve as cooks at large social gatherings which is a ritual responsibility carrying considerable prestige but negligible economic benefit. All of these occupations are sidelines to the main business of farming and domestic maintenance. In recent years, government programs to expand agricultural opportunities have led to the organization of groups for more extensive vegetable farming, bee raising, and hardwood production, but these have yet to establish themselves as long-term and productive income sources, and no one really relies on them yet.6
Leisure activities such as dancing, bull fighting, visiting, drinking and eating special food are primarily associated with the religious activities that are discussed in the next section. Villagers also engage in a variety of secular recreational activities such as hunting, playing baseball (which may involve a trip to a neighboring town), and watching movies. Finally they engage in many small diversions such as simply watching activities in the village, gossiping and joking, card playing (mostly young men), visiting neighbors and relatives, and listening to the radio.
Religion
Religion dominates all aspects of village life. The religious practices represent a creative fusion of colonial Catholic and pre-Columbian native belief. Central to nearly all the religious activities is the theme of inviting the gods to come and share a meal with the participants; hence,

14 Grammatical categories and cognition
food offerings predominate in any religious setting. There are religious beliefs and practices associated with each stage in the agricultural cycle; with various points or periods in the life-cycle; with various days of the year associated with patron saints or with anniversaries of recent deaths and the like; and with illnesses, emergencies, or times of need. On any given day there is almost sure to be some religious activity somewhere in the community. Some of the observances are private, family affairs, some encompass small groups of families, and still others involve nearly all villagers and even persons from neighboring villages.
Work, social status, recreation, courtship, and general worldview are all implicated in the religious system. Most surplus wealth eventually ends up being spent on religious observances in one way or another and to some extent status is linked to the amount spent sponsoring religious events. Events associated with religious observances - food preparation and meals, small gatherings of worshipers, dances, bullfights, etc. constitute the bulk of organized recreational social life in the village and, from the native point of view, constitute the highlights of a given day, week, or year. It is these events which are looked forward to and which provide relief from the monotony of the daily round.
For most of this religious activity the village is self sufficient. The Catholic clergy is needed and thought of only for baptisms, marriages, and an occasional mass (which occurs about four times each year). Even in these ceremonies, the follow-up activities in the households once the priest has gone constitute the more significant elements in the minds of the villagers. Here public nervousness and a certain blind formality give way to religious care and deep belief.7
Language, education, and intellectual life
Maya is the language of the village. Only a handful of men are truly bilingual in Spanish, although most men know enough Spanish to interact with government officials, Valladolid shopkeepers, and Cancun employers - and it is usually in these contexts that Spanish is spoken. Men between the ages of 20 and 30 (i.e., who have reached adulthood since the coming of the road and the development of the tourist resort), speak more and better Spanish on the whole, as a result of having worked outside the village. Very few women know much Spanish; most can be characterized as monolingual with supplemental Spanish phrases and vocabulary. In fact, many Spanish lexical items have essentially become part of Maya, accepting Maya verbal and nominal inflectional patterns, and are not distinguished by native speakers from indigenous Maya. Many shopkeepers and doctors in Valladolid (traditionally the major

Background of the comparative research 15
point of extra-village contact) require their employees to know Maya, and hence people who know only Maya can live in a more or less monolingual environment.
Education in the village is of two kinds: formal and informal. Formal education in the school system is provided by a federal agency especially concerned with indigenous peoples which sends in teachers each week to the village. The first two or three grades are taught in Maya with Maya materials; thereafter, the attempted transition to Spanish is instituted, but even in the upper grades, Maya is used heavily. There are six grades available in the village; further education entails leaving the village for a boarding school run by the same federal agency. Most children probably go to school once in a while, but less than half attend seriously and only a small minority attend beyond the third grade. Prior to the coming of the road, teachers came irregularly, infrequently, or both, hence many older people have no education at all; many men cannot sign their own name or read simple printed signs. Those adult men who can read derive some prestige from that fact and are more likely to serve in the higher public offices and to run stores. They may also take up official prayer reading, which involves reading the prayers appropriate for a given occasion or day for other members of the community. In recent years the school has become an important source of new information in the village, but this has more to do with the efforts of a few dedicated and enlightened directors and teachers than with any general influence of school as an institution.
An informal education is provided by parents and by general exposure to life in the village. There are few pre-made toys and little parental attention to children's play activities; but with sticks, leaves, tin cans, etc. the children do play and explore their world. All children from the age of four onward are liable to be given a younger sibling to take care of; this duty lasts off and on until the older child becomes more valuable in other chores. By age six or seven the young boy begins to help his father in the field in small ways and slowly he makes the transition by late teens to a self-sufficient farmer. Young girls begin helping their mothers at about the same age with water drawing and other simple chores and later move on to learn cooking and other skills by their late teens.
The intellectual demands of village life are not high. Few of the tasks in the culture are conceptually difficult and complex, but there is plenty of time to master these and all young adults are competent in the basics by age twenty. There is no stigma to slow learning, and people are ready to laugh at themselves and others when they can't learn easily; but there is great stigma to not knowing what one should do or in not doing well something all men and women are expected to do perfectly. Such overlearning of basic skills brings its own sort of social pressure: failure

16 Grammatical categories and cognition
can correctly be ascribed to lack of effort, not ability. Because of this overlearned aspect of intellectual tasks, it is often difficult to pick out individual differences at first. But with time onefindsthat some are more efficient in their activities and that some are adding new skills beyond the basics even as adults. Differences show up, too, in ability to calculate or estimate sums in one's head, to make and understand jokes, and to deal with novel situations. The most striking difference from the perspective of the familiar modern situation in the West is the general absence of certain sophisticated individually held intellectual skills (for example, ability to do mental multiplication). The society in many ways is structured to minimize dependence on such individual intellectual skills. For example, people need not do extensive mathematical computations when shopping in the stores since items are purchased one at a time: you ask for what you want, ask its price, pay the price, get your change, and then go on to buy the next item after checking with the shopkeeper that your funds are sufficient. Only the storekeeper needs to be routinely capable of making change correctly at the simplest level. (Consequently, in the trade town of Valladolid, villagers depend very much on a shopkeeper's honesty, and successive generations of people go to the same stores in part because of trust in these shopkeepers and their families.) As this example shows, social routines effectively substitute for complex, individual intellectual procedures of mental calculation.
However, some responsibility for specific knowledge does rest with the individual and people retain elaborate quantities of information. A particularly notable example is the nearly universal ability to recall exactly the price paid for many personal or household items - even years after the date of purchase. This information is widely discussed and the information serves as some protection against overcharge when the individual travels alone to town to make a purchase from shops where prices are never posted.8
Information on fieldwork and task administration
Site selection
The decision to work with the Yucatec Mayan people (as opposed to some other group) was guided in the first place by several practical methodological requirements. Principal considerations were proximity to the United States given the expectation that multiplefieldvisits would be needed, widespread use of a non-Indo-European language, a relatively stable cultural situation, and a wider context of political stability. Subsequent to these considerations, the availability of prior ethno-

Background of the comparative research 17
graphic and linguistic research on the area was decisive given the specific topical focus of the research. Before undertaking thefieldportion of the project, a considerable amount of background research was conducted on the language and culture so that morefieldtime would be available to take up particular research topics.
Similar methodological (or logistical) factors influenced the selection of a site within Yucatan. Ample size of village was important in providing a large enough sample of individuals, especially when some control over age or sex might be necessary. Size was also a consideration in terms of finding housing. An upper limit on acceptable size however was presented by the fact that only smaller villages were as culturally and linguistically conservative as was desired. Maya language dominance (rather than Spanish) was a crucial factor. Cultural conservatism was deemed important to minimize the complicating factors associated with modernization. The village met all of these requirements.
Timing and focus of field research
The fieldwork itself was conducted over a three-year period from December 1977 through December 1980 during which time three separate trips to the field site were made. Intervals between field stays were used for analysis of data and preparation of materials for the next stage of the research.
During the first and longest stay (twenty months in Mexico, seventeen in the village) basic ethnographic and linguistic research was conducted. The ethnographic goal was a basic understanding of community life, that is the people, objects, activities, and ideas which were part of the round of daily life. The existence of particularly good descriptive material on the culture (for example, Redfield and Villa Rojas, 1934) greatly facilitated understanding during this early period despite an initial language barrier. Residence in the village and participation in its activities provided the personal background necessary for an operative (as opposed to abstract) understanding of the details of village life.
It soon became apparent that each individual acted with great independence in most spheres of Mayan social life. It was not possible therefore to gain the confidence of one person (or some few persons) of importance and thereby obtain the cooperation of the many individuals necessary for a systematic project. It was necessary, in short, to befriend each person individually and an enormous amount of time was spent therefore developing personal ties with as many villagers as possible. Although such friendship was a prerequisite of future cooperation as an informant, it was in no way a guarantee.

18 Grammatical categories and cognition
In addition to the usual ethnographic topics, considerable attention was paid to details which might prove of eventual value in the psychological portions of the work. These included, for example, degree of education, literacy, familiarity with photos and pictures of other sorts, and games. Degree of literacy was important not merely because of its obvious intellectual implications, but also because it was an index of comfortableness in working with written (including pictorial) materials.
The linguistic goals during this first trip included both gathering enough systematic data so as to be able to draw a contrastive linguistic comparison with English and becoming fluent enough in the language to use it comfortably for interviewing and for administering the various experimental procedures. Initial entry into the language was facilitated by the existence of good training and background materials (especially Blair and Vermont Salas, 1965). Daily contact with the language over many months provided the practice necessary to be able to speak the language easily.
Although a variety of grammatical topics were investigated in some detail, only a few seemed to be straightforwardly amenable to psychological assessment of the sort contemplated in this project. Greatest concentration, therefore, was directed toward these aspects of the grammar. A break after thefirstfieldstay provided the time necessary to refine the preliminary notions developed in the field setting and to make a contrastive analysis of English and Yucatec.
A second field trip in July and August 1980 was made to conduct more systematic assessment of certain details of the linguistic hypotheses which had been settled upon and to pretest various possible stimuli and task procedures for the nonlinguistic assessment. Following this trip, final experimental tasks and stimuli were prepared. During a third field visit in November and December 1980, the tasks reported here were administered to a group of Mayan men. Finally, during the first half of 1981, the same tasks were administered to a group of English-speaking American men. Additional work with these tasks and modified versions of them was undertaken in 1988 in the context of pilot work for a further study. These results are described here only when they help clarify problematic issues in the original study.
Administration of the experimental tasks
Two series of experimental tasks were administered to each group. The overall sequence of administration for each series is presented in table 1. The experiments in series 1, which concerned the referential range of certain body-part terms, will not be discussed here. However, this series

did serve (by design) to introduce speakers to the general format of experiments and to most of the specific task procedures as well. Thus, by the time they got to series 2, the tasks relevant to the current project, the men were familiar in a general way with most of the task requirements.9 Undoubtedly there remain substantial differences between the English and Yucatec samples in general familiarity with the experimental procedures typically used in cognitive studies, but it was hoped that the preliminary exposure to series 1 would help to minimize the significance of such differences on series 2 which followed.
The experiments were designed to provide a variety of types of information as shown schematically in table 2. Experiments 1,3,6, and 7 concerned immediate classification of stimuli (which, in the present case, included attention, categorization, and similarity judgment) whereas experiments 2, 4, and 5 concerned memory, that is, response to stimuli after a time delay. Experiments 1 and 2 provided systematic information on verbal responses both to verify linguistic patterns observed through less systematic techniques and to provide specific information on the verbal patterns associated with the stimulus materials to be used in the nonverbal experiments 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7. Experiments 3,4, and 5 provide information on performance using pictures as stimuli, in contrast to 6 and 7 which involve actual objects.

Mayan sample
Adult Mayan men from the village were asked to perform the tasks. These men ranged in age from 18 to 45+ years of age with fairly even representation across this span. Educational experience ranged from zero to three years. (Ages and years of education for older men are estimates.) The primary motivations for participation were personal friendship and curiosity. Althoughfinancialcompensation equal to a half day's wage was given, and was a decisive factor in a few cases, in no case was it alone sufficient.
The experiments were conducted in my house usually during daylight hours and the work was done at a small table at which we both sat. A portable procedure would have offered certain advantages (for example, I could have shown up at a man's house at an agreed upon time and by my presence help assure fulfillment of the commitment to participate), but the privacy available in my house outweighed these considerations. In general the men found the tasks interesting and easy - although some grew tired or bored by the last few experiments. Men coming in the morning tended to be more energetic and cheerful. However, those coming in the afternoon included more reliable and responsible men who would come only when the day's agricultural work was completed. Details of stimuli and task procedures are outlined below where the particular experiments are described.
The experiments (both series 1 and 2 together) took from 2 to 3 hours depending on the individual. This was an extraordinary amount of time for these men to be engaged in concentrated intellectual work, and it undoubtedly influenced their performance somewhat adversely. However, previous experience indicated that using a single session was

Background of the comparative research 21
the best approach for a variety of reasons. Like many cultural groups, the Maya do not put the same emphasis that we do on either temporal punctuality or verbal obligation. Thus, men would say that they would come at a certain time and then not come, or they would eventually show up hours later; alternatively, they would come as planned only to announce that they had other commitments. Secondly, by design the experiments were sequenced as to difficulty and order of exposure of certain stimuli so that a single administration was desirable. Finally, the desire to get equivalent data on all men argued for a uniform approach. By repeated advance visits on the day before or even a few hours before to reaffirm the commitment to come, by withholding the compensation until the entire series was completed, and by utilizing some verbal persuasion, it was possible to administer the tasks to about five men a week.
Questions can be raised about the willingness of Mayan men to participate, as this is a common difficulty in cross-cultural work of this sort. It should be emphasized that I had no special power over these men and that, by the time these experiments were administered, this was clear to everyone. The basic egalitarian norm of male interaction in the village, namely, that no man can or should coerce any other man, was operative for me and, I believe, made men comfortable in refusing to participate if they wished. Several did refuse. Men who were explicit about not wanting to participate were not asked again. There are a number of extremely subtle, indirect cues as to genuine interest which are too complicated to elaborate on here (for example, suggesting we do the task tomorrow signifies "I'm not interested," suggesting tomorrow at some specific time such as four o'clock signifies "I'm seriously interested"). Implicit refusals were also honored to the extent they were recognized. The most difficult situation, as indicated above, arose when a man failed to appear as agreed because this might indicate reluctance to participate, but could not, in and of itself, be taken as a reliable index of such reluctance. Some men genuinely forgot to come, others encountered more pressing demands on their time, and so forth. These are common occurrences in village life where neither the clock nor informal arrangements of the sort involved here count for much. In the end, some of the men who agreed to participate clearly showed some ambivalence about doing so. I believe their hesitancy was usually due either to uncertainty about what was required and/or insecurity about their skills in "bookwork." No one remained uncomfortable once the tasks were begun and they saw what was involved. Many wanted to come "work" again another time and have done so on subsequent field visits.

College-aged men from the University of Chicago were also asked to perform the tasks. All were native speakers of English. These men were all known to me from previous contact in the University housing system and the primary motivations for participation were personal friendship and curiosity. The tasks were administered in my apartment in an informal atmosphere using the same procedures as with the Maya. The men experienced no special difficulties with the tasks and usually completed them in about two hours. One or two men showed excessive concern with their performance - what might be called "test anxiety" but their patterns of performance were not noticeably different from those of the other men on the substantive measures reported below.

2. Comparison of grammatical categories: nominal number in English and Yucatec
Introduction
An examination of the relationship of linguistic diversity to thought requires the identification and analysis of a specific case of such diversity. Ideally, following Whorf, the contrast would be of large-scale "fashions of speaking." This ideal guides the approach taken here in two respects. First, the focus is on a structurally and semantically significant aspect of the grammar rather than on a little used or structurally marginal pattern. Second, some preliminary indications are given as to how these patterns fit together into larger semantic structures in each language.
It would also be desirable to investigate a substantial sample of languages. This is approximated here in that the linguistic characterizations and comparisons explicitly take account of typological data on an array of languages. Further, the analysis has been constructed, both methodologically and substantively, to facilitate extension to additional languages. However, detailed linguistic discussion will be provided only for American English and Yucatec Maya - the two languages for which cognitive assessments will be undertaken.
The phenomenon of concern in this chapter can be loosely labeled in traditional terms as nominal number marking. Notionally, it involves various indications of the multiplicity, number, quantity, or amount of some object of noun phrase reference relative to a predication. Formally, it includes such things as plural inflection, plural concord, and indication of singular or plural by modification of the lexical head of a noun phrase with a numeral or other adjective indicating quantity or specificity of amount. Nominal number has been chosen for several reasons. First, it is one of the most commonly encountered and most central noun phrase categories; as such it is ideal for comparative purposes. Secondly, in many cases the formal patterns have clear referential value, an important consideration from the point of view of developing controlled language comparisons and nonlinguistic cognitive assessment procedures. Finally,
23

24 Grammatical categories and cognition
it is the locus of some of the more striking differences between the structure of English and that of Yucatec.
The primary goal of this chapter is to describe and interpret the basic contrasts in number marking between English and Yucatec from which a meaningful cognitive analysis can be developed. The approach taken is to sketch first the number marking patterns of the two languages in broad terms, showing the place of the specific patterns of interest within the larger pattern of number marking and the general grammatical organization. In the case of Yucatec, a brief general introductory sketch of the language in terms of some standard typological categories is also included. These descriptions are then followed by an explicit comparison of the two languages on the major points of difference - bringing in additional comparative information and perspectives to clarify the interpretation. The chapter concludes with a brief summary statement of the major patterns of differences.
Any given linguistic utterance represents the intersection of a number of complex functional levels into a single formal representation. Inversely, each individual form within an utterance may simultaneously play a role at several of these functional levels or even several roles within a single level. This multifunctionality of speech forms lies at the heart of the difficulties of linguistic analysis. The present analysis by being focused as it is on only one subsection of the grammar - number marking - must necessarily simplify (hence, distort) some aspects of the actual patterning of the two languages. Yet if all the meanings of a formal pattern, all the formal manifestations a given meaning may take, or all the interactions the form-meaning combinations undergo were explored, one would inevitably be led away from the original focus of research to a description of the structure of the entire grammar. Such a comprehensive grammatical description is not the goal of this chapter. Further, it will also become evident during the discussion that there are substantial difficulties with the traditional characterization of number marking itself. Although some indications are given as to the direction a reconceptualization might take, a full theoretical reworking will not be undertaken here.
Description of English
Overview of English noun phrases
The focus of the present analysis will be on number marking as part of the constitution of a noun phrase. A noun phrase forms part of a proposition (clause or sentence) which is, in turn, usually part of a longer utterance in

Comparison of grammatical categories 25
a sequence of discourse consisting of many linked propositions. The category of number functions significantly at these higher structural levels, aiding in the establishment and maintenance of coherent discourse. So these levels, although they are not the focus, must also play a role in the analysis.
The emphasis here will be on lexical noun phrases. A lexical noun phrase consists of a phrase with a lexical noun as its endocentric head and may include various modifiers. The head noun itself may be intrinsically a noun (i.e., a noun root), may be derived from a non-noun root (for example, verb root), or may be formally neutral (for example, becoming a noun or verb with equal facility). The derivational processes which essentially convert non-nominal material into nouns may be signaled by morphological marks or may consist merely of placement in a noun phrase framework. The head noun may be modified in various ways either by inflectional processes (usually affixation) with various grammatical categories (for example, number), by lexical modification (for example, determiners, quantifiers, and descriptive adjectives), or by various phrasal and clausal modifiers. Various pronominal forms which necessarily index some element of the immediate speech situation (for example, personal pronouns, demonstratives, etc.) can function as full noun phrases from a formal point of view without involving a lexical noun. However, some of the grammatical categories (especially inflectional categories) applied to or characteristic of lexical noun phrases also receive explicit marking in these pronominal forms (for example, pronouns may differentiate number and gender).
Overt indications of grammatical number
Lexical content versus grammatical number
Some lexical nouns indicate a multiplicity of referents as part of their inherent referential meaning. So for example herd refers to an aggregation of animals and people refers to more than one person. Although such lexical indications interact with grammatical number, they are not equivalent to it. Thus herd may take both singular and plural number marking to indicate the number of herds (for example, one herd, three herds, etc.); the existence of a multiplicity of animals within the aggregation is grammatically irrelevant in this construction. People likewise can function in this way (for example, taking a plural as in the peoples of the earth are threatened), but in other situations the inherent multiplicity of the lexical meaning will be reflected in grammatical number marking patterning (for example, plural verb agreement with nonplural lexical

26 Grammatical categories and cognition
noun: the people of the earth are threatened, a people are united by their traditions, people are angry, etc.).
The interaction of grammatical number with inherent lexical content is a central concern of this chapter. For this reason, the initial account of the number marking patterns in English will be made without reference to the lexical content of the noun head. Care has not always been taken on this point in traditional grammatical accounts. It is quite common to use a given pattern of number marking to sort or define lexical nouns into classes (for example, nouns that can take plural inflection are "count" nouns, those that cannot are "mass" nouns). Then the lexical division is used to explain the application of number marking (for example, this noun can be pluralized because it is a "count" noun). The circularity here is quite clear. This purely formal approach provides no explanatory value in the absence of some notional grounding outside the circle. One alternative is to characterize the lexical content of the nouns independently of number marking and number marking independently of specific lexical content and, only then, to analyze the interactions.
Marking noun phrase number by inflection
Plural is a basic inflectional category of English lexical noun phrases. Individual lexical nouns typically take a plural suffix -s (âes) to refer to a multiplicity of referents - hence the traditional notional interpretation of the category as having to do with number. The nature of the multiplicity depends on the meaning of the lexical noun; two meanings predominate: multiplicity of a recurrent unit (for example, pens) and multiplicity of various kinds (for example, wines). Lexical nouns without such a mark (i.e., no suffix or "zero" suffix [-0]) are frequently interpreted as being "singular," that is, as necessarily having reference to a single unit or kind, but in fact they need not be. Many nouns cannot be inflected for plural nor take plural meaning (for example, zinc, heat); it is misleading then to call these lexical forms singular to the extent that doing so suggests a specific sense of "singularity" in formal opposition with plural. All other things being equal, that is, in the absence of some other indication of number, the lexical forms without -s are best interpreted as being nonplural from the point of view of number.
Singular, then, is not an inflectional category in English. If there is an overt indication of singularity it lies elsewhere in the noun phrase or clause. However, for most nouns the nonplural form of a lexical noun will be the one used to form noun phrases with Singular meaning and thus, in many cases, "singular" is a plausible residual interpretation of the number of these lexical nouns. It will be important in what follows to distinguish clearly between nonplural form of the lexical noun and the

Comparison of grammatical categories 27
Singular number marking of the noun phrase as a whole. To indicate this difference orthographically, the capitalized terms Plural, Singular, and Neutral will be used to designate the overall number value of the noun phrase; uncapitalized forms such as plural and nonplural will be used to refer to the value of specific markings within the utterance.
Many lexical nouns in English depart from this basic inflectional pattern. They show irregularities in the formation of the plural form often because of the preservation of an older plural marking form (for example, ox versus oxen) or because of the foreign origin of the lexeme (for example, criterion versus criteria). The characterization of these forms as plurals depends on both an understanding of their usual referential meaning and on the fact that the forms themselves pattern in certain ways like ordinary plurals. Even so, the very fact of their irregularity is a clue that there may be something unusual about the typical meaning of these nouns. Sometimes both the ordinary and an irregular plural coexist leading to three-way oppositions with special semantic senses for the irregular forms: brother, brothers, brethren.
Marking noun phrase number by modification1
Lexical nouns may be modified in English by a variety of adjectival forms which precede the noun in the following general sequence: determiners (including articles, quantitative determiners, demonstratives, possessives), quantifiers (including ordinal numbers, cardinal numbers, and certain phrasal forms indicating groupings, partitives, and measures), and qualifiers or descriptive adjectives (including everything else). Determiners consist of a relatively small set of frequently used forms some of which can show agreement with, or mark the number of, the lexical noun head and, from a syntactic point of view, act much like the head of a noun phrase (Lyons, 1977, sees. 11.4, 15.2). Quantitative adjectives comprise a moderately large set of lexical forms which interact with, and directly indicate the number of, the lexical noun. Qualitative adjectives comprise a large set of lexical forms which interact with number indirectly by the information they provide about the inherent lexical meaning of nouns. This discussion will concentrate for the most part on determiners and quantitative adjectives.
Determiners
Indefinite article and similar forms. The indefinite article a {âan) occupies an interstitial status between determiner and quantitative adjective. Along with certain other forms it is sometimes referred to as a

28 Grammatical categories and cognition
quantitative determiner. It is in structural alternation with other determiners, but means 'one' or 'singularity'. Historically, a apparently derives from an, Anglo Saxon numeral 'one' and the full form one emerges in deictic and anaphoric uses: give me one. This indefinite article form thus signals singular and, when occurring with a nonplural lexical noun head, is one of the most important indications of Singular meaning within the noun phrase as a whole. For example, the nonplural lexical noun cake when preceded by article a produces Singular noun phrase: / ate a cake. This can be readily distinguished from a Neutral noun phrase where number is not positively specified and therefore is neither Singular or Plural (for example, / ate [some] cake) and, of course, from a Plural noun phrase (for example, / ate [two] cakes). Several other forms also mark Singular noun phrases in the same fashion as the indefinite article: every, each, either, neither.
Other indefinite forms. The absence of the indefinite article or similar form, that is, when the determiner is 0 (phonological zero), a nonsingular lexical noun is indicated. It can occur with a plural lexical noun to form a Plural noun phrase (for example, He brought cookies) or with a nonplural lexical noun to form a Neutral noun phrase (for example, He brought wine). Table 3 shows how the plural/nonplural alternation in inflectional patterning interacts with the singular/nonsingular patterning of the quantitative determiners to yield a three-way patterning of number at the noun phrase level. Several other forms also mark nonsingular noun phrases in the same fashion as 0 (phonological zero): some (unstressed), any (unstressed), and enough. These forms can stand alone in anaphoric or deictic uses.
Definite article and similar forms. Number is not signalled by the definite article the: I ate the cake, I ate the cakes. Other determiner or determiner-like forms that are neutral with respect to number are the possessives his, her, its, etc., some (stressed), any (stressed), no, and various w/i-forms (whose, which, whichever, etc.). These forms can stand alone in deictic or anaphoric uses.
Demonstratives. Demonstratives agree with the number of the lexical noun head: this cake, that cake, these cakes, those cakes. So demonstratives do not modify the number of the lexical noun, that is, they apparently do not contribute to creating number at the level of the noun phrase. However, they can be diagnostic of number in ambiguous cases for noun phrases headed by irregular lexical nouns. Like other determiners, these forms can stand alone in deictic or anaphoric uses.

Quantitative modifiers
Quantitative modifiers generally involve explicit or implicit mention of number and usually can follow a determiner such as the. In general the quantifier modifiers indicate either singular or plural number. A couple of forms can be used either way.
Ordinal indicators. Ordinal modifiers include the true ordinals first, second, third, etc. and certain forms which resemble them semantically and grammatically such as next, last, another, additional, other, main, precise. The true ordinals other thanfirstrequire a nonplural lexical noun and indicate singular as part of their meaning. First allows a broader range of meanings and does not reliably distinguish number. The remaining ordinals other than last and another are also compatible with either plural or nonplural lexical nouns, but with the nonplural nouns they all indicate singular as part of their meaning. Last like first allows a broader range of meanings especially when referring to temporal ordering and therefore does not reliably distinguish number. Another usually co-occurs with a nonplural noun and signals singular. We may generalize that ordinals tend to exclude a meaning of Neutral at the level of the noun phrase.
Cardinal indicators. Cardinal indicators include the true cardinals one, two, three, etc. and certain forms which resemble them semantically and grammatically such as many, few, several, only. One occurs with nonplural lexical nouns and inherently indicates singular by its meaning. With one exception, the remainder of the true cardinals and cardinal-like forms occur with plural lexical nouns and indicate Plural noun phrase. The exception is only which does not distinguish number. Like the

ordinals, the cardinal indicators tend to exclude a Neutral interpretation at the noun phrase level.
Table 4 summarizes these patterns. Since the plural meaning of these modifiers is redundant with the inflectional pattern on the lexical noun in the ordinary case, the main relevance of the ordinals and cardinals from the point of view of grammatical number is to distinguish the Singular noun phrases from Neutral ones. For irregular lexical noun forms, however, the marking of plural may not be redundant at the noun phrase level and then provides crucial information about grammatical number (for example, two deer ran by).
Other quantifier modifiers. The adjective much indicates quantity or amount but without actual reference to number in the sense of singularity or multiplicity. The form is also syntactically unusual in that, unlike other

Comparison of grammatical categories 31
quantitative modifiers, it virtually never co-occurs with the determiner the. Since much occurs with nonplural lexical noun forms yet does not have reference to singular meaning, it is often taken as a positive specification of Neutral noun phrase number. Another adjectival modifier little may also be mentioned here since it contrasts in use with much. When used to indicate quantity, little refers to size with some nouns (for example, the little box I bring) and amount with other nouns - where it can be regarded as being elliptical - (for example, the little [bit of] money learn). Correct interpretation depends on knowing certain aspects of the meaning value of the lexical noun head.
Marking noun phrase number by concord
Verbs
In addition to indications of number within the noun phrase itself or its equivalents, there are sometimes other positive indications of number at the larger clause level. Neutral and Singular noun phrases in English nominative case take special verbal concord (usually suffix -s) in the present indicative in contrast to Plural noun phrases. So a/some cake sits on the table contrasts with two cakes sit on the table. Absence of this special concord indicates that the noun phrase is Plural. But no such rules of agreement with verb phrases separate Singular from Neutral noun phrases - so the pattern of number marking in the present indicative verb matches exactly the patterning for the inflectional forms of the lexical nouns.
Pronouns
Number distinctions are also represented in the patterning of third person pronouns which are functionally equivalent to complete noun phrases. By looking at the cross-referencing relations with lexical noun phrases with known number (as well as by many other indications) it can be established that the third person pronouns theyIthem are Plural, he/him and she/her are Singular, and it can be either Singular or Neutral. Parallel patterns operate for cross-referencing with possessives: their, his, hers, its. In cases where these pronouns (excepting it) substitute for and/or cross-reference full noun phrases of uncertain number status, the pattern of agreement can signal the number of the corresponding noun phrase. Notice that number marking on the pronouns, like that on the

32 Grammatical categories and cognition
present indicative verb, generally follows the patterning for the inflection of lexical nouns (i.e., segments out Plural from everything else). But for nouns with masculine or feminine gender value, a true Singular is signaled.
Covert indications of grammatical number
Syntactic potential of lexical nouns
Any given lexical noun can be characterized as to the set of syntactic constructions that it is compatible with. Often there will be constructions into which a given lexeme will not fit. Such interaction effects were called reactances by Whorf and identifying such reactances is an important part of modern grammatical analysis. We can take the criterial frames so far described for number categories and ask whether various individual lexical nouns can fit into them. Plural is distinguished from both Singular and Neutral by inflectional -s and absence of special verbal concord when serving as the subject of a present indicative verb form. Singular is distinguished from Neutral by modifiers of various sorts, especially the application of the indefinite article a (~ an) in certain contexts. Neutral is thus the residual number category at the noun phrase level, but as a positive criterion we can look for simultaneous compatibility of 0 (phonological zero) indefinite article (or, alternatively, some [unstressed]) with nonplural lexical noun and nonplural present indicative verb.
Some nouns such as zinc only fit this Neutral frame: 0 zinc is hard. Such nouns are typically called "mass" nouns in grammatical descriptions of English. Some lexemes such as truck never fit this Neutral frame but do fit both Singular and Plural frames: a truck is coming I {some) trucks are coming. These are the nouns typically called "count" nouns in grammatical descriptions of English. Other nouns fit all three frames Singular, Plural and Neutral. The noun cake mentioned earlier is such a noun. Many nouns change their meaning considerably depending on the frame, a consideration taken up further below.
Some forms do not readilyfitinto these criterial patterns. For example, a form may meet one criterion of Plural but not another: the news is on shows plural suffix without plural concord, the cattle are coming shows plural concord without plural suffix. Disambiguating these cases requires examining the overall patterning and giving priority to some criteria over others. And general knowledge of the language may be essential here, for example, in recognizing the significance of the implicit alternation of cattle with cow and cows. Other nouns may appear to be plural but lack

any corresponding nonplural form: He gave me only the dregs shows what appears to be a plural form in dregs but there is no corresponding nonplural form *dreg.2 Some forms of this type will slowly undergo reanalysis to conform to the dominant pattern as in the creation of nonplural lexical noun scissor. (It also appears that the reverse process can occur as in, for example, the virtual disappearance of the nonplural form of galoshes in some dialects.)
If we add in these additional patterns of the grammar (for example, nonplural noun inflection with plural verb concord; cf. cattle earlier) we can define more distinctive frames and get more varieties of lexical nouns. So for example duck fits at least four frames: Singular a duck is flying overhead', Plural (some/three) ducks are swimming in the pond

34 Grammatical categories and cognition
(also ducks are good to eat); Neutral duck is fatty; "Aggregate" [?] duck are in season. Family also fits many frames: Singular a family is waiting; Plural two families are waiting (also families are important); Neutral family is important; "Collective" [?] (in some dialects) the family are agreed. Sorting out the semantic and pragmatic subtleties of some of these formal variations is a considerable task. Table 5 represents schematically some of the English lexical nouns mentioned above as well as some others with indications of how they distribute relative to the three formal attributes which have been emphasized here: inflection, modification, and concord.
Implicit (or deducible) number
In many syntactic constructions, some of the distinctions among kinds of grammatical number are formally neutralized. Nonetheless, number may be semantically implicated in these cases if we include as part of the meaning of each lexical noun the potential range of grammatical relations. For example, although there is no overt difference in number between the hammer is hard and the zinc is hard, the first sentence implicates Singular number and the second does not because of the selectional restrictions on the two nouns. Hammer can take the criterial Singular and Plural frames {a hammer is, two hammers are) and can never take the criterial Neutral pattern (*0 hammer is hard). Therefore, in a case like this where there is formal neutralization of the number distinction, that is, when Singular and Neutral cannot be distinguished by any overt mark, we can deduce nonetheless that the noun hammer must be singular because it can never take the overt, diagnostic Neutral pattern and hence that meaning. We may say that the noun phrase contains a covert indication of Singular by virtue of the broader distributional potential of the lexical noun. Zinc, by contrast, can take the overt Neutral pattern (0 zinc is hard) but can never take overt Singular or Plural patterns (*a zinc or *two zincs). So noun phrases containing zinc are always Neutral and the lexical noun itself may also be so construed. This sort of reasoning underlies the standard division of nouns in English into "count" and "mass" which essentially amounts to a description of the distributional pattern characteristic of each noun. It also underlies the reasoning which disambiguates number for constructions containing irregular lexical nouns.
The situation for nouns which fit all three criterial frames is obviously more complicated and in some cases we would want to say that a given noun has no fixed or preferred selectional pattern. For these nouns, when number is formally neutralized it is also semantically neutralized as

Comparison of grammatical categories 35
well. The number of these nouns must be specifically marked in the utterance if it is important. So, for example, the utterance the cake was hard in and of itself makes no commitment as to number, quantity, amount, multiplicity, etc., outside of a context such as prior speech or actual physical copresence where it might be deduced, because neither the covert limitations of the lexical noun cake nor the overt syntactic marking provides the information necessary to deduce number.
These rules of deducibility depend completely on there being a reliable difference in meaningful structural potential among the nouns of a language. If the structural difference had no semantic consequences there would be nothing to deduce. For example, if a hammer is hard and *0 hammer is hard were equally valid expressions for referring to the properties of a single hammer then there would be no basis for establishing a category of singular in the first place. If such a semantic difference is signaled and the noun routinely takes both forms, then there is no basis for deciding in the neutralized case. So if both of the expressions just cited were syntactically possible and semantically different (as is, in fact, the case with nouns such as cake) there would be no reliable way of differentiating on structural grounds which meaning must be present in the case of formal neutralization (i.e., in cases where the hammer is used). Finally, if all nouns had this same structural potential, and hence the same semantic ambiguity, then there would be nothing to add to the semantic specification of any given noun. Only when (1) a syntactic construction is meaningful, (2) its application is somewhat obligatory, and (3) there are restrictions on which nouns can enter that construction, can we then say that structural potential of this sort is a part of the meaning of noun phrases containing the noun. The most reliable difference is an absolutely obligatory syntactic distinction, although systematic statistical differences can sometimes serve.
Meaning: interaction of lexical content with grammatical number
Some lexical nouns when they take the plural inflection refer to a multiplicity of individuals or tokens of a given object. So three boys usually refers to three individual boys. Other nouns when they take the plural inflection imply a multiplicity of kinds or types of a given object. So three wines usually refers to three kinds of wine. From the point of view of number marking, the two situations are the same since in both cases multiplicity is being indicated. Whatever difference in meaning obtains for these two noun types must be a function of the meaning of the lexical noun itself. Similar arguments can be made for the application of marks for singular.

36 Grammatical categories and cognition
It has been common, as noted above, to regard nouns of the first type as "count" nouns. They are usually defined from a formal point of view as entering only Singular and Plural noun phrase construction types. In fact they can enter into Neutral noun phrase construction types precisely when the referent is being construed as a kind; this is usually made explicit: what kind of boy would do that?3 Nouns of the second type are regarded as "mass" nouns. They are usually defined from a formal point of view as entering only Neutral noun phrase construction types. But many such nouns can enter into Singular and Plural noun phrase construction types with a rather straightforward interpretation in terms of a singularity or multiplicity of kinds: we had a good wine last night, we had some good wines last night. To refer using these mass nouns with the sense of 'individuals' usually requires some overt signal that the referent is being construed as an individual: a bottle of wine.4
If a distinction is to be drawn between the referential potential of various nouns with respect to number, it should not be developed solely in terms of formal distributional categories where terms such as count and mass refer to nothing more than the compatibility of the noun with Singular/Plural or Neutral construction types. On the one hand, this approach produces a kind of tautology: nouns which can take a plural can take a plural and those which cannot, cannot. Such tautologies account for nothing. On the other hand, this approach ignores the large number of cases which violate the regularity and yet produce completely interpretable constructions. Rather, what is needed is a semi-independent description of the referential value of various types of lexical nouns which can be used to account for their meaningful interaction with number categories at the noun phrase level.
One clue to such an analysis in the present case lies in the meanings of the forms just cited. Whereas boys means multiplicity of individuals, wines means multiplicity of kinds. This suggests that one lexical noun type refers to individuals or units and the other to kinds or types. This is confirmed by the consequences of trying to reverse these emphases which produces the phrasal forms kind of boy and unit of wine. (It will be important in this regard to have some information about the operation of some of these phrasal forms in English; this is provided in the next section.) There seems to be some sort of inherent contrast among lexical noun types, then, as to whether they essentially refer to units or to kinds. (Alternative characterizations of this difference can be made in terms of an opposition in reference to forms or substances, to intrinsically bounded or unbounded entities, etc.) The important point is not to define this dimension of difference solely in terms of selectional restrictions with respect to grammatical number but in terms of inherent lexical content as manifest in a variety of ways. The nature of this particular

Comparison of grammatical categories 37
unit/kind opposition will not be explored further at this point but will be taken up later in the comparison with Yucatec.
Phrasal modifiers of quantity
A variety of phrasal constructions in English of the form "Noun Phrase 1 <?/Noun Phrase 2" can also be used to indicate quantity or amount (for example, a piece of meat). These forms provide a unit for those lexical nouns which essentially refer to kinds and indicate the specific nature of the unit for those lexical nouns which essentially refer to units. Understanding their operation will be important in the comparison with Yucatec. The relevant phrasal constructions can be grouped into partitives - including general partitives (for example, piece of cake), specific (or typical) partitives (for example, slice of cake), and measure partitives or measure phrases (for example, pound of cake) - and into quantitative estimators such as lots of as in lots of cake. Some of the so-called pre-determiners (for example, all [of]/both [of]/half [of] the cakes) also pattern like the quantitative estimators.5
For the partitives the lexical head of Noun Phrase 1 is usually the syntactic head of the larger phrasal construction and this fact is reflected in the patterning of grammatical number. Thus, in the clause two quarts of lemonade are already chilled, the adjective two, the plural suffix -s, and the verbal agreement are all center on quart and not lemonade, the head of Noun Phrase 2. Even though it might appear that the referent of Noun Phrase 2 in such constructions is the real focus of interest and that its lexical head {lemonade here, cake in the examples in the previous paragraph) should therefore be the head of the larger noun phrase, this is not the case for the partitives, nor is it the case in general in English for constructions of this type. Compare here two syntactic reductions which preserve this focus on Noun Phrase 1: two quarts are already chilled and some lemonade is already chilled', by contrast the following example shifts the focus: some lemonade is already chilled where the lexical noun lemonade is usually given contrastive stress.
In short, the partitive term (i.e., lexical head of Noun Phrase 1) functions syntactically as the head of the larger noun phrase even though it seems to be modifying Noun Phrase 2 by indicating its quantity. The syntactic focus, and ultimately the semantic focus, in these noun phrases is on the unit of grouping, containment, measurement, or segmentation and not on what the unit is a unit of. In line with this focus on units, Noun Phrase 1 tends to be Singular or Plural rather than Neutral.
Not all partitives can occur with all lexical nouns, and the pattern of selectional restrictions is quite complex. Nonetheless, relatively large

Letters heading columns indicate number for either Noun Phrase 1 or 2 as follows: S = Singular, N = Neutral, P = Plural. A plus (+) in a column indicates that the given number marking option is available for the particular type of partitive or estimator; a negative (-) indicates that the option is not available. Only general patterns are shown. aVerb agrees with Noun Phrase 1. 6Verb agrees with Noun Phrase 2.

groupings of nouns can be developed by working with the very general partitives. For example, if the lexical nouns compatible with the partitive phrasal (a) part of (a) are separated out, the nouns traditionally regarded as count nouns will be included. Finer groupings can be gotten with some of the more specific partitives. For example, (a) slice of (a) when applied

to concrete referents will sort out solids offirmshape (for example, a slice of baloney) from liquids (for example, *a slice of water). Such sortings may represent one way in which characterizations of inherent lexical content relevant to number patterning could be developed.
The quantitative estimators differ considerably from the partitives. Number agreement is with the lexical head of Noun Phrase 2:
lots of zinc ends up being wasted [zinc => nonplural verb] a lot of zinc ends up being wasted [zinc => nonplural verb] lots of pens end up in the trash can [pens=> plural verb] a lot of pens end up in the trash can [pens => plural verb].
In these cases Noun Phrase 2 has to be regarded as the head of the noun phrase in terms of its verbal concord. Further, this pattern can be used to infer the status of the lexical head of Noun Phrase 2 even when it is not formally expressed:
lots ends up being wasted [nonplural verb=>nonplural noun] a lot ends up being wasted [nonplural verb => nonplural noun] lots end up in the trash can [plural verb => plural noun] a lot end up in the trash can [plural verb =>plural noun].
This is deviant from the general pattern for partitives in English but does accord with the intuition that Noun Phrase 1 in some sense modifies Noun Phrase 2 (i.e., tells us "how much" of the referent of Noun Phrase 1 there is). These syntactic facts suggest that Noun Phrase 1 is acting here like a lexical modifier - a sort of frozen form equivalent to lexical modifiers such as many and much.
The number of Noun Phrase 2 is never Singular so that we can say that the estimators apply essentially to Plural or Neutral noun phrases. (In the examples just given, the implicit nonplural noun can actually be characterized more precisely as part of a Neutral noun phrase construction.) There is, however, some variability in their ability to take Plural or Neutral noun phrases and the pattern must be worked out for each individual estimator form. Some examples of these patterns and those of the relevant pre-determiner estimators are shown in table 6 along with the pattern for the partitives.
Summary
The basic English pattern overtly distinguishes Plural from both Singular and Neutral in the noun phrase. This is the pattern evidenced in lexical noun inflection and in concord with verbs, most pronouns, and demonstratives. For certain irregular nouns, the concord patterns may be the essential criteria for assigning number. At the level of the noun phrase,

40 Grammatical categories and cognition
Singular may be overtly signaled by the use of the indefinite article a (âan) and by the use of certain quantitative modifiers such as one, second, etc. Neutral noun phrases are either residually indicated by the use of certain determiner forms or by the absence of an article in indefinite noun phrases showing nonplural inflection and concord.
In many cases, especially for definite reference, overt number marking adequate to distinguish Singular from Neutral is not present. In such cases number can often be imputed on the basis of knowing the general distributional potential of the lexical noun head. Many traditional analyses use these distributional potentials to generate noun classes such as count and mass nouns. These analyses typically ignore a good part of the actual range of usage of the lexical forms and, from the point of view of giving an account of number marking, are fundamentally tautological. A more adequate approach would involve characterizing lexical noun types independently of grammatical number marking and then exploring the attested distributional potential in terms of an interaction of inherent lexical meaning and grammatical or structural meaning. A careful analysis of phrasal modifiers relevant to number and quantity might provide one source of classification of nouns into types. In the comparison with Yucatec developed below, certain others will be identified.
Description of Yucatec
Since most readers will have little familiarity with the Yucatec language, a brief sketch of some of the main typological characteristics of the language precedes the more detailed discussion of number marking.
Overview of Yucatec Maya
This sketch of Yucatec is intentionally brief and selective. The language is located socially and typologically. Emphasis is on the noun phrase since this may be useful in reading and (re)interpreting the main text or the materials in the appendices.
Geography and history
Modern Yucatec Maya is spoken throughout the northern Yucatan peninsula area in southeastern Mexico. Along with the related languages Lacandon (Chiapas, Mexico), Itza (Peten, Guatemala), and Mopan (southern Belize and Peten, Guatemala), it is part of the Peninsular

Maya subgroup (often termed Maya Proper or Yucatecan) within the Mayan family of languages (McQuown, 1956). There are some 350,000 speakers in all, but probably fewer than 50,000 monolinguals (Kaufman, 1974; Direction General, 1973). Modern Yucatec is little changed from Classical Yucatec Maya, the language of the post-Classic era in northern Yucatan at the time offirstSpanish contact (McQuown, 1967, p. 202; but cf. Bricker, 1979, pp. 113-15; 1981b). Many believe some variant of Yucatec was the language of the Classic period of Maya civilization and hence the basis of the written inscriptions of that era as well, but definitive evidence is still lacking; the principal alternative is the Cholan subgroup of Mayan languages (Kaufman, 1974; Morley, Brainerd, and Sharer, 1983, p. 504; cf. McQuown, 1967).

Phonology
Modern Yucatec has the consonantal phonemes shown in table 7 (Blair, 1965 [1964]; Straight, 1972). There arefivevowels that each occur in four phonemic length-tone combinations: short-neutral: i, e, a, o, u;

42 Grammatical categories and cognition
long-low: ii, ee, aa, 60, uu; long-high: li, ee, aa, 60, uu; and long-[high] broken (or glottalized): i'i, e'e, a'a, o'o, u'u (Blair, 1965 [1964]; Straight, 1972). Vowel alternation has both morphological and syntactic significance. Paralinguistic patterns affect the overt expression of vowels (McQuown, 1970). In rapid speech a considerable number of consonants and vowels may be omitted, but in relatively predictable ways.
Roots
Roots tend to be of monosyllabic Consonant-Vowel-Consonant form and there are estimated to be 2,000 such roots in the language (McClaran Stefflre, 1972, p. 262; McQuown, 1967, p. 208). Many, if not most, roots readily enter into both nominal or verbal constructions, that is, form nominal or verbal stems, with minimal derivational apparatus (McClaran Stefflre, 1972, p. 83), hence the categories of noun and verb appear to be modulus rather than selective (Whorf, 1956, pp. 93-99). These stems in turn anchor complex morphological affixing (predominantly postfixing) and infixing (especially in verbal constructions) to form lexical nouns and lexical verbs. These "lexical" items are equivalent in many cases to full phrases and, especially in the case of verbs, to complete clauses or sentences.
Noun phrases
Case
Noun phrases as such do not have overt morphological marks for the primary syntactic case relations of intransitive subject and transitive agent and patient;6 lexical meaning, word order, and cross-referencing verb- or preposition-bound pronominal markers carry this information. A generic preposition tV~t- serves to express locative, directional, and other relationships: tV meesa 'to/at the table'. If an additional noun is related to the predicate, it is preceded by this generic preposition thereby overtly marking the additional case relation. Possession is marked by a pronominal prefix on the possessed noun cross-referencing to the possessor which follows immediately (if it is expressed): "u-kiby Juan 'hiscandle John [i.e., John's candle]'. Many specialized locative expressions combine this pattern of possession with the generic preposition; the first noun indicates relative placement and the second indicates with respect to what object: t-u-(el nah 'to-its-side house [i.e., to the side of the house]'.

Comparison of grammatical categories 43
Number and gender
Noun phrases are not obligatorily marked for number and gender and are apparently neutral on these dimensions. However, some lexical nouns, primarily animates, are often marked optionally for number (Singular or Plural) and gender (Masculine or Feminine). Neither of these requires agreement with other material within the noun phrase. Most often, number is marked by pronouns forming part of the verb complex; agreement is not obligatory.
Modification
Demonstratives frame or bracket the noun phrase with a prefix/postfix combination: for example, le- ... -o' 'that' frames mdak 'man' to yield le-mdak-o" 'that man'. Enumeration with Yucatec numerals requires the insertion of a numeral classifier between numeral and lexical noun (if there is one) which provides information about the unit being counted: kd'a-tuul mdak 'two-animate man [i.e., two men]'. The noun need not be pluralized and usually is not. Enumeration with Spanish numerals does not require a classifier. Constructions with a Yucatec numeral and classifier serve a variety of syntactic functions that in other languages might be handled by articles or gender marking. Thus, the unstressed numeral 'one' along with the appropriate classifier can be used to indicate indefinite reference: 'un-tuul mdak 'one-animate man [i.e., a man]'. In general, adjective modifiers precede the lexical noun and derivational affixes (which often have adjectival value) follow the stem. Relative clauses follow the modified lexical noun.
Verb phrases
A copula or equational verbal relation is not expressed morphologically (i.e., it is a phonological zero). Other verb forms fall into three classes depending on the suffixation necessary to form a transitive from a verb stem; further subclasses can be defined by other inflectional patterning (Blair, 1965 [1964]). There is as yet no adequate analysis of the full semantic implications of these classes and subclasses although some preliminary work has been done (McClaran Stefflre, 1972; Owen, 1969 [1968]). Perfective (or completive), imperfective (or incompletive) and optative (or subjunctive) aspects are marked in the verb complex. Perfective is not further differentiated by other essentially aspectual distinctions; imperfective and optative are differentiated into a variety of

different forms referring to temporal contour distinctions (Blair, 1965 [1964]; Bricker, 1981a). Many of these forms involve some tense-like meanings, but in general tense is subordinate to aspect in terms of formal elaboration and semantic significance.
Pronouns and case marking
Two bound pronoun sets (shown in table 8) occur within both minimal and verbal constructions. There is a prefixing set, traditionally called the A series, which marks agent with transitive verbs and possession with nouns, and a postfixing set, traditionally called the B series, which marks patient with transitive verbs and forms equational constructions with nouns. For intransitive verbs, subject pronouns vary as a function of aspect: perfective and optative intransitives take the B series (i.e., case-marking in these aspectual paradigms, taken alone, looks ergativeabsolutive), and the imperfective group of intransitives take the A series (i.e., case-marking in the imperfective paradigm, taken alone, looks nominative-accusative). Reflexives are indicated by a special form that follows the predicate and inflects with the A set.
The A and B sets overlap in the plural where the postfixing B series plural forms are used with the prefixing (A series) nonplural forms to produce A series plural verb complexes. In most parts of Yucatan, the first person plural form of the A series (marked 1st plural2 in table 8) is irregular from a formal point of view. In the village, a regular form (marked 1st plurali in table 8) is also used. (Speakers of other Yucatec

Comparison of grammatical categories 45
dialects apparently do not use this form.) These two plurals are not in any readily definable paradigmatic alternation.
Word order and syntax
Basic word order has been regarded as VOS or SVO depending on the criteria used. (See the discussions of these alternative basic word orders in Durbin and Ojeda, 1978, and in Bricker, 1979.) All six basic word orders are acceptable each with specific pragmatic and semantic effects. As yet, higher level syntactic structures (i.e., above the level of morphotactics) have been little studied in Yucatec.
Discourse structures
Discourse structures in the sense of general devices for linking clause and sentence level structures to one another to form a coherent utterance in Yucatec have as yet received little research attention. Larger discourse patterns defining genres of speech have also received little attention. Preliminary work has been conducted on some of the more readily definable forms of speech, for example, poetic structuring of prayers, letters, stories (historical and fictional), and short proverbs and riddles (Bricker, 1974; Burns, 1983; Hanks, 1986; Lucy, 1992). Nearly everything still remains to be done with respect to characterizing the general structure of everyday speech patterns.
Uses of language
The Maya use language primarily for social communication. Speech varies markedly as to topic and manner depending on the participants in the interchange. Four global spheres can be defined by reference to the typical addressees or audience: private speech to near kin, public speech to fellow villagers, diplomatic speech to outside officials (for example, of government or church), and ritual speech to deities. In moving along the gradient from private to ritual speech, the content of speech becomes less important and the form relatively more important. Each of these is cross cut in significant ways in terms of the sex, age, social status, and social role of speaker and addressee. The net result is a complicated cultural system, but one which is essentially socially anchored.
There is no general pattern of sustained use or specialized involvement with language by lone individuals, for example in meditation, philosophi-

46 Grammatical categories and cognition
zing, entertainment, problem solving, etc. Even ritual specialists tend to conform to this pattern, although Bible reading has become a solitary religious activity for one or two men in the village. There are no elaborate debates about the true meanings of words or about the relation of words to reality. The occasional conversations as to the correct way a speech or ceremony should be given stress the traditional form rather than the referential content of what is said. What individual psychological uses may be made of language categories remain tacit and undeveloped. Reading, writing, and education in general are recognized as valuable accomplishments but they are closely tied to Spanish and have little to do with Yucatec.
Overt indications of grammatical number
To the extent possible, Yucatec will be described in terms of the same formal framework as the English discussion so as to highlight the similarities and differences. Whenever possible, illustrations from English are provided which suggest the meaning value of the Yucatec forms.
Marking noun phrase number by inflection
Yucatec lexical nouns can be marked for plural by suffixing ~6'ob' to the lexical noun head, so peek' 'dog,' plus -o'ob' '[plural marker]' yields peek'-o'ob' 'dogs'. This suffix is identical to the one suffixed to verbs to indicate the presence of third person plural complement. The suffix is usually used to indicate explicitly that the noun phrase refers to a multiplicity of referents; sometimes it apparently suggests that all of a given group of referents are being referred to.
The suffix is optional oxfacultative in that it need not be used for correct reference when a multiplicity of referents does in fact exist, but it can be used to clarify or emphasize such multiplicity. For example, ydan peek' teyeloy 'there-is-dog over-there' is ambiguous syntactically as to whether it refers to a multiplicity of referents or not. Specifically, it can refer to more than one dog: 'there are dogs over there'. This is quite similar to the ambiguity of some definite noun phrases in English: in the sentence I saw the deer this morning it is not clear on morphosyntactic grounds (either overt or covert) whether the person saw one deer or many deer or whether the intent is to contrast having seen deer with having seen some other kind of animal. In the absence of the plural suffix, then, Yucatec noun phrase heads have truly neutral form with respect to number. The

Comparison of grammatical categories 47
term neutral makes clear the semantically indeterminant status of the uninflected form: the lexical nouns themselves can be used just as well with a multiplicity of referents as with one referent. The lexical head cannot be called nonplural (as in English) since it is not in obligatory alternation with an available plural form. And the facultative nature of the plural is consistent with this neutral status of the lexical noun. (Notice that this use of the term "neutral" is slightly different from, although consistent with, that developed in the discussion of English. In English, Neutral was applied to a noun phrase not formally marked Plural or Singular and where number could not be deduced on lexical [selectional] grounds. The form of the lexical noun itself in such a Neutral construction was nonplural. Here we are saying the lexical noun itself is neutral.) The application of the -o'ob' suffix is also syntactically optional in that it is not required even when there are other indications of a multiplicity of referents in the noun phrase or associated verb phrase. So one can speak of $'ee$'ekpeek' 'few dog' without any need to attach the plural suffix to peek' 'dog'.
One complication in the interpretation of Yucatec noun phrases arises from the pattern for indicating possession. In general, under traditional interpretations, possession is indicated by attaching an A series pronoun. For the third person possessive, the forms are neutral 'u- 'its [~his, hers7]/their' and plural 'u-... -o'ob' 'their'. For example, 'u-peek' 'his/their dog' and 'u-peek'-6'ob' 'their dog'. Of course, this last form is further ambiguous since it could also represent the neutral form of the possessive ('w- 'his/their') attached to the plural noun {peek'-o'ob' 'dogs') to yield 'his/their dogs'. The difficulty lies in the fact that the -o'ob' could arise from two different sources: plural noun inflection or plural possessor. In fact, some analysts have argued that the same form can even cover both senses, one of the two instantiations being deleted in the noun phrase, and so 'their dogs' is also a viable interpretation. Hence the form 'u-peek'-o'ob' is usually interpreted as triply ambiguous. The fact which is overlooked in these analyses is that the form 'u-peek' (i.e., neutral possessive with neutral noun) can also take each of these three meanings (i.e., 'his dogs,' 'their dog,' 'their dogs') as well as the additional meaning 'his dog'. The semantic ambiguity is present in the noun phrase quite independently of any plural marks because of the neutrality of Yucatec nouns and third person pronouns with respect to number; no arguments in terms of referential value will help in assigning a status to -o'ob' in such cases. All we know for sure is that something is definitely plural in (or about) the noun phrase. However, in terms of simple frequency, -o'ob' in such constructions usually emphasizes the multiplicity of the head noun rather than the possessor. When the nature of the possession is inherently unique, however, plurality of the possessor seems to be the appro-

48 Grammatical categories and cognition
priate interpretation. For example, in the expression 'u-ndah-il-6'ob' 'their houses/homes' each individual can be understood to have only one house - as suggested by the -il '[inherency]' suffix on the root - and so the primary multiplicity must be of possessors although this guarantees a multiplicity of houses as well.
There are few unusual cases in the formation of Yucatec plurals. The only significant irregularity involves the suffix -al which applies to a few forms in the language. So for example pal 'child' can become pal-al 'children'. The form may be a collective (similar to family in English): 'children of one person'. Note for example the latter can itself take -6'ob\ hence pal-al-6'ob' 'children [for example, the children in the village]'. Another striking though perfectly predictable pattern arises with Spanish loan words. In some cases the plural inflectional form of the Spanish lexical noun has been taken into Yucatec as a neutral form which can then be pluralized in the usual fashion: Spanish vaquero-s 'cowboy' plus Yucatec -o'ob' '[plural]' yields Yucatec vaquero-s-6'ob' 'cowboys [i.e., a group of young men who assist a bullfighter]'. As Spanish becomes better known, the original value of vaqueros as plural reasserts itself for some speakers - at least in formal settings. However, for words with more phonological alteration from the original Spanish, this does not happen: Spanish vacas 'cows' becomes Yucatec wdakas 'cow, bull' which is always pluralized waakas-6'ob' 'cows, bulls'.
Marking of noun phrase number by modification
The principal modifiers relevant to indicating number are the quantitative adjectives. Neither descriptive adjectives nor most determiners routinely indicate grammatical number, although interactions with specific lexical content can occasionally produce such effects. The only determiner forms which signal grammatical number are the forms used to establish indefinite reference. But these forms are actually unstressed quantitative adjectives containing the numeral prefix 'one'. For this reason, these "indefinite articles" will be treated here with the quantifier adjectives.
Quantitative modifiers involving numerals
Singularity or multiplicity of referents can be signaled in Yucatec as in English by a modifier containing a numeral. Noun phrases of this type obligatorily involve a special type of morpheme known as a numeral classifier which is bound to the numeral. Understanding the structure and

functioning of these classifiers is crucial to understanding number marking in Yucatec.
Explanation of the term "numeral classifier." A large number of languages in Asia and the New World exhibit a syntactic pattern known as numeral classification. When counting or enumerating in these languages, an extra morpheme must also be used in addition to those expressing the number and the referent. This additional morpheme expresses or makes explicit further information about the nature of the referent. For example, whereas in English one can say two turkeys (i.e., number4-plural lexical noun), in Yucatec Maya one must say kd'atuul yuulum (i.e., number + extra morpheme + neutral lexical noun). Usually a language which makes use of such a construction contains a number of these morphemes. Because each of the nouns in a language

50 Grammatical categories and cognition
tends to co-occur primarily with one such morpheme, the nouns are effectively grouped into classes - hence, the traditional label numeral classifiers.

Commonly used classifiers in Yucatec. It is difficult to state exactly how many classifiers there are in Yucatec since the system is partially productive, that is, new forms can be created if necessary. Also, there appear to be differences in both regional and individual usage. If we restrict ourselves to commonly used items, Classical Yucatec had well over 200 and Modern Yucatec has somewhat fewer than 100 (cf. Miram, 1983). For present purposes it will suffice to indicate the principal types of numeral classifiers used with lexical nouns and some examples of frequently used items of each type. These are given in table 9.8

Syntax of noun phrases containing numerals. Numeral classifier morphemes can form part of a full noun phrase or, along with the accompanying numeral, stand for such a noun phrase. The order of the morphemes is as follows: Numeral (or equivalent) + Classifier + Lexical Noun (or equivalent).

The preposed numerals. Four Yucatec numerals are still in common use, each with a number of phonologically conditioned variants:

'un- (~ 'um- ~ hunâ hum-) 'one',

kd'a- (~kd'-~kd'ab'-)

'two',

'60s- (~yoos-)

'three', and

kan- (~ kam-)

'four'.

Any of these four numerals may occur with each classifier with the exception of a few forms (examples are listed as irregularities in table 9) which are restricted to 'un- and its variants, hday- 'how many' can also occur in place of a numeral:

hday-tuul mdak 'how many men [in a question]'.

Numerals require the presence of a classifier with two exceptions. First, numerals may be prefixed to verbal stems as adverbials to indicate multiple iterations of the predicate:

ydan a-kd'a-b'in 'you must go a second time [i.e., again]'.

Second, they may appear with a set of related suffixes -eh, -he-ak, and, perhaps, also -ak, which are used for counts of days:

kd'ab'-eh y6os-eh kd'a-fi-ak (<kdfa(bf)-he-ak) 'oos-fi-ak- (<'6os-he-ak)

'two days from today' 'three days from today' 'two days ago' 'three days ago'.

Comparison of grammatical categories 51

It is possible to give all these forms an adverbial interpretation and generalize that numerals in conjunction with nouns (or their equivalents) always take classifiers.
Numerals may be reduplicated to indicate special senses:

hu-hum-p'iit-il kd'a-kd'a-tuul-il kd'a-kd'a-teh

'little-by-little', 'two-by-two', '(until) later'.

Spanish numerals may also be used with classifiers. They are usually used to indicate counts larger than four and they take a slightly different syntactic construction:

diez yu-tuul-ul mdak 'ten men',

diez 'u-tuul-ul

'ten [men]'.

The syntactic significance and interpretation of these mixed constructions is quite complicated and will not be taken up here.

The postposed lexical noun (or equivalent).9 Most classifiers can be followed by a lexical noun. Usually, these are common nouns, but proper nouns also occur:

'oos-tuul mdak 'oos-p'eeh Juan

'three men', 'three Johns'.

Inversely, every lexical noun in Yucatec can follow some such classifier. In fact Blair (1965 [1964], p. 46) uses this as one of his criteria for identifying nouns in Yucatec. So the ability to take a numeral modifier with a classifier does not in and of itself separate out subsets of nouns in Yucatec. (Note: peeh is an alternate form of the classifier//^/.)
The lexical noun may be replaced by a pronominal form (in particular a suffix from the B series) producing an equational sentence:

'6os~tuul-6'on 'the three of us/we are three'.

First and second persons pronominal suffixes tend to occur only in the plural and mostly with -tuul, but there are exceptions. Third person forms also tend to occur mostly with -tuul but can be used more widely. All these pronoun forms presuppose the nominalization of the Numeral + Classifier combination and then use it as a base to form an equational sentence. Further, since in many cases the third person neutral pronoun form can emerge as a phonological zero, -0, classifiers with no following nominal material can often be interpreted as taking this pronoun form. This is, for example, the underlying structure in cases in which the classifier is followed by a clause:

'6os-p'eel-0 'u-b'in 'three [more] to go'.

52 Grammatical categories and cognition

Use of classifiers as ordinal indicators. Numeral classifier constructions can be augmented by the use of an "inherency" marker -il (often realized as -ih) to derive ordinal indicators:

{le-) yd'as um-p'eel-ih [le-) '6os-p'eel-ih (Mi-) kd'a-p'eel-ih

'the first [one]', 'the third [one]', 'both'.

Use of classifiers to establish reference. Numeral classifier constructions, as has already been mentioned, frequently serve to establish initial reference in cases where an indefinite article would be used in English. The most frequently used forms in this context are the three most general classifiers in conjunction with the numeral prefix signaling 'one':

'un-tuul mdak 'um~p'eeh ndah 'um-p'iit ha'

'a man', 'a house', 'a little bit of water'.

Modification of the lexical noun by the numeral 'one' in conjunction with the classifier is the basic way of indicating Singular in Yucatec. But, since all nouns require a classifier construction, the Singular frame does not in itself distinguish out any subgroups of nouns. However, the various lexical nouns can be sorted into categories on the basis of their semantic compatibility with specific classifiers.
The Numeral + Classifier construction can also be used alone without a following noun phrase as a deictic or anaphoric form much like English one:
(lit ten 'um-pfeeh 'give me one'.

Thus the close connection in English between indefinite article a, numeral one, and anaphoric one is also found in Yucatec, but with the important difference that the classifier morpheme is obligatorily involved in all such constructions. Therefore, in the process of introducing a referent or signaling Singular, considerable additional semantic information will be signaled. It is as if Yucatec has a large array of indefinite articles, numerals, and pro-forms each with a somewhat different meaning.

Quantitative modifiers without numerals
There are several important quantitative modifiers in Yucatec which do not involve numerals. Of these, only t'eet'ek 'few' seems to imply as part of its lexical meaning that the noun phrase has Plural meaning. Three others imply as part of their lexical meaning that the noun phrase has Singular meaning: 'u-ldak 'another [emphasizing otherness]', fu-heh

Comparison of grammatical categories 53
'another [emphasizing sameness]', and mdakal mdak 'which'. The four remaining forms hold no reliable implications for grammatical number even though they indicate quantity: lah 'all', t-u-ldak-al 'all, every one', yd'ab' 'many, much', and mis 'no, not'. For the purposes of comparison, table 10 shows the Yucatec forms used to convey the English senses discussed in the previous section.

Marking noun phrase number by concord

Pronominals bound to the verb

Number is optionally marked on the verb complex by cross-referencing bound pronominal affixes. For example, the third person intransitive forms (A series) are as follows:

'U-VERB
'u-vERB-6'ob'

'it/he/she/they VERB [i.e., neutral form]', 'they VERB'.

Notice that the agreement in these cases is asymmetric in an important respect: plural pronoun implies that the cross-referenced noun phrase is Plural whether or not it is inflected for plural; however neutral pronoun does not imply anything specific about number in the crossreferenced noun phrase. In fact, a neutral pronoun form can crossreference a noun phrase explicitly marked by inflection for Plural. Nonetheless, to repeat, in those cases where the verb complex contains a plural pronoun, it indicates that the cross-referenced noun phrase can be construed as Plural. For transitive and other verbs with multiple noun phrase complements, there can be semantic ambiguity about which cross-referencing noun phrase the plural mark applies to: t-u-bis-ah-6'ob' can mean 'he took them', 'they took it', or 'they took them'.

Pronominals not bound to the verb
The pattern for free pronouns is the same. So both peek' 'dog [neutral]' and peek'-o'ob' 'dogs [plural]' can be cross-referenced by free pronoun forms letV 'it/he/she/them [neutral]' or by leti'-o'ob' 'they [plural]'; but leti'-o'ob' directly implies that the overtly neutral peek' is part of a noun phrase Plural whereas letV implies nothing about noun phrase number.
A similar asymmetrical agreement pattern applies for several other bound pronominal forms:

Covert indications of grammatical number
Given the pattern of facultative number marking in Yucatec, lexical nouns cannot be categorized on the basis of taking obligatory marking. Yucatec lexical nouns can only be separated into groups on the basis of frequency of plural inflection or concord, that is, nouns which frequently take suffix -&oby either as a direct inflection or as part of the crossreferencing bound pronoun on the verb. There is an overwhelming tendency in everyday speech to limit plural inflection and concord to animate entities or to objects in one-to-one relation to an animate possessor (for example, heads, houses, etc.).
Lexical nouns can be distinguished by their compatibility with various quantitative modifiers - including the numeral classifiers. However, membership in such a semantic class does not reliably correspond with any pattern of obligatory number marking and therefore cannot serve as a diagnostic for syntactic potential with respect to number. Nonetheless, as will become clear below, such modifier classes can be revealing from a comparative point of view.
Given the facultative nature of plural marking in Yucatec it is impossible to develop the argument that some set of lexical nouns has distinctive inherent lexical content such as "countability" which would allow us to assign grammatical number in ambiguous cases on the basis of overall configurational pattern. Notice that two of the criteria for deducibility mentioned in the discussion of English have been met: there is a meaningful category (signaling multiplicity) with a regular pattern of distribution (tending to apply to animates). But the distinction is not obligatory. Therefore, there can be no criterial frameworks (distinctive reactances) which reliably distinguish among lexical nouns which must have a specific grammatical number. In general, then, grammatical number is not syntactically deducible in Yucatec by reference to underlying lexical content.

Summary
The basic Yucatec pattern is to disregard number, and most lexical noun phrases are Neutral in number. Plural may be distinguished facultatively

56 Grammatical categories and cognition
(for example, for emphasis) either by lexical noun inflection or by concord with cross-referencing pronouns in the verb complex. Singular and Plural may also be signaled facultatively by a variety of specific quantitative modifiers. (None of these modifier forms either with or without numerals require any other formal plural or singular marks in the noun phrase or the clause.) In the absence of any pattern of obligatory number marking these facultative signals can not be used to ground or provide any reliable information concerning inherent lexical number. Number distinctions as such simply do not have the general significance within Yucatec grammar that they do in English, and grammatical number is expressed very indifferently in comparison with English.
Comparison of Yucatec and English
Both English and Yucatec represent number in the noun phrase and do so in somewhat similar ways: they both mark Plural by inflection and concord, they both mark Singular by adjectival modification (determiners and/or quantitative adjectives), and they both provide a variety of specialized modifiers to indicate other number distinctions. However, the overt expression of Plural is more important in English, where it is obligatory for a large range of noun phrases, than it is in Yucatec, where it is optional for a relatively small range of noun phrases. And the structure of quantitative modification involved in the overt expression of Singular differs considerably - most notably the obligatory use of numeral classifiers for all numeral modification in Yucatec. This section characterizes these two differences more precisely and places them within a broader comparative framework.
Contrast in plural marking (inflection and concord)10
The pluralization patterns of the two languages differ in several ways. The goal of this section is to characterize these differences more precisely and in a form which will be suitable for generating hypotheses about cognitive consequences. The analysis will proceed from a general, interpretive characterization to a more specific, formal characterization. Then some indications will be given as to how the analysis can be extended to additional languages and patterns of pluralization. For the purposes of this section, no distinction will be made between Plural marking by inflection and Plural marking by concord.

Comparison of grammatical categories 57
Clarifying the contrast between English and Yucatec
English obligatorily marks Plural for a wide range of lexical noun phrases whereas Yucatec optionally marks Plural for a relatively small range of lexical noun phrases. Thus there are two dimensions of difference: scope of application and obligatoriness of application. At the outset I will conflate these two dimensions by speaking of typical patterns of pluralization. By focusing on typical patterns of pluralization we incorporate both semantic requirements and pragmatic regularities into a unified formulation. Alternatively, one could represent only obligatory pluralization (in which case one focuses on semantic requirements and the differences between the languages become larger) or one could represent only the existence of the option of pluralization (in which case one focuses on pragmatic possibilities and the differences between languages become smaller). Later, when we examine other languages where information about pluralization may be incomplete or when we try to account for underlying semantic structure, it will be fruitful to attend to patterns of obligatory marking.
The distributional pattern
The differences in typical patterns of pluralization in English and Yucatec can be characterized more precisely in terms of groups of lexical noun phrases. A sample of more or less equivalent minimal lexical noun phrases with concrete reference can be selected from each of the two languages so as to include some noun phrases which both languages typically pluralize (Group 1), some noun phrases which neither language typically pluralizes (Group 3), and some noun phrases for which the two languages differ in their typical pattern (Group 2). These three noun phrase groups have been defined, then, purely on formal, distributional grounds. These distributional facts can then be represented as shown in table II.11
Providing a notional characterization
Since the three noun phrase groups in table 11 are defined purely distributionally, that is, they are defined solely in terms of whether or not they take plural marking in the two languages, they cannot be used to characterize or account for those distributional patterns. However, each of these groupings of lexical noun phrases corresponds to a grouping of

referents. These groups of referents, it turns out, are not mere aggregations, but can each be characterized in terms of certain typical attributes. Group 1 noun phrases tend to refer to animate beings and similar self-segmenting12 entities (for example, dogs, automobiles), Group 2 noun phrases tend to refer to discrete objects and similar stably segmented entities (for example, shovels), and Group 3 noun phrases tend to refer to tangible materials (or substances) with malleable form and similar segmentable entities (for example, mud). These regularities raise the possibility that the noun phrase groups and their referential meaning values can be established on independent grounds and then used to characterize the scope of plural marking in the two languages.
The groupings involved here do not directly correspond to, and are not reducible to, those that might be made on nonlinguistic grounds. For example, from a strictly biological vantage the group of typically pluralized referents singled out by Group 1 (i.e., the lexical nouns typically pluralized in both languages) does not include all biologically animate beings (for example, insects) and does include some entities that are not biologically animate (for example, trucks). Thus, the grouping reflects something about the organization of experience for the purposes of speech rather than solely some independent regularity in the world. This can be stated more generally: languages (both individually and collectively) construe entities from the point of view of language as a referential and predicational device and not solely or consistently in terms of extra-linguistic (or natural) characterizations.13 Thus, to continue the example, when Group 1 is described as typically referring to animates, it indicates that most noun phrases in that group refer to biologically animate referents but that some also refer to referents which share the typical volitional, agentive, or motive properties of such animates as these are relevant to predication.
The development of noun phrase groups, then, cannot proceed either by simply characterizing the formal distributional regularities of a given language (language as pure form) or by simply characterizing the objects

Comparison of grammatical categories 59
of reference (the world) in nonlinguistic terms and treating language categories as a reflex of them (language as transparent content). Rather, we want to characterize distributional regularities insofar as they represent or refer to the world in a characteristically linguistic fashion, that is, in terms of characteristic language-world (form-content) relationships.14 Specifically, we want to characterize noun phrase types in terms of cross-linguistically grounded (proto) typical features of referential meaning. In essence, we need a metalanguage for the description of noun phrase types (typical linguistic meanings) that will be independent of the formal categories of any particular language yet dependent for its terms on the way languages in general construe reality.15
Such a feature-based description of the noun phrase types relevant to any given grammatical category can be developed by cross-linguistic comparison of an array of morphosyntactic structures within the framework of markedness theory (Silverstein, 1976,1981,1986,1987). Development and justification of such a referential feature description for noun phrase types specifically relevant to pluralization is a complicated task beyond the scope of the present work. Nonetheless, a beginning can be made by employing referential features already identified by others to characterize the particular noun phrase types in question. Then some indications will be given as to how the approach can be extended to new languages and further referential features. Finally, the general procedure for developing a feature-based characterization of noun phrase types will be discussed.
Comparison in terms of referential features
Two referential features are sufficient to generate the three noun phrase types suitable for the comparison of Yucatec and English plural marking.16 The first feature is [Â±animate]. Noun phrases marked [+animate] specifically signal reference to an animate entity in the special sense clarified above.17 By contrast, those marked [âanimate] are not specified one way or the other as to animacy from a linguistic point of view - they may, in fact, refer to both animate or inanimate entities. However, under appropriate conditions, by residual interpretation, noun phrases marked [-animate] can be considered to have a negative value, that is, to refer to "inanimates."
The second feature is [Â± discrete].18 This feature stands in a regular markedness relationship with the first, that is, the two features do not freely cross-cut each other and [Â± discrete] is only specified if the noun phrase is [âanimate]. In other words, in the context of a noun phrase marked [+ animate], the distinction [Â± discrete] is generally not oper-

60 Grammatical categories and cognition
ative, that is, the applicability of the broader, less specific feature [Â± discrete] is contingent on the narrower, more specific feature not being specified (i.e., having negative value [âanimate]):
[+ animate] [- animate]
[+ discrete] [- discrete]
Thus, noun phrases overtly specified [+ animate, 4- discrete] should not ordinarily occur. To avoid possible confusion on this score, the values of a more general feature such as [Â± discrete] will be indicated (written out) only when the more specific feature actually has negative (neutral) specification such as [-animate]. This should not obscure the fact that the positive value of the general feature will usually be guaranteed when the more specific feature is positive (for example, any animate is perforce discrete, etc.).19
Noun phrases marked [+ discrete] specifically signal reference to distinct, stably bounded objects.20 By contrast, those marked [- discrete] are not specified one way or the other as to distinctness from a linguistic point of view though they may refer to a perceptually distinct entity. Again, under appropriate conditions by residual interpretation, noun phrases marked [- discrete] can be considered to have a negative value, that is, to refer to "materials" or "substances."
Using these two features we can characterize three types of lexical noun phrases: Type A21 is specified [+ animate], Type B is specified [animate, + discrete], and Type C is specified [- animate, - discrete]. We can now express the scope of pluralization in the two languages in terms of these three noun phrase types as shown in table 12. Unlike table 11 which made no reference to the meaning value of the noun phrase groups shown, table 12 indicates clearly that the application of plural marking is contingent on (a function of) the meaning value of noun phrases as these are embodied in referential features.
Secondary advantages of a feature representation
In addition to incorporating referential meaning into the representation of the contrast of scope of plural marking, the characterization of such differences in terms of referential features presents several secondary advantages. First, it allows regularities in the application of grammatical

number to be related to other grammatical categories within the language that are contingent on the same or related referential features. This provides the foundation for an analysis of a larger "fashion of speaking" involving multiple, cross-cutting categories. Second, it allows the expression of the cross-linguistic comparison in terms of general types of noun phrases. This allows the comparison to accommodate and utilize a larger array of lexical items since cross-language comparison does not depend on comparing a specific fixed set of equivalent lexical items across languages. Third, to the extent the features are ordered with respect to one another by marking relationships, they can provide a common framework for ordering or relating the various patterns of pluralization among languages. Such a framework will be discussed in the next section.

Generalizing the analysis for further comparisons
A central goal of the present work is to indicate how this analysis could be extended to encompass other languages and other grammatical categories. This section indicates the procedure for extending the analysis begun in the previous section to additional languages and features by providing some further examples.

Generalizing to additional languages
We can take the comparison just developed and apply it to additional languages. For each language, lexical noun phrases with various feature

The English and Yucatec data have been given earlier in this chapter. The Hopi pattern is reported in Whorf (1946; 1956, pp. 139-42); further details appear in Voegelin and Voegelin (1957) and Kalectaca (1978). The Chinese (Mandarin) pattern is reported in Chao (1968, ch. 7, section 2) and Li and Thompson (1981, pp. 11-12, 40-41); see also Smith-Stark (1974, p. 663). The Tarascan pattern is reported in Friedrich (1970); see also Smith-Stark (1974, p. 663). a Facultative marking of plural is common with Type A noun phrases.

specifications can be identified and evaluated as to whether they typically take plural marking. In many cases, such comparisons will have to operate with incomplete information. For example, many grammatical descriptions do not report on the scope of plural marking or, if they do, they tend to report on the scope of obligatory marking and provide little or no information on optional or facultative marking. Therefore, comparisons made on the basis of existing descriptive materials will generally have to be done in terms of obligatory or highly regular patterns. Further, although comparison would best be done at the level of the whole noun phrase in relation to the verb phrase so that the multiple formal means of marking (for example, inflection, modification, concord, etc.) employed by different languages could be represented, adequate information may not be available on all the relevant means of marking. As a rule, morphological patterns such as inflectional marks for plural are most adequately described in grammars.
Despite these difficulties, however, useful comparisons can still be

made. In table 13 a few additional languages are added to English and Yucatec to show how these two stand in relation to some other patterns of plural marking. Table 13 shows the presence or absence of obligatory morphological marking of plural on lexical noun phrases of the three types defined earlier. (Notice, now, that because we are dealing with obligatory patterns, the coding of Yucatec for Type A noun phrases shifts to "no.") It should be clear that both languages fit easily into an orderly array of language types.
Generalizing to additional features
The format of table 13 clearly represents the differences among languages at issue in the present discussion. However, other referential features than the two discussed so far govern the scope application of plural marking in many languages. Smith-Stark (1974) has proposed a preliminary list of such features developed by examining published grammars of a sample of 25 languages.22 To the extent relevant data were available, he divided the nouns (including pronominals) of each language into groups on the basis of whether or not they took certain forms of plural marking including verb-argument concord, noun-modifier concord, and direct morphological marking on the noun and whether or not these patterns were optional or obligatory. In most cases, each number marking pattern split at a certain point, that is, with respect to a certain referential feature, such that each mode of pluralization applied to some noun types and not to others. The features identified by Smith-Stark were as follows: [Â± speaker], [Â± speech event participant],23 [Â± kin], [Â± rational], [Â± human living], [Â± human], [Â± animate], [Â± neuter]. The ordering of the features is significant: Smith-Stark pointed out that these features are ordered such that if plural marking of a given type applies to nouns characterized by one feature, then it will apply to nouns characterizable by the higher, more specific features. Where there are multiple modes of marking the plural, multiple number marking patterns sometimes emerge each with its own characteristic division or split of the nouns of the language. Still further subdivisions of pattern are possible if one sorts on the basis of the specific morphological forms actually used for marking.
Smith-Stark's preliminary work isflawedin a number of respects. Most importantly, he did not develop an argument and evidence to indicate that these features could be identified and ordered independently of considerations of plurality (cf. Smith-Stark, 1974, pp. 662-67). As will be discussed below, this argument is important so that the approach does not become tautological. There are minor problems as well: in many

cases his analysis is based on scanty data; some of his features are not of the same order as others (for example, [Â± neuter] would not usually be considered a referential feature). Despite these various problems, Smith-Stark's work seems sufficient to indicate that with additional research a richer set of well-grounded features can be developed to characterize differences among languages in scope of pluralization and that additional languages can be compared in the way Yucatec and English have been compared above.
The format of table 13 can be expanded to accommodate such additional features. Table 14 shows such an expanded format incorporating for illustration a couple of additional features proposed by SmithStark. Because it becomes increasingly cumbersome to list the features at the head of each column, the features themselves have been listed to the left and only the positive and negative specifications entered at the column heads. The scope of application of pluralization for several

languages is then indicated below by indicating the range of lexical noun phrase types which are obligatorily pluralized ("yes") and which not ("no"). More details could be incorporated into such a display if we wanted to indicate the full range of relevant detail such as the possibility of facultative plurals, the formal nature of the plural mark (for example, inflection or concord), or the different types of plural (for example, duals or paucals) within a language.
It should be clear at this point that many additional languages can be incorporated into the analysis proposed here for English and Yucatec. This insures that cognitive implications developed in chapter 3 on the basis of the differences between these two languages can be developed for many other languages as well. We are dealing in the present instance, then, with differences between languages, but not isolated, idiosyncratic differences. In fact, although it is not on the agenda here, it is only against such a typological backdrop that isolated, idiosyncratic differences can eventually be analyzed as such and welded to a more culturally specific set of implications.
Developing appropriate referential features
In the previous discussion, referential features, related to one another in terms of markedness relations, were used to characterize the various noun phrase types. These referential features were to be developed independently of the facts of plural marking so that they could be used not merely to provide an alternative description of those patterns but also, in a limited sense, to account for them as well. But no argument was given as to how to find and order such features in a principled manner independently of the facts of number marking. Indeed, a full explanation of the procedures involved in defining such features would take us well beyond the scope of the present study and is certainly not necessary for understanding the basic contrast between Yucatec and English. But, in order to indicate how referential features suitable for characterizing noun phrase types can in fact be developed, the present section briefly sketches the procedure and provides an illustration of such a set of features developed for case marking.
General procedure for developing referential features and characterizing noun phrase types
A strategy for developing a general cross-linguistic characterization of noun phrase types in terms of features of referential meaning has been

66 Grammatical categories and cognition
developed by Silverstein (1976, 1981,1986, 1987). Only key elements of his approach relevant to identifying and ordering referential features will be schematized here.
We first need to recognize what sorts of features we want. Every noun phrase can be characterized by a large number of referential features, but not all those features are grammatically relevant. So, for example, [+ wheeled] might be considered to be a feature of meaning inherent in the noun phrase the wagon, but it is not a good candidate for our feature space since it has no syntactic significance, that is, no grammatical category is ever contingent on its value. When we seek features of noun phrase reference which might govern plural marking, then, we want features which are inherent to noun phrase meaning and which have attested value as grammatically relevant. The process of developing such features typically begins, then, by identifying common referential values inhering to noun phrase groups created by patterns of formal morphosyntactic distribution within various individual languages.
Second, the analysis of these morphosyntactic distributions is undertaken within the framework of marking theory. This involves attending to such factors as the regularity and ubiquity of formal expression of categories and the behavior of one category with respect to others under neutralization (suspension) where the emergent patterns "constitute diagnostic considerations leading to an hypothesis about markedness structure" (Silverstein, 1987, p. 18). (The general strategy of analysis involved in establishing marking relations cannot be elaborated here. See the discussions in Greenberg, 1966; Lyons, 1968, pp. 79-80, also pp. 120-27; Silverstein, 1976, pp. 116-22; 1986, 1987.) The features emergent from such an analysis, as we have seen above, are asymmetric in an important respect: a noun phrase marked [+f] specifically indicates that the given feature of referential meaning is present whereas a noun phrase not so marked, that is, [- f], is neutral as to whether the feature is present or not (i.e., the given meaning is not specified at all - either positively or negatively). (Under appropriate conditions of usage this failure to specify may be taken by speakers as a positive indication of negative specification.) Further, the relationship among features (or the morphosyntactic categories they govern) is also typically asymmetric: one of the two morphosyntactically significant features (categories) is relevant only when the other is not. Typically, a more general feature of meaning (category) is signaled only when a more specific feature is not signaled.
The patterns of marking (or neutralization) among feature categories within a language allow them to be ordered with respect to one another. Some features do not stand in a marking relationship to one another usually within well-defined limits - and give the appearance of being freely cross-cutting binary features. Such features actually define distinct

Comparison of grammatical categories 67
subspaces (orthogonal dimensions) of referential meaning, and these subspaces can also be ordered with respect to one another by reference to their expression (or neutralization).
Third, since we want these features to serve for comparisons across a variety of languages, it becomes crucial to compare similar morphosyntactic groupings and to extract, when possible, a common recurring referential feature value. This extraction of a cross-linguistic notional core {ox salient contrast2*) to characterize the commonality among groups is no simple task and an appropriate characterization may not be obvious. In general these core values will not be definable with reference to the distributional facts of any one language. Nor will they necessarily correspond precisely to some set, extralinguistic property of the referents themselves (for example, psychophysically defined "color"). Rather, these core values will characterize objects of reference as their properties are relevant to the morphosyntactic patterns of a range of languages. (Notice, however, that a given cross-linguistically valid feature may not be functional in every language, that is, no morphosyntactic distribution may be contingent on such a feature in a particular language.) By calibrating the language-specific feature orderings with reference to these notional similarities, a composite cross-linguistic ordering of features and subspaces can be produced.
Fourth, in principle, we would like the features to be developed and ordered independently of the specific grammatical pattern at issue number marking in the present case. Only if the referential feature is independently defined can it be used to account for the pattern of distribution. So, for example, a feature [+count] cannot account for pluralization patterns in English because it can only be defined in the first place relative to the specific distributional patterns of pluralization in English. This independence can be secured by defining the features relative to a variety of other grammatical categories in a broad sample of languages. Since sets of referential features can be built one by one for each of the various morphosyntactic categories relevant to the noun phrase, however, the process ultimately becomes circular in one sense: features relevant to the description of each category are derived from all the others and vice versa. The features are nonetheless ultimately defined relative to the overall constellation of grammatical categories in many languages and remain, from this point of view, independent of any particular category and any particular language. In fact, since only one category is being excluded ("controlled for") each time, considerable overlap among the features is virtually guaranteed, and it may be possible to develop a core set of features ordering the space as a whole.
Finally, combinations of features define possible noun phrase types of cross-linguistic significance. That is, by analogy with phonological pro-

68 Grammatical categories and cognition
cesses where each phoneme consists of a "bundle" of distinctive feature values of sound, we may characterize each noun phrase type (A, B, C . . . in table 14) as a bundle of distinctive feature values of reference (a, b, c . . . in table 14). The overall ordering of features and subspaces allows these noun phrase types themselves to be ordered. Various patterns of morphosyntactic marking such as case marking and number marking can be characterized in terms of their scope of application with respect to such an ordering of noun phrase types.
An illustration: Silverstein's feature space for case marking
As discussed in Language diversity and thought, chapter 4, Silverstein (1973, 1976, 1981, 1986, 1987) has built such a feature representation to account for some of the patterns of case marking of noun phrases evidenced in languages. In his approach the features are defined and ordered independently of the facts of case marking itself, so they constitute an independent variable from the point of view of case marking.25 Various generalizations about case marking - in particular the regular splits of case marking between nominative-accusative and ergative-absolutive paradigms - are then shown to be readily characterizable in terms of the resultant ordering of noun phrase types derivative from the hierarchical ordering of referential features. Silverstein (1986) has suggested that similar spaces can be constructed for other grammatical categories.
Table 15 reproduces Silverstein's (1981; see also 1986, 1987) feature space. To the left is the hierarchically ordered list of features. To the right are various columns each corresponding to a combination or intersection of relevant feature specifications which serve to characterize a given type of noun phrase A, B, C, etc.26 By consistently placing the positive feature specifications toward the top of the vertical feature axis, an ordering of noun phrase types is produced. (The apparent violation of this convention in the diagram with features b through d - creating the appearance of cross-cutting features - is due to the two dimensional layout of the space. With additional dimensions, the positive feature values would be contiguous - bunched around the axis.) A provisional label for each noun phrase type (A, B, C, etc.) is given in the table. For the purposes of comparison, the subset of features and noun phrase types developed for grammatical number in table 14 has been marked within the space in order to clarify the way these features might be situated within a larger scheme.
Silverstein's feature space for case marking cannot simply be borrowed directly for use with number marking for several reasons. First, the

Comparison of grammatical categories 69 Table 15. Silverstein's two-dimensional(iHierarchical array of noun phrase types in referential feature-space (approximation)"

Silverstein (1981, p. 240, table 1). Features discussed in the current study are enclosed in the L-shaped box. feature spaces for different categories need not be identical; features relevant to case marking need not be relevant to number marking although, as indicated above, one can expect considerable overlap. Second, and more specifically, Silverstein's array actually includes features such as [Â± unique], [Â± plural], [Â± enumerable] that directly refer to the number status of indexical noun phrases and that cannot, therefore, be taken as independent variables in characterizing number marking.27 Third, number marking has been taken into account in the ordering of the features and so the array cannot be construed as independent of number even if the obvious features such as [Â± plural] were eliminated. A new set of features needs to be articulated for number marking (and each other grammatical category of interest) such that the target category's patterning is kept out of the feature defining and ordering process.

70 Grammatical categories and cognition
An aside: Silverstein's interpretation of the ordering of noun phrase types
An important issue is whether the noun phrase ordering articulated in table 15 is interpretable, that is, whether one or more notional principles can be articulated which correspond to the ordered array of noun phrase types A, B, C, etc. As Silverstein indicates in the bracketed labels above the ordered noun phrase types in table 15, various nested subgroups of the noun phrase types can be given coherent interpretation. Each subsequent layer of the nesting includes all the groupings at lower levels and adds further noun phrase types by loosening the criterion of inclusion. The question of what orders the noun phrase types then becomes one of what principle governs the criteria of inclusion.
The noun phrase types to the left in the table are forms which depend on the immediate context of speech for their interpretation: pronouns and various anaphoric and deictic forms. This suggests that the ordering is linked in some way to speech events themselves, in contrast, for example, to context-independent properties of the objects of reference. As we move to the right (O, P, Q, etc.), the link to the immediate speech event becomes weaker. It is this ordering which provides the key to Silverstein's interpretation.28 He introduced the notion that the selfreferential quality of speech, that is, the ability of the forms to refer to their own relationship to the speech situation, is reflected in the ordering. Silverstein's (1981) initial29 proposal was that the ordering of noun phrase types reflects the degree to which a given type of noun phrase both indexes something about the speech event in which it occurs and simultaneously refers to the nature of that indexical relationship itself. He expressed this in more technical terms as follows:
It would appear that, insofar as the markedness of noun phrase categorizations is concerned, languages follow an ordering principle based on what we can term
THE UNAVOIDABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF METAPRAGMATIC REFERENCE. T h i s Can
be explained as follows. That language signs are used in contexts of situated social encounters is, of
course, a truism; let us restrict the usage of the term 'pragmatic' to the study of such relationships, indexical relationships, between signs and their contexts of occurrence . . . Then any linguistic forms that essentially describe (refer-to and/or predicate-of) the very terms of such indexical relationships are inherently 'metapragmatic' (employing the ordinary formation with prefix 'meta-'). In particular, any referring form in language, whose instantiation in speech at once indexes and describes its counterpart term in an indexical relationship [for example, the pronoun /], is unavoidably and transparently metapragmatic. Note that for such a form to occur felicitously, its use must presuppose the existence of the contextual entity it indexes (lest it be a pragmatic misfire), and at the same time its use achieves consummated reference to the contextual entity.
(1981, p. 241)

Comparison of grammatical categories 71
Thus, in Silverstein's account noun phrases bear indexical relationships to socially situated speech events. The degree to which noun phrases guarantee or express this relationship as part of their referential meaning when they are used gives rise to their position in the noun phrase ordering.
Another way of expressing this regularity is to say that socially situated speech itself is the ground against which noun phrase types are ordered:
To be interpretive for a moment, it is as if language use itself in the instant of referring, an activity with an 'agent'-'recipient'-'instrument/vehicle' structure in the speaker-addressee-signal roles, were the creative structuring model against which unavoidable transparency of metapragmatic referentiality is measured by the markedness system of noun phrase categories. (Silverstein, 1981, p. 242)
This is an important claim for it indicates directly what is distinctive about linguistic categories: they take speech (or speaking) as their ground. "The reference space . . . is not a model of entities in the world that happen to become potential denotata of language" nor "a model of some pre-linguistic 'reality,'" but rather a model of "the way language structures its presentation of denotata through coding categories of Noun Phrase form" (1987, p. 30). A deeper analysis of number marking will have to proceed in this direction by searching for a characterization of the morphosyntactic value of pluralization not solely in terms of decontextualized semantic values but in terms of its role in the pragmatic and metapragmatic dimensions of discourse.
In recent work, Silverstein (1987) has provided a more detailed semiotic-functional interpretation of the noun phrase ordering, in terms of the different weightings of certain basic conditions on correspondence (bases for reference) across different groups of noun phrase types. This approach is especially promising in that it both indicates the dominant factor apparently governing the placement of a noun phrase in the ordering, and also accounts for the possibility of meaningful variation in, and manipulation of, specific noun phrase reference. For example, this approach promises to give a more direct account of the shift in fundamental referential value of lexical nouns from units to kinds across the ordering, and also of the possibility of both kinds of reference occurring at both ends of the continuum.
Summary of the contrastive analysis
Yucatec and English use similar morphosyntactic devices to mark pluralization, but they are implemented quite differently. The Yucatec marking is optionally applied to a small range of noun phrases whereas

72 Grammatical categories and cognition
the English marking is obligatorily applied to a larger range of noun phrases. A characterization in terms of typical application of the plural marking can capture these distributional facts in a single representation. Examination of this representation suggests that a notional characterization can be given to the scope of pluralization in terms of differences in the inherent meaning values of various noun phrase types. The discussion proposed two referential features that adequately characterize the three noun phrase types relevant to the Yucatec and English comparison and then illustrated how such an analysis can be extended to encompass additional languages and additional features. The concluding section discussed important elements of Silverstein's general procedure for developing such features. Brief mention was also made of his attempts to interpret the emerging ordered array of noun phrase types.
Contrast in singular marking (numeral modification and unitization)
Whereas English establishes Singular indefinite reference with the indefinite article a (~ an) (including here various indexical uses of the form one) or with one of various quantitative modifiers, Yucatec usually establishes Singular indefinite reference by a single modifier type consisting of the numeral prefix "un- 'one' in conjunction with a numeral classifier. So the key difference between the two languages lies in the existence and obligatory use of numeral classifier constructions in Yucatec - in particular in those cases where English requires only the indefinite article. This discussion will center on explaining the functioning of the classifier forms in Yucatec and their implications for Yucatec lexical and grammatical structure.
Clarifying the contrast between English and Yucatec
Why does Yucatec require numeral classifiers whereas English and other related languages of Europe do not? What function do the classifiers serve in the grammar? The concern here is not with the use of any given classifier, but with the reasons for the existence of the whole set of forms. Although an exhaustive account will not be developed here, it will be possible to indicate in a general way the semiotic function of the system and the logic of its operation. The approach of the present analysis will be comparative, that is, Yucatec Maya will be compared with other nonclassifier languages such as English for functionally analogous structures, and with other classifier languages such as Chinese for formally anal-

Comparison of grammatical categories 73
ogous structures. A crucial cross-linguistic regularity will then be articulated which allows the two types of languages to be encompassed in a unified way in regard to both their similarities and their differences.
Comparison with non-classifier languages
Semantic value in the proposition. The first and most obvious characteristic of the classifiers is that they are necessary for enumeration. This suggests that lexical nouns could not be modified by a numeral (or their referents enumerated) without them. If we look to English for parallels, we find a similar phenomenon in those lexical nouns such as zinc and cotton which are not usually modified by a numeral, for example, *two zincs, *two cottons. These lexical nouns have traditionally been called "mass" nouns (i.e., when they are noun phrase heads, the noun phrase is always neutral). Such mass nouns are generally conceptualized as lacking any intrinsic specification of unit as part of their referential meaning. Since such a unit would be necessary for enumeration of the referent of the noun, a unit must be explicitly specified by some additional morphological forms - typically of phrasal form: two blocks of zinc, two balls of cotton. (See Lyons, 1977, p. 462.) The morphosyntactic process which converts the lexical noun phrase into one which explicitly signals the unit of the referent can be called unitization, and the specific forms used (phrasal modifiers in this case) can be called unitizers or unitizer constructions. Each mass noun in English is typically compatible with an array of different unitizers.30
This interpretation of English mass nouns can illuminate the pattern of numeral modification for Yucatec lexical nouns. It suggests, by analogy, that all the lexical nouns of Yucatec are unspecified as to unit since they all require supplementary marking (i.e., numeral classifiers) in the context of numeral modification.31 Under this analysis, the numeral classifiers serve to specify the unit or boundedness of the referent of the lexical noun, that is, they are unitizers which supplement the meaning of the lexical noun head so that it will accept numeral modification. We can say, then, that the difference between the two languages is really one of scope (or range) of lexical nouns requiring unitization in order to be suitable for numeral modification: English requires unitization for a limited range of lexical nouns whereas Yucatec requires unitization for all lexical nouns.
This interpretation, that Yucatec lexical nouns are unspecified as to unit and somewhat like English mass nouns, is consistent with the fact that lexical noun phrases in Yucatec do not require pluralization in the context of reference to a multiplicity of entities. If the lexical noun does

74 Grammatical categories and cognition
not inherently signal a specific unit, then the multiplicity of these units is not semantically relevant - at least on these grounds. If the expression of multiplicity is pragmatically important, of course, it can be signaled optionally. But if this interpretation is correct, then the plural itself in Yucatec must have a somewhat different meaning than the plural in English in that it need not apply to, or signal, multiple units as such, but rather some looser notion of quantity - somewhat equivalent to our expression lots of. Significantly, the general adjective modifier for quantity, yffab9 'much, many', also conforms to this pattern of indifference to presence of a unit.
Also consistent with this interpretation is the fact that Yucatec lexical forms often include a range of meanings which would be subdivided into separate, and semantically quite different, lexical items in English. For example, the word che9 'wood' is used not only to refer to the material itself, but also to refer to a variety of objects that are composed of wood and have distinctive shapes such as 'tree, stick, board'. English, by contrast, as the preceding translation equivalents indicate, can focus on the distinctive shapes by using a different lexical item for each (i.e., they conflate unit and material into a single lexical form). Yucatec lexical nouns can be used in conjunction with a classifier to approximate the referential values of the various English lexical items:
9un-t9iit che9 'one stick [lit. 1-dimensional unit] of wood'. Most Yucatec nouns can combine with a variety of different classifiers just as the English mass nouns can enter a variety of phrasal forms. For example, consider the following set of forms:
9un-t9iit ha'as 'one/a 1-dimens. banana (i.e., the fruit)', 'un-wdal ha'as 'one/a 2-dimens. banana (i.e., the leaf)', 9un-p9eel ha?as 'one/a 3-dimens. banana (e.g., the fruit)', 9un-kuul ha9as 'one/a planted banana (i.e., the tree)', 9un-kuuch ha'as 'one/a load banana (i.e., the bunch)', 'um-p'iit ha9as 'a-little-bit-of/some banana'. Again, as in the example with che9 ('wood'), it is as if these Yucatec lexical forms have reference to a common material or substance that may take a variety of manifest shapes or forms.32 From an interpretive point of view the classifiers resemble the inflectional category of aspect in the verb phrase which gives the logical or temporal perspective being applied to or presupposed of the predicate. Numeral classifiers clarify the logical or spatial perspective being applied to, or presupposed of, the noun phrase complement. In this way Yucatec speakers achieve by means of a single grammatical formation what English speakers achieve by a combination of lexical alternation, determiners, and quantitative modifiers. With this specific dimension of noun phrase meaning isolated in a separate morpheme, Ihe opportunity is created for manipulation of this

Comparison of grammatical categories 75
dimension to signal subtle referential distinctions. For example, in the following pair of expressions the classifier -tuul usually associated with animate entities is in opposition with the most neutral classifier -p'eel:
'un-tuul noh-och mdak 'one old man (known to me)', 'um-p'eeh noh-och mdak 'one old man (not known to me)'. Many such alternations are pragmatically conditioned, that is, depend on the immediate context of use for their effect, and a given opposition may represent a different meaning in a different conversational context.
Pragmatic value in discourse. Yucatec numeral classifiers also serve pragmatic, or discourse-based functions. The numeral one (9un- or one of its variants) along with a classifier is used to indicate that a new item is being introduced into discourse. These forms thus bridge the propositional and discourse levels. By indicating additional semantic information at the propositional level, they effectively signal at the discourse level that the item is not already present and/or presupposable (definite) in the speech context. In many ways these constructions are quite similar in their usage to the indefinite articles in English (a âan). This suggests, then, that the classifiers play a crucial role in establishing reference.
Numeral plus classifier constructions (i.e., standing alone without an associated lexical noun) can also serve in deictic and anaphoric uses. This means that they refer by virtue of indexing something in the immediate context (whether non-speech or previous speech) hence their referential value can only be computed by reference to that context. In this they follow closely the usage of one in English. For example, tdas ten 'un-t'iit chamal 'bring me a (1-dimensional) cigarette' would, in appropriate contexts, routinely be reduced to tdas ten 'un-0'iit 'bring me one (1-dimensional)'.
However, as should be clear, these forms carry a greater semantic load than similar English forms precisely because each one represents a selection from a much larger array of possibilities. It is as if Yucatec has a whole array of indefinite article forms where English has only a two way alternation of a (~ an ~ one) versus some (~ 0). In these cases the additional semantic information signaled by the numeral classifier construction is exploited to help establish and maintain reference. Attempts to analyze the use of classifiers purely in terms of their contribution to propositional value will be inadequate, just as similar attempts to characterize English determiners in such terms have been.
Comparison with other classifier languages
Other languages which have numeral classifiers show patterns parallel to those characteristic of Yucatec numeral classifiers. In particular,

76 Grammatical categories and cognition
individual lexical items in these languages have a type of reference that is consistent with their being neutral as to intrinsic unit. Classifiers typically provide such a unit for numeral modification and many nouns can occur with more than one classifier, each of which produces a different semantic effect. At the discourse level, in almost every language with genuine numeral classifiers, these forms with their associated numerals can be used as deictic or anaphoric forms. Thus, both the semantic and the discourse level functioning of the Yucatec forms are not isolated and idiosyncratic phenomena, but rather perfectly regular characteristics of many languages.
Another common claim about numeral classifiers deserves mention. Most analysts divide numeral classifiers into two broad groups: sortal and mensural (Lyons, 1977, pp. 463-64). Sortal classifiers apply to "whole" entities and sort them into "classes." Mensural classifiers indicate the "measure" or "quantity" of some amorphous substance.33 One characteristic of the sortal classifiers is that there is usually a very general classifier, somewhat neutral in its sense, which can be applied in place of any of the sortals with the possible exception of the classifier(s) for animate entities (Greenberg, 1972). This pattern is most closely paralleled in Yucatec by -p'eel which can be used for reference to almost any object where a "sortal" classifier would be expected, although it is not usually used to substitute for cases where -tuul would be appropriate, that is, for reference to most animate objects. In Yucatec, then, a class much like the sortals can be detected by identifying those lexical nouns that are compatible with one of the two general classifiers -tuul 'animate' and -p'eel 'three dimensional [formally and notionally unmarked]' supplemented by the pattern of interaction with the quantitative adjective t'ee^ek 'few'. There is a second very general classifier -p'iit 'a little bit of, a few' which can be used in almost every case where mensural classifiers could be used. Many nouns (especially edible plants and animals) fit both categories because -p'iit itself is neutral with respect to unit and can cover the two English senses 'a little bit of and 'a few'.
Outside of certain restrictions on compatibility with other classifiers, little in the grammar of Yucatec appears to hinge on, or correlate with, this "sortal" (-tuul/-p9eel) versus "mensural" (-p'iit) distinction, and it is difficult to know what status it should be given. But it is interesting that groups of lexical nouns compatible with the three general classifiers correspond roughly to those serving as heads of the three lexical noun phrase types ("animates," "objects," and "materials") developed in the analysis of pluralization patterns. This suggests that something like a three way split of lexical noun types operates within the sphere of unitization as well.

Interrelationship between pluralization and unitization
A striking fact which emerges when we examine numeral classifier languages is that there is a general absence of obligatory pluralization. Sanches ([with Slobin], 1973; see also Greenberg, 1972,1978; Gil, 1987) has shown that, in those languages which have numeral classifiers for all or nearly all nouns, obligatory pluralization is usually either absent or infrequent.34 Since we have seen that the scope of typical pluralization varies as a function of noun phrase type, and that there is interesting variation within classifier systems by lexical noun type, it is reasonable to ask whether a more precise specification of this complementary relationship between these two grammatical phenomena can be achieved by working at the noun phrase level.
We can explore such a possibility with Yucatec and English by using the three noun phrase types developed earlier. To accomplish the comparison, we need to shift our focus to obligatory pluralization and we need to treat English quantitative phrasal constructions as unitizer constructions that are functionally equivalent to Yucatec numeral classifiers. We can then characterize the scope of obligatory unitization by noun phrase type in the two languages and ask about its relationship to the scope of obligatory pluralization by noun phrase type.35 Table 16 portrays the relationship that obtains between these grammatical patterns in English and Yucatec using the referential features and noun phrase types developed earlier. The complementary relationship between these two patterns emerges clearly: not only is there a global difference in that Yucatec tends to obligatorily unitize across the whole spectrum of lexical noun phrase types which are not obligatorily plural-

ized, but also a pattern exists in English of unitizing precisely for those lexical nouns that do not take obligatory pluralization. This pattern indicates the close relationship between unitization and pluralization and the appropriateness of treating numeral modification as part of the number marking system of a language. It also indicates the close relationship between grammatical number marking patterns and lexical noun phrase structure - and vice versa. The semantic structure of lexical noun heads is ultimately at issue.

Generalizing the analysis for further comparisons
Sanches's work suggests that the complementary relationship between numeral classifiers and pluralization is a general phenomenon. The discussion in the previous section suggests that the analysis can be made more precise by examining the relationship in terms of noun phrase types and can be broadened to incorporate nonclassifier forms of unitization. However, in the absence of previous work examining this problem in terms of noun phrase types, only a few general suggestions can be made at present as to how the analysis can be extended to other languages and features.

Comparison of grammatical categories 79
Generalizing to additional languages
The complementary distribution of unitization and pluralization at the noun phrase level apparently holds for at least some additional languages. Table 17 shows the complementary distribution of obligatory pluralization and obligatory unitization for the set of languages used earlier in terms of the same three noun phrase types. For languages such as Tarascan that have both obligatory pluralization and true numeral classifiers, a statement of the complementary distribution of these two marking patterns by noun phrase type has the advantage of more adequately characterizing such languages. By contrast, in Sanches's comparison at the level of whole languages, such languages appear to be anomalous.
Although much more work would be required to fully document and qualify the generality of such a complementary distribution, these data should be sufficient to indicate that the differences between Yucatec and English are not mere local, accidental phenomena, but rather form part of a much larger, cross-linguistic regularity. This regularity seems to center on an interaction between patterns of number marking and fundamental structure of lexical nouns.
Building a more general feature analysis
In the immediately preceding discussion, the features characterizing the scope of unitization and its complementary relationship with pluralization were borrowed from the analysis of plural marking because they were appropriate. It is likely, however, that a larger set of features will be required to characterize a larger sample of languages and, in fact, to treat some of the languages in table 17 more adequately. It also may be possible that the features relevant to bounding the scope of unitization may not in fact generally correspond to those bounding the scope of pluralization, so it is desirable to distinguish the two sets of features until this is established. I know of no previous attempts to characterize the scope of application of unitization in general or of numeral classifiers in particular, and no further attempt to develop such an analysis will be made here since it is not necessary for the present contrast between Yucatec and English. The previous discussion of the procedures for extending the analysis of pluralization can, however, serve to indicate the general course such an analysis would have to take.
There have been a number of works attempting to generalize about the sorts of referential meanings involved within numeral classifier systems (for example, Allan, 1977; Denny, 1976, 1979). These deserve some

80 Grammatical categories and cognition
comment both because they differ somewhat from the approach favored here and because they hold important implications for the interpretation of the semantic structure of lexical nouns. These accounts all suffer from a set of common weaknesses.
First, they all tend to assume that classifiers reflect something about the lexical noun rather than contributing new information to the meaning of the noun phrase. Attention is confined to some purported common value of the lexical items associated with the classifier (or, worse yet, to a simple list of such lexical items) rather than being extended to the actual change in referential value entailed by the application of the classifier. Co-occurence relations with lexical nouns can provide clues to the meaning of the classifier by suggesting contexts in which their meaning values are relevant, but the meaning of the classifier cannot be reduced to the common value of the lexical items. In short, the fundamental role of the classifier in the grammar typically goes unrecognized.
Second, and relatedly, they do not recognize a linkage between the need for classifiers in numeral modification and the overall structure of the grammar as expressed in the inherent semantic structure of lexical items and other number marking patterns, such as pluralization. Thus, classifier systems are analyzed on their own terms without reference to the rest of the grammar and the contribution of the classifiers to the coherent system of reference is often not recognized.
Third, within the analyses, they seek a set of decontextualized semantic features and do not incorporate features sensitive to the immediate and/or cultural context of speech. Use of a classifier to augment the inherent meaning of the lexical noun provides the opportunity not only for semantic modification, but also for pragmatic modification - for example to signal the introduction of a new referent in discourse or to suggest speaker attitude towards the referent. In short, the pragmatic potential of classifiers to tailor the reference of the modified lexical noun head and the utterance as a whole to the context (including the view or perspective of the speaker) is simply ignored.
One extended example from Yucatec can serve to illustrate these points. One of the most commonly recognized aspects of classifier systems is the presence in most such languages of a separate classifier co-occurring with lexical nouns referring to animate entities. The classifier -tuul in Yucatec is such a form:
'un-tiiul k'eek'-en 'one/a live pig'.36
The usual claim about such forms is that k'eek'-en 'pig' is an animate noun and therefore it "takes" the animate classifier. In this sort of analysis, the classifier contributes nothing to the meaning of the utterance. Classifiers are essentially construed as if they were empty formal

Comparison of grammatical categories 81

categories that merely agree with the lexical noun head. If, however, the classifiers as a group signaled such a purely formal category, then we might expect a given noun to take only one classifier. This by no means occurs: many lexical nouns can take a variety of classifiers which produce clear and reliable shifts in meaning. For example, k'eek'-en can take the following meanings with some other classifiers:

'um-p'eel k'eek'-en 'um-p'iit k'eek'-en 'un-seet' k'eek'-en

'one/a whole pig (dead or alive)', 'a-little-bit-of/some pork', 'one/a piece/shred of pork'.

One way to account for this variability is to suggest that classifiers have typical uses which are extended analogically. For example when an animate classifier form is applied to non-animate lexical nouns it suggests that they are "like animates" by virtue of their typical use.37 For example, -tuul sometimes occurs with inanimates:

'un-tuul camion 'a/one truck [Spanish loan]', 'un-tuul boton 'a/one button [Spanish loan]'.

The claim would be that, in the specific circumstances of use, the truck and button in question were regarded as being like animates in some way: the truck passed by under its own power, the button popped from thefingersof the person attempting to sew it on. This approach explains the extension of the syntactic distribution of the classifier, but still leaves the classifier without significant referential value. This is a less than satisfying explanation for the existence and functioning of a highly regular and obligatory pattern of syntactic marking: the exceptional applications of the classifier are meaningful, but the routine uses are not.
The obvious alternative is to attribute to the classifier itself some referential value. For example, one could attribute the meaning "animate" to the classifier itself so that it makes any noun phrase containing it animate as well. This leaves the relevant lexical nouns without a semantic value of [+animate] (i.e., they are [âanimate], or neutral, if some nouns are so marked or, if none are, then the feature is simply not relevant at all) unless it is provided by one of the classifiers. This may strike us, as speakers of English, as odd, but it is not at all implausible given the operation of the classifier constructions in these languages. For example, the lexical item k'eek'en used in the above example can refer without any special marking to 'dead pigs' and 'pork' which suggests that animacy is not a necessary element of its meaning: tdal-en in-mdan k'eek'en 'I have come to buy a/some pig/pork'.38 If the lexical noun k'eek'en is neutral with respect to animacy and the classifier -tuul provides this dimension of meaning, then 'un-tuul k'eek'en refers to a living, animate pig by virtue of -tuul, not by virtue of the meaning of k'eek'en. And some alternative such as 'um-p'eel k'eek'en 'a/one whole

82 Grammatical categories and cognition
pig' or 'un-seef k'eek'en 'one piece/shred of pork' can be used to refer to a dead pig.39
One problem with this analysis is that it puts us in the position of saying that every item occurring with -tuul is being specified [+ animate]; so, for example, the truck and the button referred to in the examples given above would be marked [+animate]. This is fine if we understand [+animate] in the technical sense indicated above as a label for the volitional, agentive, or motive properties of a referent.
An alternative to this latter proposal is to argue that the classifier does contribute something to the meaning of the lexical noun phrase but that it is not [+animate]. For example, one might claim that -tuul signals a feature such as [4-mobile] or [+self-segmenting] where these are to be understood as defined relative to a specific event of speaking and not as a permanent attribute of an object. This use of a notinherent-to-the-referent feature accords well with the perspectivesignaling character of numeral classifiers.40 Thus one could regard particular referents such as trucks which pass by on their own power or buttons which slip from one's hand as [+ mobile] or [+ self-segmenting] in a particular speech context without having to regard the lexical nouns used for denoting trucks or buttons as being inherently [+ mobile] or [+self-segmenting]. This approach also squares with the availability of a variety of classifiers for each lexical noun since the relevant unit appropriate for enumeration may vary by the referential context. Of course, most of the time such a description would be applicable to animate referents and therefore occur with the lexical nouns referring to them. This would account for the strong association of -tuul with such lexical nouns in Yucatec. But notice, now, under this interpretation, that it is not the classifier alone nor the lexical noun alone that indicates (or suggests) animateness, but rather such a meaning is deducible from their joint operation.
Either of these last two solutions seems preferable to leaving the classifier semantically empty (at least in the usual case). These approaches also incorporate a crucial shift of emphasis towards considering the classifier as a creative referential device signaling meaningful information in the noun phrase, and support the view that the appropriate level of analysis for cross-linguistic analysis of number marking is the noun phrase and not the lexical noun.
Summary of the contrastive analysis
Singular marking in Yucatec is basically accomplished by means of modifiers consisting of a numeral plus classifier combination. By contrast

Comparison of grammatical categories 83
English uses the indefinite article and/or quantitative modifiers. The pattern in Yucatec is functionally similar to that used for mass nouns in English, and this relationship is used to suggest that Yucatec lexical nouns are all inherently unspecified for unit. The Yucatec pattern of lacking obligatory pluralization is also consistent with other classifier languages. Combined comparison of the two languages shows a complementary relationship across noun phrase types in the requirement of obligatory unitization and the requirement of obligatory pluralization. This analysis in terms of the two features developed for pluralization can be extended to some other languages, although there is as yet no generally worked out set of features governing the scope of unitization. The discussion closes by recognizing the need to assign referential feature values to classifiers and some of the difficulties in doing so.
General summary
The number marking systems of the two languages show a number of striking convergences. Plural and Singular are marked using similar morphosyntactic devices. Yet when we look more closely, we find that the languages differ in which elements of structure require obligatory, overt specification and which do not. The two analyses together suggest some fundamental asymmetries of structure at the level of lexical nouns. Interpretively, in Yucatec all nouns are like our mass nouns in that they are neutral with respect to logical unit or shape. Although individual classifiers may appear and disappear within Yucatec, it would require a major restructuring of the grammar to eliminate classifiers altogether. This lexical structure is consistent with the obligatory unitization to indicate Singular (and specific quantitative multiples) and with the optionality of Plural marking. English divides its lexical nouns into two groups, those with a presupposable unit as part of lexical structure and which may take Plurals and Singular marking with indefinite article, and those lexical nouns which function like the Yucatec lexical nouns in requiring unitizers and lacking the plural.
Much more could be said to make these generalizations more specific and to explore their further ramifications in morphosyntactic structure. But the analysis presented thus far should be sufficient to meet the criteria established for the current project. We have identified a difference in morphosyntactic structuring that corresponds with a significant difference in the referential meaning value of fundamental forms in the two languages. The difference penetrates a variety of formal and substantive structural domains in the two languages and reveals an

84 Grammatical categories and cognition
intimate relationship between lexical and syntactic patterning. The comparison has been developed in terms of a "neutral" cross-linguistic descriptive framework which characterizes both commonalities and differences among languages within a unified treatment. And indications have been given as to how the analysis can be extended to other languages.
