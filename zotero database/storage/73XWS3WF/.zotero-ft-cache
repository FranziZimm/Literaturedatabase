Cognitive Linguistics
Cognitive Linguistics argues that language is governed by general cognitive principles, rather than by a special-purpose language module. This introductory textbook surveys the ﬁeld of cognitive linguistics as a distinct area of study, presenting its theoretical foundations and the arguments supporting it. Clearly organized and accessibly written, it provides a useful introduction to the relationship between language and cognitive processing in the human brain. It covers the main topics likely to be encountered in a course or seminar, and provides a synthesis of study and research in this fast-growing ﬁeld of linguistics. The authors begin by explaining the conceptual structures and cognitive processes governing linguistic representation and behavior, and go on to explore cognitive approaches to lexical semantics, as well as syntactic representation and analysis, focusing on the closely related frameworks of cognitive grammar and construction grammar. This much-needed introduction will be welcomed by students in linguistics and cognitive science.
william croft is Professor of Linguistics at the University of Manchester, where he has taught since 1994. His primary areas of research are typology, cognitive linguistics, construction grammar, language change and verbal semantics. He has previously published in this series Typology and Universals, 1st edition (1990), and 2nd edition (2003), and is also the author of Radical Construction Grammar (2001).

Preface
This book provides an overview of the basic principles and methods of cognitive linguistics, in particular as they are applied to semantic and syntactic issues. It is intended to be used as a textbook for a course on cognitive linguistics for advanced undergraduates and postgraduate students, as well as functioning as an introduction to this approach to language for linguists and researchers in neighboring disciplines. Parts I and II may also function as a textbook for a course on cognitive semantics, supplemented by case studies from the cognitive linguistic literature. Part III may also function as introductory reading for a course on construction grammar, followed by readings from the literature that delve into the details of particular theories of construction grammar and the analyses of particular constructions.
The chapters of the book were independently written, but jointly discussed. Croft is responsible for chapters 1–3 and 9–12, and Cruse for chapters 4–8 (this fact will no doubt be obvious to the reader). Cruse also contributed to §3.2.1, and Croft to §8.2. Although we have written our chapters independently, the book represents a single coherent perspective on cognitive linguistics. We agree on all of the major points, and most of the minor ones; what minor disagreements remain do not compromise the integrity of the analysis as a whole.
Croft would like to thank members of the linguistics and psychology departments at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology, Leipzig, Germany, and Jo´hanna Barðdal, Chuck Fillmore, Laura Janda, Paul Kay and Ron Langacker for their comments on earlier versions of Part III, and Liliana Albertazzi and the participants in the Workshop on ‘Which Semantics?,’ Bolzano, Italy, 1995 for their comments on topics dealt with in Part I. Cruse would like to thank Liliana Albertazzi and fellow-participants (George Lakoff, Ron Langacker and Len Talmy) at the Summer School on Cognitive Semantics, Bolzano, Italy, 1999; Arie Verhagen and the students at the LOT Winter School, Leiden, Holland, 2002; and members of the Equipe Rhe´ma, University of Lyon, France, for their comments on various topics dealt with in the book. Last but not least, we both thank the students of successive classes on cognitive linguistics at the University of Manchester, who used materials that eventually became the chapters presented here. Of course, all responsibility for the ﬁnal product remains with us.

Introduction: what is cognitive linguistics?

Cognitive linguistics is taken here to refer to the approach to the study of language that began to emerge in the 1970s and has been increasingly active since the 1980s (now endowed with an international society with biennial conferences and a journal, Cognitive Linguistics). A quarter century later, a vast amount of research has been generated under the name of cognitive linguistics. Most of the research has focused on semantics, but a signiﬁcant proportion also is devoted to syntax and morphology, and there has been cognitive linguistic research into other areas of linguistics such as language acquisition, phonology and historical linguistics. This book can only outline the basic principles of the cognitive linguistic approach and some of its more important results and implications for the study of language. In this chapter, we brieﬂy describe the major hypotheses of cognitive linguistics (as we see them), and how we will develop these hypotheses in the rest of the book.
We see three major hypotheses as guiding the cognitive linguistic approach to language:

r

language is not an autonomous cognitive faculty

r

grammar is conceptualization

r

knowledge of language emerges from language use

These three hypotheses represent a response by the pioneering ﬁgures in cognitive linguistics to the dominant approaches to syntax and semantics at the time, namely generative grammar and truth-conditional (logical) semantics. The ﬁrst principle is opposed to generative grammar’s well-known hypothesis that language is an autonomous (indeed, innate) cognitive faculty or module, separated from nonlinguistic cognitive abilities. The second principle is opposed to truth-conditional semantics, in which a semantic metalanguage is evaluated in terms of truth and falsity relative to the world (or, more precisely, a model of the world). The third principle is opposed to reductionist tendencies in both generative grammar and truth-conditional semantics, in which maximally abstract and general representations of grammatical form and meaning are sought and many grammatical and semantic phenomena are assigned to the ‘periphery’.

Introduction

Generative grammar and truth-conditional semantics are of course still vigorous research paradigms today, and so cognitive linguists continue to present arguments for their basic hypotheses as well as exploring more speciﬁc empirical questions of syntax and semantics within the cognitive linguistic paradigm. Some of these arguments will be presented in the course of this book. Here we describe in somewhat more detail the content of these three hypotheses and how they are manifested in subsequent chapters.
The ﬁrst hypothesis is that language is not an autonomous cognitive faculty. The basic corollaries of this hypothesis are that the representation of linguistic knowledge is essentially the same as the representation of other conceptual structures, and that the processes in which that knowledge is used are not fundamentally different from cognitive abilities that human beings use outside the domain of language.
The ﬁrst corollary is essentially that linguistic knowledge – knowledge of meaning and form – is basically conceptual structure. It is probably not difﬁcult to accept the hypothesis that semantic representation is basically conceptual (though what that entails is a matter of debate; see below). But cognitive linguists argue that syntactic, morphological and phonological representation is also basically conceptual. This might appear counterintuitive at ﬁrst: sounds are physical entities, and ultimately so are utterances and their formal structure. But sounds and utterances must be comprehended and produced, and both of those processes involve the mind. Sounds and utterances are the input and output of cognitive processes that govern speaking and understanding.
The second corollary is that the cognitive processes that govern language use, in particular the construction and communication of meaning by language, are in principle the same as other cognitive abilities. That is, the organization and retrieval of linguistic knowledge is not signiﬁcantly different from the organization and retrieval of other knowledge in the mind, and the cognitive abilities that we apply to speaking and understanding language are not signiﬁcantly different from those applied to other cognitive tasks, such as visual perception, reasoning or motor activity. Language is a distinct human cognitive ability, to be sure. From a cognitive perspective, language is the real-time perception and production of a temporal sequence of discrete, structured symbolic units. This particular conﬁguration of cognitive abilities is probably unique to language, but the component cognitive skills required are not.
This position is sometimes taken as a denial of an innate human capacity for language. This is not the case; it is only a denial of an autonomous, special-purpose innate human capacity for language. It is of course reasonable to assume that there is a signiﬁcant innate component to general human cognitive abilities, and that some of those innate properties give rise to human linguistic abilities that no other

species apparently has. However, innateness of cognitive abilities has not been a chief concern of cognitive linguists, who are more concerned with demonstrating the role of general cognitive abilities in language.
The hypothesis that language is not an autonomous cognitive faculty has had two major implications for cognitive linguistic research. Much cognitive linguistic research has been devoted to elucidating conceptual structure and cognitive abilities as they are seen to apply to language, in the effort to demonstrate that language can be adequately modeled using just these general conceptual structures and cognitive abilities. Part I of this book is devoted to explicating cognitive linguistic models of cognitive structure and abilities (see also chapter 11).
Second, cognitive linguists appeal at least in principle to models in cognitive psychology, in particular models of memory, perception, attention and categorization. Psychological models of memory have inspired linguistic models of the organization of linguistic knowledge into frames/domains (chapter 2), and grammatical knowledge in networks linked by taxonomic and other relations (see chapters 10–11 in Part III). Psychological models of attention and perception, especially Gestalt psychology, have led to the explication of many conceptualization processes in semantics (chapter 3, and see also the next paragraph). Finally, psychological models of categorization, in particular prototypes and graded centrality, and more recent models of category structure, have had perhaps the greatest inﬂuence on both semantic and grammatical category analysis in cognitive linguistics (chapter 3; see, e.g., Lakoff 1987, Taylor 1989[1997]).
The second major hypothesis of the cognitive linguistic approach is embodied in Langacker’s slogan ‘grammar is conceptualization.’ This slogan refers to a more speciﬁc hypothesis about conceptual structure, namely that conceptual structure cannot be reduced to a simple truth-conditional correspondence with the world. A major aspect of human cognitive ability is the conceptualization of the experience to be communicated (and also the conceptualization of the linguistic knowledge we possess). A major theme of the chapters in Part I of this book is that all aspects of conceptual structure are subject to construal, including the structure of categories (chapter 4) and the organization of knowledge (i.e., conceptual structures; chapter 2). In particular, it is argued that grammatical inﬂections and grammatical constructions play a major role in construing the experience to be communicated in speciﬁc ways (chapter 3). Part II of this book also explores and defends the conceptualization hypothesis for a wide range of lexical semantic phenomena, including topics widely discussed in cognitive linguistics (polysemy and metaphor) and lexical semantic topics that have not generally been examined by cognitive linguists (namely lexical relations such as antonymy, meronomy and hyponymy).
The third major hypothesis of the cognitive linguistic approach is that knowledge of language emerges from language use. That is, categories and structures

Introduction

in semantics, syntax, morphology and phonology are built up from our cognition of speciﬁc utterances on speciﬁc occasions of use. This inductive process of abstraction and schematization does not lose the conventionalized subtleties and differences found among even highly speciﬁc grammatical constructions and word meanings.
As we noted above, this hypothesis is a response to approaches to syntax and semantics in which highly general and abstract schemas and categories, sometimes claimed to be innately given, are assumed to govern the organization of linguistic knowledge, and apparently idiosyncratic or anomalous patterns are relegated to the periphery. Instead, cognitive linguists argue that the detailed analysis of subtle variations in syntactic behavior and semantic interpretation give rise to a different model of grammatical representation that accommodates idiosyncratic as well as highly general patterns of linguistic behavior (see, e.g., the arguments in chapter 9). In semantics, this model is manifested in Fillmore’s semantics of understanding (chapter 2), and Cruse’s dynamic construal approach to categorization (chapter 4 and Part II; see also Croft 2000:99–114). In syntax, this hypothesis has given rise directly to construction grammar as a new theory of syntax, and the usage-based model, developed in greatest detail for morphology and phonology. These models of syntax and morphology are described in Part III of this book.

PART I
A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis

Frames, domains, spaces: the organization of conceptual structure
2.1 Arguments for frame semantics
What is it that words denote, or symbolize as cognitive linguists usually put it? A simple assumption that has guided much research in semantics is that words denote concepts, units of meaning. Concepts symbolized by words such as stallion and mare can be compared and contrasted with one another. Comparisons of words is the approach taken by structural semantics, which analyzes types of semantic relations among words, including hyponymy and antonymy. Some approaches to (lexical) semantics have proposed that word concepts such as STALLION and MARE1 are not atomic. Many concepts can be broken down into semantic features, so that STALLION is [EQUINE, MALE], and MARE is [EQUINE, FEMALE]. Finally, in the logical tradition that underlies much work in semantics, concepts are ultimately deﬁned by their truth conditions: the conditions under which one can say that a concept does, or does not, appropriately apply to a situation in the world.
In this widespread approach to semantics, it is recognized that concepts do not simply ﬂoat around randomly in the mind. First, there are the relations between words and their corresponding concepts described by structural semantics. But there has been a strong feeling that concepts are organized in another way as well. Certain concepts ‘belong together’ because they are associated in experience. To use a classic example (Schank and Abelson 1977), a RESTAURANT is not merely a service institution; it has associated with it a number of concepts such as CUSTOMER, WAITER, ORDERING, EATING, BILL. These concepts are not related to RESTAURANT by hyponymy, meronymy, antonymy or other structural semantic relations; they are related to RESTAURANT by ordinary human experience. The concept of RESTAURANT is closely tied to the other concepts, and cannot be isolated from the other concepts.
1 We follow the practice of Fillmore (1982a) and Langacker (1987) in using lower-case italics to represent the word form, and capitals to represent the concept underlying the word meaning.

A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis

The need for another means for organizing concepts has been felt by researchers in cognitive psychology and artiﬁcial intelligence as well as in various branches of linguistics, and has led to a variety of similar proposals, each typically with its own name. Among these names are: frame, schema, script, global pattern, pseudotext, cognitive model, experiential gestalt, base, scene (Fillmore 1985:223, n. 4). The most inﬂuential version of this proposal in cognitive linguistics has been the model of frame semantics developed by Fillmore. We present Fillmore’s theory and arguments in this section, and turn to extensions of Fillmore’s ideas by other cognitive linguists in later sections.2
Fillmore views frames not as an additional means for organizing concepts, but as a fundamental rethinking of the goals of linguistic semantics. Fillmore describes his frame semantic model as a model of the semantics of understanding, in contrast to a truth-conditional semantics: the full, rich understanding that a speaker intends to convey in a text and that a hearer constructs for that text. Fillmore argues that in the analysis of linguistic meaning, understanding is the primary data; truth-value judgments and judgments of semantic relations such as synonymy and implication are derivative and theory-driven (Fillmore 1985:235). Fillmore’s frame semantics brings linguistic semantics back to that primary data and does not exclude any of it from consideration.
Fillmore uses a tool metaphor to describe the understanding process (Fillmore 1982a:112): a speaker produces words and constructions in a text as tools for a particular activity, namely to evoke a particular understanding; the hearer’s task is to ﬁgure out the activity those tools were intended for, namely to invoke that understanding. That is, words and constructions evoke an understanding, or more speciﬁcally a frame; a hearer invokes a frame upon hearing an utterance in order to understand it.
Fillmore uses a wide range of examples to demonstrate that there are signiﬁcant phenomena in linguistic semantics that cannot easily be captured in a model of structural semantics, semantic features and/or truth-conditional semantics. We survey his arguments here.
The analysis of semantic features is often justiﬁed on the basis of lexical sets that appear to be analyzable in terms of a simple set of features. For example, the lexical set in (1) can be analyzed in terms of the features [MALE/FEMALE], [ADULT/YOUNG], and [UNMARRIED]:

(1)

[MALE]

[FEMALE]

MAN

WOMAN [ADULT]

BOY

GIRL

[YOUNG]

BACHELOR SPINSTER [UNMARRIED]

2 The basic sources for Fillmore’s ideas are Fillmore 1975, 1977 (an expanded version of the ﬁrst paper), 1982a, 1985, 1986. Unfortunately all of these are difﬁcult to access.

Frames, domains, spaces

Yet our understanding of these concepts is more complex than this paradigm of feature constrasts implies. The relation between man/boy and woman/girl is not the same: for many people, the term girl is used for female humans at a signiﬁcantly higher age than the term boy is used for male humans (Fillmore 1982a:126). Moreover, the attitudes towards the sexes that this linguistic behavior is assumed to evoke has led to changes in the relationship and hypercorrection such that the term woman is attested as being applied even to an eight-year-old girl (ibid., 127). In a frame semantic analysis, man, boy, woman and girl evoke frames that include not just the biological sexual distinction but also differences in attitudes and behavior towards the sexes that would explain the traditional asymmetry in the use of boy/girl and the more recent change in the use of woman, including its hypercorrective use. Likewise, the difference between our understanding of bachelor and our understanding of spinster involves much more than a simple feature [MALE/FEMALE] (ibid., 131).
Many lexical contrasts contain semantic asymmetries that cannot be captured by features (except in an ad hoc fashion), but lend themselves easily to a frame semantic account. For example, the opposing terms used for the vertical extent of an erect human being are tall and short, for vertical distance from a bottom baseline (e.g. a branch of a tree) they are high and low, but for the vertical dimension of a building they are tall and low (Fillmore 1977a:71). It would be difﬁcult if not impossible to come up with a unitary feature deﬁnition of tall that captured its different contexts of use from high, and did the same for short vs. low. Instead, one can simply describe the frames for humans, buildings and other objects, and specify which words are used for vertical extent or distance in that frame.
Similarly, no simple unitary deﬁnitions would capture the contrast between the adjectives live and alive given in (2)–(4) (Fillmore 1977a:76–77):

(2)

a. Those are live lobsters.

b. Those lobsters are alive.

(3)

a. Her manner is very alive.

b. She has a very alive manner.

(4)

a. His performance was live.

b. He gave a live performance.

Moreover, one cannot deﬁne the features in terms of applicability to a semantic class, such that the sense illustrated in (2a–b) applies to living things; this would give an incorrect understanding to the theatre advertizing live naked girls than the one intended (presumably, as opposed to naked girls on a ﬁlm screen, not dead naked girls; ibid.). In a frame semantic analysis, live and alive are simply associated in different ways to three different frames: life in (2), personality in (3), and mode of performance in (4). In other cases, there are outright lexical splits, such as brother/brothers and brother/brethren, which represent a split in frames

10 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
including different plural forms; a unitary deﬁnition of brother would miss the frame contrast (ibid., 76).
Fillmore notes that his frame semantic model shares signiﬁcant properties with lexical (semantic) ﬁeld theory (Fillmore 1985:225–26; 1992:76–77). Lexical ﬁeld theory groups together words that are associated in experience, not unlike frame semantics. However, lexical ﬁeld theory differs from frame semantics in that words are deﬁned relative to other words in the same lexical ﬁeld, whereas in frame semantics, words are deﬁned directly with respect to the frame. For example, in lexical ﬁeld theory, one would observe that large in the ﬁeld of sizes of packages of soapﬂakes is in contrast with jumbo, economy giant and family size and hence describes the smallest size in the ﬁeld, unlike uses of large in other lexical ﬁelds (Fillmore 1985:227).
In frame semantics, the same observation can easily be captured: large labels the smallest size in the SOAPFLAKES frame. But lexical ﬁeld theory predicts that the meaning of a word in a ﬁeld can only be deﬁned in contrast to neighboring words in the ﬁeld. Lexical ﬁeld theory has difﬁculties if there are no neighboring words, or a speaker does not know the neighboring words: it predicts that the term has a different meaning. Fillmore notes that while German has a word for the sides of a right angle triangle other than the Hypotenuse, namely Kathete, most English speakers do not have such a word (ibid., 228–29). Yet the understanding of English hypotenuse and German Hypotenuse is the same, provided the speaker understands what a right angle triangle is. This is not a problem in frame semantics, where the word concept is linked directly to the frame, in this case the RIGHT ANGLE TRIANGLE frame.
Another argument in favor of a frame-based approach to lexical semantics are words whose corresponding concepts inherently refer to other concepts extrinsic to the concept denoted by the word. Some word concepts refer to a prior history of the entity denoted. A scar is not just a feature of the surface of someone’s skin, but the healing state of a wound; a widow is a woman who was once married but whose husband has died (Fillmore 1977a:73). Other word concepts, especially for properties and actions, cannot be understood without understanding something about the participant in the action or possessor of the properties: one cannot understand gallop without knowing about the body of a horse, or hungry without understanding the physiology of living things (ibid., 73–74). This is true of object concepts as well: lap cannot be understood except in reference to a person’s posture and the function of one’s lap in supporting another object (ibid.).
Another clear class of examples that requires reference to extrinsic entities are deictic expressions that evoke the speech act situation (Fillmore 1982a:117). For example, the past tense situates an event in a point or interval or time relative to the speech act situation. The speech act situation, including its time of occurrence,

Frames, domains, spaces 11
functions as the frame against which past time reference is proﬁled. Likewise, all other deictic words and inﬂections, such as person deixis (I, you, he/she/it, we, they and person-based agreement inﬂections) and spatial deixis (this, that, here, there), evoke the speech act situation. Other types of grammatical words and inﬂections also have meanings evoking the speech act situation. For example, the deﬁnite articles the and a deﬁne the identity of the noun referent relative to the mutual knowledge of speaker and hearer (the basically indicates mutually known, a not mutually known, in most contexts). The meanings of the and a evoke the speech act situation because they make reference to the mental states of speaker and hearer (see also §3.4).
Above all, many word concepts cannot be understood apart from the intentions of the participants or the social and cultural institutions and behavior in which the action, state or thing is situated. For example, the concept VEGETARIAN only makes sense in the frame of a culture in which meat-eating is common; the concepts STRIKE or BORROW can only be understood in the frame of a culture in which such actions occur (Fillmore 1982a:120). Even something as simple as an apple core evokes a frame describing a particular way of eating apples: ‘an apple-core is that part of the apple that somebody who eats apples the way most of us do has left uneaten’ (Fillmore 1977a:73).
Another respect in which a word meaning makes reference to extrinsic entities is that a word allows the speaker and hearer to focus their attention on only part of an entire frame; no one word gives the full structure of the frame. The classic example is the commercial transaction frame (Fillmore 1977a:58–59; 1977b); but a much clearer case is the RISK frame (Fillmore and Atkins 1992). Fillmore and Atkins identify the following elements of the RISK frame: Chance (uncertainty about the future), Harm, Victim (of the Harm), Valued Object (potentially endangered by the risk), Situation (which gives rise to the risk), Deed (that brings about the Situation), Actor (of the Deed), (Intended) Gain (by the Actor in taking a risk), Purpose (of the Actor in the Deed), Beneﬁciary and Motivation (for the Actor). The verb risk occurs in many syntactic constructions, some of which are exempliﬁed in (5a–e), but none of them include all or even most of the elements of the RISK frame (Fillmore & Atkins 1992: 83, 87, 89, 94, 96; all but the ﬁrst are corpus examples):

(5)

a. You’ve (Actor/Victim) risked your health (Valued Object) for a few cheap thrills

(Gain).

b. Others (Actor/Victim) had risked all (Valued Object) in the war (Situation).

c. She (Actor/Victim) had risked so much (Valued Object) for the sake of vanity

(Motivation).

d. Men (Actor/Victim) were not inclined to risk scalping (Harm) for the sake of

settlers they had never seen (Beneﬁciary).

e. I (Actor/Victim) didn’t dare risk a pause (Deed) to let that sink in (Purpose).

12 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis

In a frame semantic analysis, any of the uses of risk evokes the entire RISK frame, even if only part of that frame is overtly focused on by the construction in which risk is used.
The semantics of understanding also allows Fillmore to account for linguistic facts that do not lend themselves to a truth-functional analysis. For example, the collocations in (6) could be reversed as in (7) without producing semantic anomaly (Fillmore 1977a:75–76):

(6)

a. A dog was barking.

b. A hound was baying.

(7)

a. A dog was baying.

b. A hound was barking.

In other words, the difference between (6) and (7) cannot be accounted for by semantic constraints. But the examples in (6a–b) sound much more natural because the noun and the verb in each sentence both evoke the same frame.
Likewise, a truth-conditional semantics cannot capture many aspects of our understanding of (8) (Fillmore 1985:230–31):

(8)

My dad wasted most of the morning on the bus.

Fillmore notes that choosing father or dad (without the possessive) would express a different relationship between the speaker and the speaker’s father; the morning is understood to be deﬁned against the frame of the working day (i.e, around 8am to noon) rather than the calendar day (midnight to noon); waste frames the use of time very differently from spend; and on the bus frames the speaker’s location in terms of the bus being in service, rather than simply a physical container (which would be evoked by in the bus).
A truth-conditional model also cannot account for the anomaly of frames that are appropriate at one time of utterance but not at another because the world has changed in the meantime. Fillmore uses the contrived example in (9), noting that it could be said in 1984 but not in, say, 1919 (Fillmore 1985:238–39):

(9)

During World War I, Ronald Reagan’s birth mother dropped his analog watch

into the sound hole of the acoustic guitar.

Such a sentence could be uttered in 1984, because World War II had occurred, allowing the 1914–18 war to be renamed World War I; medical technology had allowed the dissociation of the birth mother from the genetic mother (who donates the egg); and electric guitars and digital watches had been invented. None of these framings of the objects, persons or events was available in 1919, and so (9) would be an impossible utterance at that time, even if true retrospectively.
Finally, frame semantics offers a natural account of a number of problematic phenomena that seem to be caught between semantics and pragmatics, including

Frames, domains, spaces 13
the nature of text coherence. A large class of presuppositional phenomena appear to be tied to speciﬁc words, such as regret in (10) (Fillmore 1985:249):
(10) John regretted signing the letter.
Example (10) denotes (or entails) a particular mental state of John, namely his feeling of regret, but (in one analysis) is said to presuppose that John did sign the letter. The problem for truth-conditional semantics is that if John did not sign the letter, (9) has no truth conditions. In order to preserve truth conditions one may shunt the presupposition problem off to pragmatics. This seems odd since the presupposition is associated with a particular word and its meaning, which is semantic. But presuppositions display a further type of peculiar behavior, in negative sentences such as (11):
(11) John didn’t regret signing the letter.
In one interpretation, the entailment is negated – John does not have any regrets – but the presupposition is not – John signed the letter. However, there is another interpretation of (11), namely that John did not regret signing the letter because he did not sign it (Fillmore 1985:251).
Fillmore argues that the behavior of presuppositions can be easily accounted for in a frame semantic analysis. The concept REGRET includes in its frame the accomplishment of an action towards which the regretter has his/her regrets. If the action is absent from the frame, understanding of the positive sentence fails. Negation, on the other hand, can negate either the concept denoted or the frame itself. Negating the state of affairs in the frame preserves the rest of the frame, including the action that could have led to the regrets. This is the ﬁrst interpretation of (11) described above. Negating the entire frame, on the other hand, also negates the action that could have led to the regrets. This is the second interpretation of (11): the speaker denies the framing of the situation as including the action of John having signed the letter.
We may compare (11) to other examples of frame negation, such as the one in (12) (Fillmore 1985:245, from Wilson 1975:138):
(12) You didn’t spare me a day at the seaside: you deprived me of one.
In (12), the speaker denies the positively evaluated framing of the action as sparing her, and replaces it with the negatively evaluated framing of depriving her.
Finally, the semantics of understanding plays a major role in text understanding. For example, the well-known example of initial deﬁnite reference, e.g. the carburetor in (13) (described as ‘bridging’ by Clark and Haviland [1977] and ‘evoked’ by Prince [1981a]), are in fact due to the frame evoked by the ﬁrst sentence (Fillmore 1977a:75):

14 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
(13) I had trouble with the car yesterday. The carburetor was dirty.
The car in the ﬁrst sentence evokes a frame that allows the hearer to identify which carburetor of the millions in the world the speaker was referring to. But frame semantics contributes more than the resolution of deﬁnite reference to the analysis of the coherence of texts. Fillmore contrasts (13) with (14) (ibid.):
(14) I had trouble with the car yesterday. The ashtray was dirty.
The second sentence in (14) is incoherent with the ﬁrst, even though the deﬁnite reference can be resolved (most cars have ashtrays). The reason for this is that there is nothing evoked in the frame of having trouble with the car that has anything to do with the ashtray – unlike (13), because dirty carburetors do cause problems for cars.
Fillmore’s arguments present a wide range of data that justify the introduction of frames to the analysis of linguistic semantics, and the replacement of a truthconditional semantics with a semantics of understanding. In the following sections, we lay out more systematically the frame semantic model and follow its further development in cognitive linguistics.
2.2 Concepts: proﬁle-frame organization
In the preceding section, we described the frame as a coherent region of human knowledge, or as a coherent region of conceptual space. The question immediately arises: How does one identify a coherent region of conceptual space, differentiating it from other regions? An a priori approach to this question, using one’s own intuitions to identify frames, would be highly subjective. A more empirical approach to this question is to identify frames based on the words and constructions of a human language such as English. This approach is taken by Langacker (1987), which we will use as our starting point.
Langacker illustrates his approach to the problem with the meaning of the word radius. The word form radius symbolizes (denotes) the concept RADIUS. We begin here by assuming that concepts correspond to meanings of linguistic units (words, complex expressions or constructions). One may also assume that concepts exist that do not correspond to linguistic meanings. However, one would have the same problems trying to identify concepts independent of linguistic meanings as trying to identify frames independent of linguistic meanings, namely the lack of an empirical basis for doing so. For this reason, we will restrict ourselves to concepts corresponding to actual linguistic meanings in this chapter.
The ﬁrst sense for radius in the American Heritage Dictionary is ‘a line segment that joins the center of a circle with any point on its circumference.’ A RADIUS is

Frames, domains, spaces 15
a line segment, but not any line segment: the line segment is deﬁned relative to the structure of the circle. In other words, one can understand RADIUS only against a background understanding of the concept CIRCLE, which can be geometrically illustrated as in Figure 2.1.
RADIUS
CIRCLE Figure 2.1 RADIUS and CIRCLE
In other words, the concepts RADIUS and CIRCLE are intimately related, and this relationship must be represented in conceptual structure. Langacker describes the relationship between RADIUS and CIRCLE as one of a concept proﬁle against a base. The proﬁle refers to the concept symbolized by the word in question. The base is that knowledge or conceptual structure that is presupposed by the proﬁled concept. Langacker also uses the term domain for the base (this term is also used in Lakoff 1987). This is identical to Fillmore’s frame (§2.1): ‘by the term “frame” I have in mind any system of concepts related in such a way that to understand any one of them you have to understand the whole structure in which it ﬁts’ (Fillmore 1982a:111). The term ‘proﬁle’ has also come to be used as a verb to describe the relationship between word form and word meaning (proﬁle+base): e.g. radius proﬁles a particular line segment in the CIRCLE base/domain/frame.
A concept proﬁle is insufﬁcient to deﬁne a word concept, because it presupposes other knowledge in its deﬁnition, namely its base. But a single base, such as CIRCLE, is a complex conceptual structure that includes a wide range of concept proﬁles, such as RADIUS, ARC, CENTER, DIAMETER, CHORD and so on. Hence the base alone is insufﬁcient to deﬁne a linguistic concept either. The conclusion that follows from this is that the meaning of a l inguistic unit must specify both the profile and its b ase. This is identical to Fillmore’s conclusion regarding concept frames.
The fact that a base supports multiple concept proﬁles is what makes the base a domain, in the intuitive sense: several different concept proﬁles have it as a base. We can now deﬁne a domain as a semantic structure that functions as the base for at least one concept profile (typically, many proﬁles). As Taylor (1989[1997]:84) notes, ‘In principle, any conceptualization or knowledge conﬁguration, no matter how simple or complex, can serve as the

16 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
cognitive domain for the characterization of meanings.’ We may now say that the domain CIRCLE includes the concepts of an arc, a diameter, a radius, a chord and so on.
The canonical example of a proﬁle-base relation is the part-whole relation: all agree that a concept such as ARM cannot be deﬁned without reference to BODY. A similar class of concepts are kin terms such as daughter. The concept DAUGHTER presupposes the concept PARENT, and the particular type of kin relationship that holds between them. The concept NIECE presupposes other kinship concepts, and more complex kin relationships. In other words, the base against which a proﬁle is deﬁned can be more complex than just the whole of which some entity is a part. In some cases, one cannot always ﬁnd a single simple word to describe the base: for NIECE, perhaps the best description of the base is KINSHIP SYSTEM, or some part of that system (see §2.4).
But it is not only relational nouns that represent a concept proﬁle against a base, as we saw in §2.1. Consider another example, the word weekend (Fillmore 1985:223–24). The concept WEEKEND can only be understood against a whole background system of the calendrical cycle, deﬁned partly by natural phenomena (the sequence of day and night) and cultural conventions (the seven-day week cycle, and its division into working days and nonworking days). Likewise, the concept BUY can only be understood against a background knowledge of the commercial transaction situation. Different aspects of the commercial transaction are proﬁled by BUY, SELL, PAY, COST and so forth. Such domains/frames cannot be readily represented in a geometric form in the way that RADIUS and CIRCLE are represented in Figure 2.1, although schematic diagrams are often resorted to in cognitive linguistics in order to represent the complex interconnectedness of concepts in domains or frames.
In fact, no concept exists autonomously: all are understood to ﬁt into our general knowledge of the world in one way or another. What matters for semantic analysis is the proﬁle-base relation, and the relationships between bases and domains. Some of the corollaries of this analysis of word meaning into proﬁle and base/frame/domain will be explored in the following section.
2.3 Some consequences of the proﬁle-frame/domain distinction
The terms frame (Fillmore), base (Langacker) and domain (Fillmore, Lakoff, Langacker) all appear to identify the same theoretical framework, as described in the preceding sections. Fillmore describes this framework as frame semantics, and this term has entered into more general usage among cognitive

Frames, domains, spaces 17
linguists. However, the terms frame and domain continue to compete for usage, and base is also used among cognitive grammarians. We will use the terms frame and domain interchangeably here. Nevertheless, there are still other terms that have been proposed to describe types of semantic analyses that bear a strong afﬁnity to frame semantics. We mention three inﬂuential theories here, which originated in artiﬁcial intelligence (scripts), cognitive psychology (the ‘theory theory’) and sociology (communities).
The examples of frames given above appear to be largely static in character. But this is not necessary: a frame is any coherent body of knowledge presupposed by a word concept. In particular, frames can include dynamic concepts, that is, extending through time. For example, PURIFIED presupposes in its frame a prior impure state of the entity which is then changed by some process; in contrast, PURE does not presuppose anything about prior states and processes. Of course, process terms such as RUN or BUY presuppose a sequence of events and prior and posterior states. The term script is often used for a frame/domain with a sequence of events, following Schank and Abelson (1977). They use the term to describe a canonical sequence of events presupposed by a social activity such as going to a restaurant. We subsume scripts under frames/domains.
Another theoretical construct that can be understood as a type of frame or domain is the so-called ‘theory theory’ of categorization found in cognitive psychology. Advocates of the theory theory argue that our understanding of categories such as HORSE or HAMMER is based not on perceptual features but on theories of biological kinds and artifacts respectively (Murphy and Medin 1985). For instance, we have at least a folk theory of biological kinds that indicates that individuals of the same category (e.g. HORSE) are members of that category by virtue of descent and reproduction, and perceptual similarity of horses (and the distinctness of individuals of other species) are a result of those basic biological patterns. Likewise, hammers are deﬁned by the fact that they are manufactured by human beings for a particular function, and perceptual similarity of hammers (and the distinctness of other kinds of artifacts) are a result of their intended function. In frame semantic terms, the base for HORSE includes the ‘theory’ of biological kinds and the base for HAMMER includes the ‘theory’ of artifacts (see Fillmore 1986a:54).
Fillmore also uses the notion of framing to describe differences in the community or social domain of use of a word (Fillmore 1982a:127–29). For example, he notes that in the legal domain, that is, the community that engages in legal activity, the concepts of MURDER and INNOCENT differ from those concepts used outside that domain/community. In the legal domain, MURDER is proﬁled in a frame/domain where it contrasts with MANSLAUGHTER, but outside that domain, MURDER is proﬁled in a domain lacking that contrast. In the legal

18 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
domain, INNOCENCE is proﬁled against a frame in which innocence and guilt are the result of judgements in a trial (and in fact, guilt can be established only after the completion of the trial). Outside that domain, INNOCENT is proﬁled against a frame in which innocence and guilt are deﬁned by whether the person in question committed the crime or not. Other concepts such as FLIP STRENGTH exist only in a specialized community, in this case publishers of pornography (the interested reader may turn to Fillmore 1982a:12 for further details). Hence, frame semantics is being extended to describe differences that appear to be deﬁned on social rather than conceptual grounds. But there is a link between the two. Communities are deﬁned by the social activities that bind the members together. Clark argues that communities involve the possession of shared expertise among their members: the specialized knowledge that is acquired by engaging in the activities that deﬁne the community (Clark 1996:102–4). This shared expertise is the conceptual structure that is found in the frame/domains of the concepts symbolized by the specialized vocabulary used by members of the community.
The distinction between proﬁle and frame/domain is a useful tool for analyzing a number of interesting semantic questions. In particular, some distinctions in word meaning apply not to the proﬁled concept – what is usually thought of as ‘the deﬁnition’ of a word – but to its frame/domain.
For example, some concepts appear to denote the same thing in the world but proﬁle it against a different frame. For example, LAND and GROUND denote (proﬁle) what seems to be the ‘same thing,’ but against different frames: LAND describes the dry surface of the earth in contrast with SEA, while GROUND describes the dry surface of the earth in contrast with AIR (Fillmore 1982a:121). The frame chosen by one word or another allows one to make different inferences: Fillmore notes that a bird that spends its life on land does not go in the water, but a bird that spends its life on the ground does not ﬂy (ibid.). Langacker offers the example of ROE and CAVIAR, both being ﬁsh eggs: ROE is proﬁled against the frame/domain of the reproductive cycle of ﬁsh, while CAVIAR is proﬁled against the frame/domain of food preparation/consumption (Langacker 1987:164–65). Another example is FLESH, proﬁled against the frame/domain of the body’s anatomy, vs. MEAT, proﬁled against the frame/domain of food. The semantic difference is reﬂected in the collocations ﬂesh and bones, describing an emaciated body, and meat and potatoes, describing a bland but ﬁlling type of meal (contrast meat and bones and ﬂesh and potatoes).
The alternative framing of the same proﬁle is particularly common with terms that are evaluative in character. For example, STINGY proﬁles one end of a scale, the opposite of which is GENEROUS; while THRIFTY appears to proﬁle the same end of the same scale, and its opposite end is proﬁled by WASTEFUL (Fillmore 1982a:125). The difference is the orientation of the associated evaluative

Frames, domains, spaces 19
scale: the evaluation of STINGY-GENEROUS is the inverse of that for THRIFTYWASTEFUL. Of course, a speaker may choose to frame someone as either STINGY or THRIFTY. In other words, how an experience is framed is a matter of construal: it depends on how the speaker conceptualizes the experience to be communicated, for the understanding of the hearer. This is only one example of the construals that pervade human conceptualization of experience (see chapter 3).
Another type of evaluative framing effect is more indirect, as in the example FETUS vs. UNBORN BABY, terms used by opposing sides of the debate on abortion. FETUS proﬁles the entity in question against a more general MAMMAL frame: any mammal’s unborn progeny may be called a fetus. This frame makes abortion appear less morally repugnant, since it is widely accepted in society that animals can be killed for certain purposes. The complex phrase UNBORN BABY exploits two frames. BABY proﬁles the same entity against the more speciﬁc HUMAN frame: we prototypically use baby only for human offspring. Both BABY and UNBORN proﬁle the entity against its projected later lifestage, namely after birth. These frames make abortion appear more repugnant, since killing humans is accepted only under quite restricted circumstances (e.g. war and self-defense), and all agree that once a fetus is born, it is a human being. The difference in framing the entity denoted by fetus or unborn baby therefore orientates (or biases, to frame it differently!) the hearer towards the political stance on abortion adopted by the speaker.
The above examples all illustrate different words that proﬁle the same concept but in subtly different frames. There are also examples where a single word is usually analyzed as polysemous – having distinct albeit related meanings – but where those meaning differences are more due to differences in frame rather than differences in proﬁle. For example, a word such as mouth describes roughly the same concept proﬁle but with different frames:
(15) mouth: BODY, BOTTLE, CAVE, RIVER
In the examples of frames for mouth in (15), mouth can be thought of as denoting the same type of proﬁle, namely the opening to a container (however, a cave may have several openings to the earth’s surface, and the container of a river is deﬁned by both the riverbed and gravity). The word mouth is generally considered to be polysemous, that is, it has a sense for each of the proﬁle-base pairings (senses that may not share the same word in other languages). In other words, the proﬁle alone is insufﬁcient in deﬁning the senses of mouth.
The proﬁle-frame/domain distinction is particularly useful in understanding the nature of semantic differences between words and their apparent translation equivalents in different languages. The proﬁle-frame/domain distinction may shed light on some aspects of why translation is difﬁcult and often unsuccessful.

20 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
One can ﬁnd frame-based semantic contrasts across languages that are similar to those found within a single language such as LAND/GROUND. Fillmore contrasts the English word concept LUKEWARM with the Japanese word concept NURUI. Both concepts proﬁle the state ‘at room temperature,’ but for English speakers LUKEWARM is used for liquids that are ideally hot or ideally cold, whereas for some Japanese speakers NURUI is used only for liquids that are ideally hot (Fillmore 1982a:121).
Sometimes linguistic differences across languages represent differences in how much information is speciﬁed in the frame, rather than something about the inherent structure of the proﬁled concept. English river proﬁles a more or less permanent ﬂow of water in a natural channel, presupposing a frame specifying the relevant topographical features. French contrasts rivie`re and ﬂeuve. The concepts for both French words is essentially the same as the concept for the English word – a natural ﬂowing waterway – but the frame is more speciﬁc than the English frame for each word: ﬂeuve speciﬁes in addition that it is a major waterway that ﬂows into the sea, unlike rivie`re. Hence a translation of ﬂeuve as river is partly accurate (the proﬁle), but not completely so (its frame). Another example is English eat, which proﬁles the process of consuming food. German contrasts essen and fressen: both describe the process of consuming food also, but the former speciﬁes that the eater is human and the latter that the eater is an animal (nonhuman). This is a framing effect and is therefore subject to construal (§3.3). That is, one can use the term fressen to describe the action of a human being, but it frames that action much differently than essen, leading to a construal of the action as being animal-like (crude, sloppy, etc.).
The nature of word meaning across languages is sometimes obscured by analysts who do not distinguish between proﬁle and frame in their word deﬁnitions. For example, some languages are described as having words that correspond to whole sentences in English. Two candidate examples are given in (16)–(17), the ﬁrst from a native American language and the second from a European language:
(16) Alabama ispaspaaka´hmit ‘to be shaped into a patty, shaped like a biscuit (said of the shape of the mixture of brains and moss used for curing hides)’ (Sylestine et al. 1993:203)
(17) Swedish tura – ‘sitting on the boat going back and forth between Helsingborg and Helsingør’ (Karina Vamling, pers. comm.)
By distinguishing proﬁle from frame/domain, we may give a more straightforward semantic analysis. The concepts proﬁled are pretty simple: ispaspaaka´hmit proﬁles a shape and tura proﬁles sitting. But the frames in which the concepts are situated are very speciﬁc (in [17], staying on the boat means paying only one fare

Frames, domains, spaces 21
and drinking duty-free alcohol). A similar English example would be genuﬂect. Genuﬂect proﬁles more or less the same concept as kneel, a bodily movement – but in a highly speciﬁc frame, namely Catholic religious practice. But even less culturally speciﬁc word concepts can be fruitfully divided into proﬁle and frame. A radius proﬁles a line segment; the difference between radius and line segment is found in their frames.
The proﬁle-frame distinction also allows for a natural analysis of words in languages that have been described as ‘untranslatable’ in a more profound way than the examples of ﬂeuve or fressen given above. For example, Geertz gives a lengthy explication of Javanese rasa, part of which is quoted below:
Rasa has two primary meanings: ‘feeling’ and ‘meaning’. As ‘feeling’ it is one of the traditional Javanese ﬁve senses – seeing, hearing, talking, smelling and feeling, and it includes within itself three aspects of ‘feeling’ that our view of the ﬁve senses separates: taste on the tongue, touch on the body, and emotional ‘feeling’ within the ‘heart’, like sadness and happiness. The taste of a banana is its rasa; a hunch is a rasa; a pain is a rasa; and so is a passion. As ‘meaning’, rasa is applied to words in a letter, in a poem, or even in common speech to indicate the between-the-lines type of indirection and allusive suggestion that is so important in Javanese communication and social intercourse. And it is given the same application to behavioral acts generally: to indicate the implicit import, the connotative ‘feeling’ of dance movements, polite gestures, and so forth. But in this second, semantic sense, it also means ‘ultimate signiﬁcance’ – the deepest meaning at which one arrives by dint of mystical effort and whose clariﬁcation resolves all the ambiguities of mundane existence [etc.]. (Geertz 1973: 134–35)
Basically, understanding the meaning of rasa presupposes understanding large portions of Javanese culture and worldview. In frame semantic terms, the concept RASA presupposes a frame consisting of much of Javanese culture. Examples of this type can also be found closer to home. For example, a translator dealing with a twentieth-century German philosophical work, writes about the term Bildung: ‘Bildung is translated by “culture” and related forms such as “cultivation”, “cultivated” . . . The term has the ﬂavor of the late-eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and played a key role throughout German-speaking Europe’ (Gadamer 1989:xii). That is, BILDUNG is proﬁled against a frame of the culture of the German intellectual elite stretching back almost two centuries.
In other words, the reason that words such as rasa and Bildung are ‘untranslatable’ is because of the culture-speciﬁc character of the frame/base against which the concept is proﬁled. Translating rasa as feeling or meaning, or Bildung as culture, approximates the proﬁle of the concept but does not have the same frame at all.

2.4 Extensions of the basic proﬁle-frame/domain distinction
The distinction between proﬁle and domain/frame is a fundamental one in the theory of semantics used in cognitive linguistics. It has nevertheless proved to be insufﬁcient in itself to capture a number of important semantic phenomena, and the basic theory has been elaborated in several directions.
2.4.1 Locational and conﬁgurational proﬁles
One extension of the frame semantic model recognizes two different kinds of proﬁles. Consider again the SPACE domain. A concept like RECTANGLE is proﬁled in the SPACE domain. Note that an octagon is an octagon wherever it is located in space. What matters for the proﬁle of RECTANGLE is simply the number and conﬁguration of line segments forming the sides. The proﬁle for RECTANGLE contrasts with the proﬁle of a spatial concept such as HERE. HERE proﬁles a location in SPACE, one that is deﬁned with respect to the position of the speaker. You cannot move the proﬁled location without changing the concept. The same constraint applies to a concept like MOUNT TAMALPAIS. This concept also proﬁles a location in SPACE; another mountain in another location is not, nor ever will be, MOUNT TAMALPAIS (in contrast to MOUNTAIN, which is a topographical conﬁguration that can be located anywhere). These are two different kinds of proﬁles: RECTANGLE has a conﬁgurational proﬁle and HERE or MOUNT TAMALPAIS has a locational proﬁle (Langacker 1987:153; Clausner and Croft 1999:7–13).3
Not every frame/domain can support both kinds of proﬁles. Color words, for example, specify regions in the HUE scale; if one moves to a different location on the HUE scale, then the concept changes, for example from RED to YELLOW. But there is no conﬁgurational proﬁle on the HUE scale. This is not a fact about all one-dimensional scalar domains. For example, the domain of (musical) PITCH has both locational and conﬁgurational proﬁles. For example, particular notes such as C-SHARP, or more precisely one speciﬁc note such as C# (the C-sharp an augmented octave above middle C), proﬁles a single location on the pitch scale. However, a musical interval such as OCTAVE has a conﬁgurational proﬁle: an OCTAVE is an octave wherever it occurs as long as the pitch interval is correct (Clausner and Croft 1999:10). More generally, measurable one-dimensional scalar domains such as PITCH, LENGTH and so on allow for both locational and conﬁgurational
3 Langacker argues that the locational-conﬁgurational distinction applies to domains, but Clausner and Croft demonstrate that the same domain can support locational and conﬁgurational proﬁles.

Frames, domains, spaces 23
proﬁles. Antonymic adjectives such as TALL/SHORT (see chapter 7) proﬁle a particular location or direction on a scalar domain. Units of measurement on the scale, such as INCH or FOOT, proﬁle conﬁgurations: an inch is the same interval no matter the locations subsumed under the measured interval.

2.4.2 Scope of predication
In §2.2, we used the example of NIECE, demonstrating that its proper deﬁnition presupposes the system of kinship relations. But we do not need the entire kinship system in order to understand the concept NIECE. Only a small part of it is necessary as represented in Figure 2.2 (the gender-neutral square symbol is used because the intervening kin for NIECE may be male or female).

=

=

EGO

NIECE Figure 2.2 NIECE

The relevant part of the kinship system for deﬁning NIECE is called the scope of predication for the concept (Langacker 1987:118–19; renamed immediate scope [Langacker 1999:49]).
An example of different scopes of predication can be found in the behavior of human body parts such as the following parts of the arm (Langacker 1987:119): KNUCKLE ⊂ FINGER ⊂ HAND ⊂ ARM ⊂ BODY. Each one has its immediate successor as its scope of predication. Possessive constructions referring to wholes within the scope of predication are acceptable, but if the whole is beyond the scope of predication, then the sentence is odd (Langacker 1987:119; but see §6.2.1.7):
(18) a. A body has two arms. b. A hand has ﬁve ﬁngers. c. A ﬁnger has three knuckles and a ﬁngernail. d. ?An arm has ﬁve ﬁngers. e. ??A body has twenty-eight knuckles.

24 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
Nested scopes of predications can be generalized to nesting of frames/domains in general.
2.4.3 Relationships between domains
Much more complex is the elaboration of the relationships among domains – not surprisingly, since this touches on the organization of human knowledge in the mind.
An important fact about proﬁles and frames/domains is that one can have successive chains of proﬁle-frame relations. The concept RADIUS can only be understood in terms of CIRCLE, as noted above. But the concept CIRCLE can itself only be understood in terms of (two-dimensional) SPACE. That is, the word circle proﬁles CIRCLE against the SPACE frame. In other words, a concept that functions as the frame/domain for other concepts is itself a proﬁle for another conceptual frame/domain. In other words, whether a conceptual structure is the proﬁle or frame/domain is a matter of construal (see §§2.3, 3.2).
The chain of proﬁle-frame relations does eventually bottom out, when we reach directly embodied human experience. SPACE is a good candidate for a directly embodied human experience. Langacker calls domains rooted in directly embodied human experience basic domains (Langacker 1987:148); he calls nonbasic domains abstract domains. A major theme of Lakoff and Johnson’s cognitive linguistic research is that even our most abstract knowledge is ultimately grounded in directly embodied human experience (Lakoff and Johnson 1980, chapter 12; Johnson 1987; Lakoff and Johnson 1999). Other examples of basic domains besides SPACE are MATERIAL, TIME, FORCE and a host of perceptual and bodily sensations (COLOR, HARDNESS, LOUDNESS, HUNGER, PAIN etc.). There are also emotional and other mental states and processes, and also social properties, relations and processes, that do not presuppose other domains. Exactly which mental and social domains are basic depends on one’s theory of mind and social interaction, and so we will not make any speciﬁc proposals here.
The relation between an abstract domain and the basic domain it presupposes is not a taxonomic relation (or, as Langacker calls such relations, a schematic one). It is a relationship of concept to background assumption or presupposition. This distinction is sometimes obscured by the English language. For example, the word shape as a mass noun stands for the domain, but as a count noun (a shape) it is a more general or schematic concept subsuming [CIRCLE], [SQUARE], [TRIANGLE] and so on. A more general or schematic concept is not the domain for the particular concept; in fact, a schematic concept is itself proﬁled in the same domain as its instantiation. As will be seen below, it is not always easy to distinguish a taxonomic relation from a proﬁle-domain relation.

Frames, domains, spaces 25
Langacker argues that some domains involve more than one dimension (Langacker 1987:150–51). An obvious case is space, which involves three dimensions (some concepts such as CIRCLE need only two dimensions for their deﬁnition; others such as LINE need only one). Many physical qualities that are grounded in the experience of sensory perception, such as TEMPERATURE and PITCH, are one-dimensional. Others, such as COLOR, can be divided into HUE, BRIGHTNESS and SATURATION. Generally, dimensions of a domain are all simultaneously presupposed by concepts proﬁled in that domain. This is the critical point: a concept may presuppose several different dimensions at once.
In fact, a concept may presuppose (be proﬁled in) several different domains. For example, a human being must be deﬁned relative to the domains of physical objects, living things and volitional agents (and several other domains, e.g. emotion). The combination of domains simultaneously presupposed by a concept such as HUMAN BEING is called a domain matrix. Langacker makes the important point that there is in principle only a difference of degree between dimensions of a domain and domains in a matrix (Langacker 1987:152). In practice, we are more likely to call a semantic structure a domain if there are a substantial number of concepts proﬁled relative to that structure. If there are few if any concepts proﬁled relative to that structure alone, but instead there are concepts proﬁled relative to that structure and another one, then those structures are likely to be called two dimensions of a single domain. The term ‘domain’ implies a degree of cognitive independence not found in a dimension (see also §5.3.1).
The domain structure presupposed by a concept can be extremely complex. Let us now consider how one would deﬁne what seems to be a kind of physical object, the letter T. It is directly deﬁned as a letter of the alphabet; its base (domain) is hence the alphabet. The alphabet is itself an abstract domain presupposing the notion of a writing system – it is not just an instance of a writing system, since the latter involves not just a set of symbols such as an alphabet but also the means of putting them together, including the direction of letters on a page, spaces for words and so on. The domain of writing systems in turn presupposes the activity of writing. The activity of writing must be deﬁned in terms of human communication, which presupposes the notion of meaning – perhaps a basic domain, since the symbolic relation appears not to be reducible to some other relation – and visual sensations, since writing is communication via visually perceived inscriptions, rather than auditorily or through gestures. And since writing is an activity, the domains of time and force or causation (both basic domains; see §3.5) are also involved in the domain matrix of writing, since the letter T is the product of an activity. Since writing is a human activity, it presupposes the involvement of human beings. Human beings are living things with mental abilities, such as volition, intention, cognition and emotion (themselves dimensions of the mental domain or

26 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
better domains in the matrix of the domain of the mind). Living things in turn are physical objects endowed with life. Physical objects possess material existence and are spatial entities (although material objects always have spatial extent, spatial objects like geometric ﬁgures can exist without material embodiment).
A diagram exhibiting all of the basic-abstract domain relations presupposed in deﬁning the concept of the letter T is given in Figure 2.3 (based on Croft 1993[2002]:170, Fig. 2.1; the proﬁled concept is given in boldface, and the basic domains are given in capitals).

Figure 2.3 Domain structure underlying the concept of the letter T

From this, it can be seen that it is incorrect to describe the concept of the letter T simply as belonging to the domain of writing, as a typical informal theory of domains would most likely have it. The vast majority of concepts belong to abstract domains, which are themselves proﬁled in complex domain matrices, often also abstract and so ultimately presuppose a large array of basic domains that can be called a domain structure (Croft 1993[2002]:169; this corresponds to Langacker’s maximal scope [Langacker 1999:49]).
It is not easy to distinguish proﬁle-base relations from taxonomic/schematic relations (that is, type vs. instance). For example, is writing an instance of human communication, or is writing an instance of an activity that can only be understood

Frames, domains, spaces 27
in terms of the goals of human communication? Figure 2.3 assumes that the latter is a more accurate description. Likewise, since writing is an instance of human activity, human activity does not appear as its domain, but the various domains that it presupposes – time, change, force, volition – do appear, because anything presupposed by a human activity will be presupposed by any instance of it.
It is also difﬁcult to determine direct vs. indirect reference to a domain. The deﬁnition of an arc does not directly presuppose two-dimensional space, but rather it presupposes a circle which in turn presupposes two-dimensional space. Thus, an arc is not directly a two-dimensional object per se, but only such by virtue of being a part of a circle. Likewise, the letter T is not directly a shape, but only such by virtue of being a letter of the alphabet. But in fact, is the letter T a shape by virtue of being a letter of the alphabet, or by virtue of being the physical product of the activity of writing? Figure 2.3 assumes that it is best described as the former, since the set of symbols is a set of shapes.
Another similar problem in this example is the location of the domain of mental ability. The activity of writing is a volitional, intentional activity, so it presupposes the domain of mental ability. But mental ability is presupposed by writing because writing presupposes human involvement, and the human involvement involves volition and intention. Determining the exact structure of the array of domains upon which a proﬁled concept is based requires a careful working out of the deﬁnitions of concepts.
A further complication in the relation between proﬁles and domain matrices is that a word sometimes proﬁles a concept in only one of the domains in the domain matrix, or even just a domain deeply nested in the domain structure. The contrast can be illustrated by the concepts PERSON and BODY. PERSON is proﬁled against the abstract domain of HUMAN BEING (along with MAN, WOMAN etc.). The concept of HUMAN BEING is in turn proﬁled against the domain matrix of LIVING THING + MIND: human beings are living things with certain mental states and abilities (recall the classical deﬁnition of man as a rational animal). LIVING THING is in turn proﬁled against the domains of PHYSICAL OBJECT and LIFE: living things are physical objects endowed with life. The concept BODY represents a person’s physical reality (alive or dead). Its base is nevertheless still the abstract domain of HUMAN BEING (or more precisely ANIMAL), but it proﬁles just the PHYSICAL OBJECT domain in the domain structure underlying HUMAN BEINGS. Contrast BODY with SOUL, which proﬁles a nonphysical domain of a human being, what we have called MIND for convenience; or with CORPSE, which proﬁles the PHYSICAL OBJECT domain but also proﬁles a particular region in the LIFE domain, namely DEAD.

28 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
2.5 Domains and idealized cognitive models
An important insight of Fillmore and Lakoff in their early work on frames/domains is that the knowledge represented in the frame is itself a conceptualization of experience that often does not match the reality. The example most cited to illustrate this point in the cognitive literature (not just linguistics but also philosophy, psychology and artiﬁcial intelligence) is the concept of BACHELOR (Fillmore 1975:128–29; 1977a:68–70). A simple conceptual analysis of BACHELOR is an ADULT UNMARRIED MALE. This deﬁnition may suit most normal cases. But there are a number of cases where speakers react with uncertainty as to whether the person involved is a bachelor or not:
(19) a. The Pope b. Tarzan c. An adult male living with his girlfriend d. A male homosexual e. A male homosexual living with his boyfriend f. A seventeen-year-old living on his own, running his own Internet ﬁrm, and dating several women. [cf. a seventeen-year-old living with his parents and going to school, who virtually all agree is not a bachelor]
The apparent problem with the simple deﬁnition of BACHELOR as ADULT UNMARRIED MALE is not that the deﬁnition is too simple (but see below). There is a sense in which the meaning of bachelor really is just ‘adult unmarried male’. It is just that the concept BACHELOR is proﬁled against a frame that does not accommodate the variety of actual social statuses found in the real world (Fillmore 1977a:69; 1982a:117–18). The frame for BACHELOR represents an idealized version of the world that simply does not include all possible real-world situations. Lakoff calls such a frame an idealized cognitive model (ICM; Lakoff 1987, chapter 4).
The analysis proposed in the preceding paragraph makes it look as if the information in the frame for the idealized cognitive model – just ADULT UNMARRIED MALE – is simpler than the reality that often does not match the idealization. But it is not. The ICM for BACHELOR, or rather the ICMs for ADULT, UNMARRIED and MALE have to include much more information than is usually associated with those labels. The ICM for ADULT must include reference to living arrangements, relationships to parents, and occupational activity (see [19b] and [19f]). The ICM for UNMARRIED must include a life history sequence in which adolescence is followed by an absence of lasting sexual relationships and then followed by marriage, without taking vows of celibacy (see [19a] and [19c]). The ICM for MALE must also include sexual orientation (with an eye to reproduction; see [19d] and

Frames, domains, spaces 29
[19e]). In other words, the ICMs for BACHELOR are going to be as detailed and as hedged as reality in order to describe the ‘ideal’ life history and lifestyle that is implied by BACHELOR.
Searle (1979) argues that in fact the frame for any word concept is going to be inﬁnitely complex. Searle is interested in what he calls the background assumptions for deﬁning the literal meaning of words; in frame semantic terms, the background assumptions are the frame(s) for understanding the literal meaning of a linguistic expression. Searle argues that the sort of background knowledge that is relevant to a linguistic expression’s meaning cannot be enumerated in such a way that all contexts of use can be predicted. That is, a basically inﬁnite set of background assumptions are required to characterize the literal meaning of an utterance, and hence its appropriate use in context. Consider the following example (Searle 1979:127):
(20) Give me a hamburger, medium rare, with ketchup and mustard, but easy on the relish.
We assume we understand what the meaning of this request is; we invoke a background frame of fast food restaurants, the ordering and serving of food, how a hamburger is cooked and garnished, and so on. But there is more to it than that:
Suppose for example that the hamburger is brought to me encased in a cubic yard of solid lucite plastic so rigid that it takes a jack hammer to bust it open, or suppose the hamburger is a mile wide and is ‘delivered’ to me by smashing down the wall of the restaurant and sliding the edge of it in. (Searle 1979:127)
These situations are admittedly unlikely to be encountered in real life, in the way that unmarried men living with their girlfriends or homosexual men commonly are encountered. Nevertheless, in the frame for ordering a hamburger we would want to represent the assumptions that it is not supposed to be too large, nor encased in solid lucite plastic, nor any of an indeﬁnitely large number of other things that one could do to a hamburger.
Langacker makes a similar observation with a similar type of example, given in (21) (Langacker 1988:16):
(21) He is barely keeping his head above the water.
We may think we know what this sentence means, but
imagine a race over the ocean by helicopter, where the contestants must transport a severed head, suspended by a rope from the helicopter, from the starting line to the ﬁnish; a contestant is disqualiﬁed if the head he is carrying ever dips below the water’s surface. (Langacker 1988:16–17)

30 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
In other words, we have to bring to bear our full knowledge of the way the world is or, more accurately, the way we expect the world to be, in order to describe the precise meaning of an utterance.
Another way of saying this – the more common way of saying it in cognitive linguistics – is that we have to call on our encyclopedic knowledge in order to properly understand a concept. Some semanticists have argued that only a small subset of our knowledge of a concept needs to be represented as the linguistic meaning of a word; this is known as the dictionary view of linguistic meaning. But the frame semantic model of linguistic meaning highlights the failings of the dictionary view (Fillmore 1982a:134; 1985:233). The dictionary view fails because it generally describes only the concept proﬁle, or at best a very simpliﬁed version of the concept frame implicit in a concept proﬁle (see Haiman 1980 for further arguments; see also Quine 1951[1961]). Once one begins to specify the conceptual structure of the frame that supports the concept proﬁle for a word or linguistic expression, the semantic structure quickly expands to encompass the total (encyclopedic) knowledge that speakers have about the concept symbolized by the word or construction.
Of course, encyclopedic knowledge is all interconnected in our minds. If the meaning of a word includes the frame as well as the proﬁle, then one must abandon the concept of word meanings as small discrete chunks of conceptual structure. Langacker proposes an alternative model of the meaning of a word as an access node into the knowledge network (Langacker 1987:161–64):
The entity designated by a symbolic unit can therefore be thought of as a point of access to a network. The semantic value of a symbolic unit is given by the openended set of relations . . . in which this access node participates. Each of these relations is a cognitive routine, and because they share at least one component the activation of one routine facilitates (but does not always necessitate) the activation of another. (Langacker 1987:163)
A word meaning is therefore a perspective on our knowledge of the world, as seen through the concept proﬁled by the word. This view of word meaning is not that different from the view of a conceptual category in cognitive psychology as a means of accessing further information about the individual categorized. This view of word meaning also highlights how choosing a word is a way of construing the relationship between the experience being communicated and the interlocutors’ existing knowledge.
In the example of the ICM for the word bachelor, the deviations from the ICM were all examples in which it is not clear whether bachelor is applicable to those cases at all. For other words, a modiﬁer is appended to the word to indicate deviation

Frames, domains, spaces 31
from the ICM. For example, Lakoff describes the ICM for mother as involving a cluster of several different ICMs (Lakoff 1987:74–76):
(22) BIRTH: the person giving birth is the mother GENETIC: the female who contributed the genetic material is the mother NURTURANCE: the female adult who nurtures and raises a child is the mother of that child MARITAL: the wife of the father is the mother GENEALOGICAL: the closest female ancestor is the mother
The cluster ICM (as Lakoff names it) is essentially a domain matrix. Thanks both to modern medicine and to traditional social arrangements, the real world has many cases where only parts of the cluster model for MOTHER applies to particular individuals. These deviations from the cluster ICM are indicated by conventional compounds and adjective + noun expressions:
(23) a. stepmother: ﬁts the NURTURANCE and MARITAL models but none of the others
b. foster mother: ﬁts the NURTURANCE model but none of the others c. birth mother: ﬁts the BIRTH model but none, or not all, of the others d. genetic mother: ﬁts the GENETIC model but not all of the others e. unwed mother: ﬁts (probably) all but the MARITAL model [etc.]
Nevertheless, one might still obtain varying results if asking of individuals falling under any of the categories in (23) whether she is the ‘real mother’ of the child (see chapter 5).
In other cases, there is clearly an ICM but linguistic convention has allowed the word, unmodiﬁed, to describe situations that lack some of the properties of the ICM. Fillmore gives the example of the ICM for breakfast, which has as its frame a cycle of meals, and proﬁles ‘the one which is eaten early in the day, after a period of sleep, and for it to consist of a somewhat unique menu’ (Fillmore 1982a:118). But you can work through the night and have eggs, toast and so on at sunup and call it breakfast; you can sleep till 3pm, get up and have eggs, toast and so on and call it breakfast; and you can sleep through the night and in the morning have chocolate cream pie and a martini and call it breakfast (ibid., 118–19). Each of these cases lacks one feature of the ICM for BREAKFAST. One can also call a meal breakfast that lacks both ‘early in the day’ and ‘after a period of sleep’ too: restaurants exist that serve breakfast all day (ibid.; the menu feature appears to be more important than the other two).
Another example similar to BREAKFAST is the ICM for lie (Coleman and Kay 1981). The ICM for LIE, such that a speaker S telling an addressee A the proposition P is a lie, is:

32 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
(24) a. P is false. b. S believes P to be false. c. In uttering P, S intends to deceive A.
Coleman and Kay performed an experiment with stories designed to test every combination of the features listed in (24), and found that, in general, the situations with more of the three properties (24a/b/c) tended to be described by experimental subjects more often as lies than situations with fewer of the properties. Two situations (at least) have conventional expressions that indicate their deviation from the ICM. Polite social lies such as saying What a lovely party! or How nice to see you! can be said in circumstances in which (24a/b) hold but (24c) does not. The other situation can be illustrated with the exchange in (25) (Coleman and Kay 1981:29):
(25) John: Where are you going? Mary: [out to buy John’s birthday present] We’re out of paprika.
In the situation in (25), (24a/b) do not hold but (24c) does (just the opposite of social lies); in this situation an English speaker could say that Mary is being economical with the truth.
In the case of breakfast and lie, the word proﬁle extends to a range of situations whose features vary. Nevertheless, there appears to be agreement as to the situation that counts as the ICM for these words. ICMs thus give rise to judgements of graded centrality to members of a category, a phenomenon that is usually described as prototype effects (see Lakoff 1987 and chapter 4).
2.6 Mental spaces
Semantic frames/domains represent one of the two major organizing principles for conceptual structure. The other important organizing principle is the one illustrated by the examples in (26):
(26) a. Gina bought a sports car. b. Giorgio believes that Gina bought a sports car. c. Paolo believes that Gina bought a pickup truck. d. Gina wants to buy a sports car. e. Gina will buy a sports car. f. If Gina buys a sports car, then she will drive to Paris.
In (26a), a situation is asserted (proﬁled), evoking the frame/domain of commercial transactions. In (26b), the same situation is represented, but as a belief rather than a fact. Example (26c) demonstrates that such beliefs may be at variance with the facts, and with other beliefs. In (27d), the same apparent situation

Frames, domains, spaces 33
is also represented, but it has a different status: the event has not taken place, it is only something in Gina’s mind. In fact, even the sports car may exist only in Gina’s mind. Example (26e) is more similar to (26d) than (26a), even if it is a prediction about the real world: the event has not taken place. Finally, in example (26f) the event is again hypothetical, and so is the event described in the consequent clause.
In a truth-conditional semantics, (26a) is unproblematic, but (26b–f) are. The situation ‘Gina has bought a sports car’ is false in (26d–e), but not necessarily false in (26b–d) or even (26g). One must be able to distinguish between the status of situations depending on whether they are true in the real world, or whether they are only true in someone’s beliefs or desires, or true at another time in the real world.
In a truth-conditional semantics, the standard way of representing the status of situations is as possible worlds: there is the real world, and then there are worlds with situations that are possible but not (necessarily) actual. Possible worlds are then identiﬁed with a person’s beliefs or wishes or some other mental attitude. Possible worlds pose metaphysical problems for many people, however. Do possible worlds exist? If so – or especially if not – where are they?
Fauconnier (1985, 1997; see also Fauconnier and Sweetser 1996) proposes an alternative model of representing the status of knowledge that is metaphysically more attractive and allows for elegant solutions to a number of problems in semantic and pragmatic analysis. Fauconnier replaces the notion of a possible world with that of a mental space, and argues that the mental space is a cognitive structure. That is, the allocation of a situation to ‘Gina’s desire,’ ‘Paolo’s belief’ or ‘The hypothetical situation’ is done in the mind of the speaker (and hearer), not in some as yet unclear metaphysical location. Fauconnier then proposes a set of principles for the interpretation of utterances and the assignment of situations to the appropriate mental space. We brieﬂy present Fauconnier’s model and a number of examples here; the reader should consult his work for detailed arguments in favor of his model over truth-conditional approaches to the same phenomena.
Utterances such as (26a) are normally construed as situating events or states in a base space (Fauconnier 1997:38–39), normally the present reality (more precisely, the mutually known world of the interlocutors; in Fauconnier 1985 this is called the reality space). Utterances such as (27b–f) have elements that Fauconnier describes as space builders: included in their meaning is the setting up of a new space different from the base space and linked to it. Space builders include a wide range of semantic phenomena corresponding not only to possible worlds in logical semantics but also a variety of other operators, including temporal expressions ([27a]; see Fauconnier 1985:29–30, 33–34; Fauconnier 1997, chapter 3), image or ‘picture noun’ contexts ([27b]; Fauconnier 1985:10–12), ﬁctional situations ([27c]; ibid., 73–81), games and other systems ([27d]; ibid, 31), negation

34 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
and disjunction ([27e–f]; ibid., 92, 96–98) and the separate cases in quantiﬁcation ([27g]; see Fauconnier 1986):
(27) a. In 1770, France was a monarchy. b. In the photo, she has black hair. c. In the movie, Ian McKellen is Gandalf. d. In this game, aces are low. e. I don’t have a car. f. Either you take a cab or you walk home. g. Every guest got a receipt.
All of these examples have in common the building of a mental space in which a situation is held to be ‘true’ in that space only. More generally, we can say that just as words and constructions evoke semantic frames/domains, words and constructions also build spaces; at the very least, they ‘build’ or evoke the base space. The relevant word or construction then conventionally speciﬁes that the asserted situation holds in the appropriate space.
Between the base space and any built space, there must be a mapping of the elements found in each space. Many interesting and puzzling semantic and pragmatic phenomena are a product of the possible mappings between spaces. We may divide the phenomena found in the mapping into two parts. First, what do the named elements of the built space (e.g. Gina and sports car) correspond to, if anything, in the base space? Second, what conceptual structures from the base space also occur in the built space(s), and vice versa? We begin with the ﬁrst question.
In (26d), it seems straightforward to say that the person named Gina in the desire space built by Gina wants . . . is mapped onto Gina in the base space. But the object described as a sports car may or may not correspond to anything in the base space: Gina may have seen a particular car on the lot, or she may not have any speciﬁc car in mind. This is the distinction between a speciﬁc and nonspeciﬁc reading, respectively, of a sports car in (26d). The speciﬁc and nonspeciﬁc readings are represented in Figure 2.4.
Fauconnier crucially distinguishes between roles and values in mappings between spaces. A role is a linguistic description describing a category; a value is an individual that can be described by that category. Roles can be a category or type with various instances or tokens; sports car is such a role, since there are many instances (values) of sports cars. A role can also be a category that is ﬁlled by a single individual at one time but by different individuals over time; the President of the United States is an example of such a role. Roles and values are speciﬁc to a single mental space, and all counterpart relations between roles and values in different spaces must be established cognitively by the interlocutors.

Figure 2.4 easily represents the difference between the speciﬁc and nonspeciﬁc readings. In the speciﬁc reading of (26d), the value x of a sports car in Gina’s want space G has a counterpart value x in reality (the car she saw on the lot). In the nonspeciﬁc reading, there is no counterpart value in reality: she imagines a sports car she wants, but has not identiﬁed it with any existing car.
One of Fauconnier’s central insights is that many puzzling semantic phenomena are the result of the fact that a value in one space can be described by the role its counterpart in another space has, even if that role is invalid for the value in the ﬁrst space. This is the Access Principle (Fauconnier 1997:41; it is called the ID Principle in Fauconnier 1985:3). For example, (28) is not contradictory (Fauconnier 1985:29):
(28) In 1929, the lady with white hair was blonde.
The value in the 1929 temporal space – the blonde girl – is being described with a role, lady with white hair, from the base space (the current reality).
Armed with the distinctions between mental spaces, between roles and values within spaces and across spaces, and the Access Principle, Fauconnier goes on to explain a wide range of semantic and pragmatic phenomena using these distinctions. Only a selection of these can be described here.
The phenomenon described as referential opacity is illustrated in 29:
(29) Oedipus wants to marry his mother.
In the Greek myth, (29) is true under one reading (his mother = ‘the person you and I know is Oedipus’ mother’) but false under another (his mother = ‘the person Oedipus believes is his mother’). This distinction is due to the fact that Oedipus does not know that Jocasta is his mother. In mental space terms, the individual value named Jocasta does not ﬁll the role his mother in Oedipus’ belief space, although she does in reality space; see Figure 2.5 (adapted from Fauconnier 1985:49).

In the true reading of (29), the description his mother for j in R is used for the value j in O by the Access Principle. The false reading of (29) uses the description his mother in O, but it does not apply to j in O. (A similar analysis can be applied to referential/attributive ambiguities; Fauconnier 1985:159–60.)
Only a few further examples can be given of how Fauconnier’s model handles a variety of complex reference and identity phenomena (Fauconnier 1985:45, 36, 32, 39, 31, 155):
(30) a. Rose is blonde, but George thinks she’s a redhead. b. Hitchcock saw himself in that movie. c. I didn’t buy a car. Otherwise, I would drive it to work. d. Your car is always different. e. If I were a millionaire, my VW would be a Rolls. f. Hesperus [the Morning Star] is Phosphorus [the Evening Star].
In (30a–b), the pronoun identiﬁes a value in a built space (George’s beliefs, the movie) by referring to its counterpart in the base space (the blonde Rose, Hitchcock). In (30c), the pronoun refers to a value in a negative space which has no counterpart in reality (otherwise . . . would evokes the same negative space; see example [32] below). In (30d), your car refers to a role and the predicate describes its changes in value over a sequence of temporal spaces. In (30e), the value ﬁlling the role a Rolls in the counterfactual space is identiﬁed with the value ﬁlling the role my VW in reality. In (30f), a classic philosophy example, two distinct values in the prior reality space are identiﬁed as one value in the current reality space.
The second set of phenomena that Fauconnier explores is what conceptual structures from the base space also occur in the built space(s), and vice versa. For example, in (26d), how much of our knowledge of reality should be attributed to the hypothetical space? Obviously, one cannot attribute to the hypothetical space the real-world fact that Gina has not bought a sports car; that is precisely what is

Frames, domains, spaces 37
asserted in the hypothetical space. On the other hand, at least other information about Gina, and about sports cars, not to mention much other knowledge about the world, may be attributed to the hypothetical space.
Fauconnier ﬁrst addresses the question of presuppositions (Fauconnier 1985, chapter 3). As noted in §2.1, presuppositions are situations that are part of the frame of a concept, but are not asserted. The question is, what is the relationship of presuppositions in a built space to those in the base space? For example, consider the sentences in (31) (Fauconnier 1985:89–90):
(31) a. If Max has gone to the meeting, then Max’s children are alone. b. If Max has children, Max’s children are American.
The phrase Max’s children presupposes that Max has children; that is, a referring expression presupposes the existence of its referent(s). The traditional pragmatic analysis is that one must determine the presupposition of the whole sentence from the presuppositions of its parts (presupposition projection; see, e.g., Levinson 1985:191–225). In (31a), the presupposition that Max has children ‘projects’ to the base space. But in (31b), it does not project because it is asserted in the antecedent clause: Max may or may not have children in the base space (reality).
Fauconnier instead introduces the principle of presupposition ﬂoat: ‘informally: a presupposition ﬂoats up [from a built space to its base space] until it meets itself or its opposite’ (Fauconnier 1997:61). In example (31a), the built space presupposes that Max has children but does not assert it. Hence the presupposition can ﬂoat to the base space. In example (31b), however, the built space asserts that Max has children, and hence the presupposition cannot ﬂoat beyond it to the base space.
Two more complicated examples are given in (32)–(33) (Fauconnier 1985:95, 93):
(32) It is possible that John has children, and it is possible that John’s children are away.
(33) Luke believes it’s raining and hopes that it will stop raining.
Examples (32)–(33) demonstrate that space builders may build the same space or related nonreal mental spaces. In (32), it is possible in the second conjunct can be construed as evoking the same possibility space that was built in the ﬁrst conjunct. In this case, the presupposition that John has children is asserted in the hypothetical space in the ﬁrst conjunct and therefore it does not ﬂoat to the base space. Example (33) demonstrates that certain built spaces are related in privileged ways that allow presuppositions to ﬂoat (see also McCawley 1981[1993]:415–30). A hope for some situation can be built on one’s beliefs. Hence the presupposition that it is raining in the second clause of (33) is built on the assertion in the ﬁrst clause (and therefore does not ﬂoat to the base space). Reversing the relation between the

38 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
two spaces fails, because beliefs cannot be built on hopes:
(34) ??Luke hopes that it is raining and believes that it will stop raining.
Fauconnier then turns to the question of counterfactual conditionals, as in (35) (Fauconnier 1985, chapter 4; 1997, chapter 4):
(35) If Boris had not come, Olga would have come anyway.
A counterfactual conditional builds a space in which the antecedent clause (Boris does not come) is explicitly the opposite of the base space (Boris did come). Again, the question is, what structures in the base space are also found in the built space? Fauconnier argues that previous, truth-conditional approaches to counterfactuals transfer as much of the structure of the base space as possible to the counterfactual space (Fauconnier 1985:118). Fauconnier instead advocates an analysis in which only the structure relevant for the counterfactual reasoning is transferred to the counterfactual space. He argues that the great ﬂexibility of counterfactuals precludes transferring too much of the structure of the base space to the counterfactual space; compare (36a–d) (ibid.):
(36) a. If Napoleon had been the son of Alexander, he would have been Macedonian. b. If Napoleon had been the son of Alexander, he would have won the battle of Waterloo. c. If Napoleon had been the son of Alexander, he would not have been Napoleon. d. If Napoleon had been the son of Alexander, Alexander would have been Corsican.
Fauconnier writes:
It would not make sense to evaluate the ‘absolute’ truth of any of these statements, but they can all be used to make some point, which requires only very partial structuring of H [the counterfactual space] . . . such examples suggest that there is no general linguistic algorithm for going from R [the base space] to H. (Fauconnier 1985:118)
In Fauconnier’s more recent work (Fauconnier 1997, chapter 6; Fauconnier and Turner 2002; see also Coulson 2000), he and Turner have emphasized the fact that information from two different spaces, such as those in the counterfactual conditionals in (36a–d), is blended in the resulting space, and that this blending process occurs in a much wider range of contexts than counterfactual conditionals. For example, (37) blends elements of a voyage by the catamaran Great America II from Boston to San Francisco in 1993 with a voyage by the clipper Northern Light on the same route in 1853 (Fauconnier 1997:155–56; see Fauconnier and Turner 1994):

Frames, domains, spaces 39
(37) At this point, Great America II is barely maintaining a 4.5 day lead over Northern Light.
Obviously, Northern Light is nowhere to be seen in 1993, but the blend of the 1853 temporal space and the 1993 temporal space in (37) ‘makes a point’ about the progress of Great America II. In Fauconnier and Turner’s blending theory, example (37) evokes four mental spaces: two input spaces (in [37], the 1853 and 1993 temporal spaces); a generic space, which abstracts the commonalities from the two spaces (the route of travel, distance traversed, time taken etc.) and thereby deﬁnes the cross-space mapping between the elements in the two input spaces; and a blended space, which creates a novel expressive effect, in this case an image of a race between the current boat and a boat from the nineteenth century. Fauconnier and Turner (2002) argue that blending is a process of space mapping that pervades human reasoning, and explore the phenomenon of blending in a wide range of phenomena, most notably metaphor.
At this point, blending theory has moved quite a distance from mental space theory. Mental space theory illustrates how utterances evoke not just semantic frames but also spaces representing the status of our knowledge (beliefs, desires, hypotheticals, counterfactuals) relative to reality, how language uses links between different spaces in referring to individuals, and how knowledge can ﬂoat between spaces. Blending theory has shifted the focus to how information from two spaces, construed broadly to include domains, is combined to produce novel conceptual structures. This aspect of blending theory is discussed with respect to metaphor in §8.3.3. In this chapter we have focused on the fact that the original mental space theory describes a signiﬁcant dimension for the structuring of our conceptual knowledge orthogonal to semantic frames/domains, and offers solutions to many semantic and pragmatic problems in addition to those illustrated in this section.

Conceptualization and construal operations
3.1 Introduction
In chapter 1, we noted that one of the basic hypotheses of cognitive linguistics is that, in Langacker’s words, semantics is conceptualization. This hypothesis challenges the view that semantics is purely truth-conditional. We have already seen in chapter 2 examples of semantic interpretations of linguistic expressions that go beyond truth-conditional semantics. Situations can be framed in different ways – e.g., my dad vs. dad vs. father and waste time vs. spend time in My dad wasted most of the morning on the bus (see §2.1) – and these ways convey to the hearer different conceptualizations of the relationship between the speaker and the speaker’s father, of the positive or negative quality of the situation being described, and even of the nature of the situation being described (characterizing time in terms of money).
Framing is pervasive in language: as we argued in chapter 2, all linguistic units evoke a semantic frame. Yet framing is but one example of the ubiquity of conceptualization in linguistic expression. All aspects of the grammatical expression of a situation involve conceptualization in one way or another, including inﬂectional and derivational morphology and even the basic parts of speech. Whenever we utter a sentence, we unconsciously structure every aspect of the experience we intend to convey. The purpose of this chapter is to describe the range of conceptualization processes or construal operations that human beings employ in language.
The role of conceptualization in language is clearest when a single language provides alternative expressions for what appears to be truth-functionally equivalent situations. The example of framing given above contrasts different lexical expressions – dad/father and spend/waste – that otherwise appear to be truth-functionally equivalent. (We deliberately hedge on the phrase ‘truthfunctionally equivalent’ because it often turns out that there are some situations that so favor one conceptualization over another that the other expression is unacceptable and so the two expressions are not always judged as truthfunctionally equivalent.) But it is equally easy to ﬁnd examples of inﬂectional and
40

Conceptualization and construal operations 41
derivational contrasts between otherwise approximately truth-functionally equivalent expressions:

(1)

a. leaves on the tree

b. foliage-Ø on the tree

(2)

a. Conor lives in New York City.

b. Conor is living in New York City.

(3)

a. The chimney is above the window.

b. The window is below the chimney.

(4)

a. Something moved in the grass.

b. There was a movement in the grass.

(5)

a. The car brushed the bicycle.

b. The bicycle was brushed by the car.

(6)

a. There was Sam sitting on the ﬂoor.

b. Sam was sitting on the ﬂoor.

Examples (1a–b) and (2a–b) differ in the choice of nominal and verbal inﬂection, (1a–b) by plural count noun and mass noun, and (2a–b) by the choice of a simple vs. a progressive form. Examples (3a–b) differ in the choice of a function word, in this case a preposition, and a reversal of subject and prepositional complement choice. Examples (4a–b) differ derivationally in part of speech, between a verb and its derived noun. Examples (5a–b) and (6a–b) differ in the grammatical construction used to describe the scene, active vs. passive voice in (5) and presentational vs. ordinary declarative in (6). All of these sentences seem to be truth-functionally equivalent. But English is not being unnecessarily proﬂigate here: the a and b members offer a different conceptualization of the experience in every case. These and other examples will be explicated in the following sections.
Similar evidence is found in cases when the same word can be used with two different inﬂections, derivations or constructions, and there are subtle but deﬁnite conventional truth-functional differences in the two uses:

(7)

a. We have chocolate-Ø for dessert.

b. We have chocolates for dessert.

(8)

a. Ira is a nuisance.

b. Ira, stop being a nuisance!

(9)

a. Timmy is in front of the tree.

b. Timmy is behind the tree.

(10) a. Jill is fussy. b. Jill is a fussbudget. (Bolinger 1980:79)

(11) a. The dog chewed the bone. b. The dog chewed on the bone.

42 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
In (7a), the mass noun refers to a substance, but in (7b), the same noun as a count noun refers to an object which is covered with the substance but may or may not be ﬁlled with the same substance. In (8a), the simple present describes a behavioral trait of Ira’s, while (8b) describes a particular activity of his. Examples (9a) and (9b) differ in Timmy’s position relative to the speaker and the tree; to make (9a) and (9b) truth-functionally equivalent, the speaker would have to move to the other side of the tree. Example (10a) describes a behavioral trait of Jill, but (10b) describes the same trait as a constant (and annoying) aspect of Jill’s personality. In example (11a), the object role of the bone indicates that the bone itself is being affected by the dog’s action, but in (11b), the oblique role indicates that it is only meat and gristle on the bone that is being affected.
The examples in (7)–(11) are equally indicative of the role of construal in language as the examples in (1)–(6). The truth-functional differences in (7)–(11) are indicative of favored conceptualizations that have led to the extension of a particular construal to a situation that does not (easily) allow for alternative construals. For example, the fact that certain sweets come in individuated units allows for a construal of the substance noun chocolate as a count noun (compare I’d like an orange juice, please), and chocolate as a count noun is extended to other such sweets where only the (perceptually salient) outer surface is made of chocolate. But both a chocolate and an orange juice share the construal as an individuated unit, even if the link to the substance is more tenuous in the former case. In fact, in cognitive linguistics conceptualization is the fundamental semantic phenomenon; whether alternative construals give rise to differences in truth conditions or not is a derivative semantic fact.
In some cases where construal is accompanied by a truth-functional semantic shift in meaning, English allows speakers to express the construal-plus-shift overtly, as in:
(12) Stop acting like a nuisance! (13) I’d like a glass of orange juice, please.
Example (12) uses the process verb act and a manner construction to denote the activity and (13) uses a container word glass and the partitive construction to denote the individuated amount of juice. This is not always possible in English; for example, a chocolate does not have an obvious overt expression of its individuation, and there is no simple overt expression of the different types of chewing actions in (11a–b).
Other languages require overt expression of construal-plus-shift, in contrast to English. For example, Vietnamese cannot simply use a mass noun in a count noun construction or vice versa, as English does in (7); and Russian requires overt marking in the following examples were English does not:

Conceptualization and construal operations 43

(14) a. soloma

‘straw’ [mass]

b. solom-ink-a ‘a straw’ [count (American English)]

(15) a. On kricˇal.

‘He cried/was crying’ [multiple times]

b. On krik-nu-l. ‘He cried’ [once]

In (14b), Russian requires the singulative sufﬁx -ink before the gender-case inﬂection -a in order to use the mass noun stem solom- in a count construction; English simply uses straw in either construction (with a concomitant truth-conditional semantic shift). In (15b), Russian requires the semelfactive sufﬁx -nu before the past inﬂection -l in order to use the extended-activity verb stem krik- in the onceonly construal; English simply uses cry in the simple past or the past progressive (with the relevant semantic shift).
Thus, there is cross-linguistic and language-internal variation as to whether construal plus truth-conditional semantic shift is expressed covertly or overtly. We will call the former coercion and the latter conversion.1 We see no signiﬁcant difference between coercion and conversion in conceptual semantic terms; in both cases, the truth-conditional semantic shift that accompanies the construal is conventionalized in the language, and cannot be assumed to carry over to other languages or even other words in the same language. In both cases, what we are interested in is the construal process itself, and this is a part of both conversion and coercion.
There are many construal operations that have been identiﬁed by cognitive linguists, and by other linguists who take a conceptualist approach to linguistic semantics. There have also been various proposals for grouping together construal operations that appear to be related. The two most comprehensive classiﬁcations are those of Talmy and Langacker. Talmy proposes a four-way classiﬁcation under the name of imaging systems (Talmy 1977, 1978a, 1988a,b), given in (16):2

(16)

I. Structural Schematization

II. Deployment of Perspective

III. Distribution of Attention

IV. Force Dynamics

Langacker surveys a wide range of construal operations under the rubric of focal adjustments (Langacker 1987, §3.3); his classiﬁcation of focal adjustments

1 There is no uniformity in terminology in the literature, unfortunately: ‘coercion,’ ‘conversion’ and ‘shift’ have all been used for the covert case.
2 Talmy somewhat alters this classiﬁcation in the version found in Talmy (2000), and changes their name to schematic systems. The ﬁrst three categories are basically the same (the ﬁrst is renamed conﬁgurational structure), while force dynamics is dropped entirely and a system called ‘Domain’, consisting solely of the domains of space and time, is added. The ‘Domain’ category includes the construals represented by noun and verb (see §§3.2, 3.5). We believe that force dynamics should be retained as a construal system; see Table 3.1.

44 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis is given in (17):

(17)

I. Selection

II. Perspective

A. Figure/Ground

B. Viewpoint

C. Deixis

D. Subjectivity/Objectivity

III. Abstraction

Talmy’s and Langacker’s classiﬁcations have a number of features in common: for example, both have categories of perspective, and Talmy’s attentional imaging system includes Langacker’s selection and abstraction focal adjustments. These classiﬁcations are not comprehensive, however. Fillmore’s framing is a construal operation, for example, but does not obviously fall under the categories in either Talmy’s or Langacker’s classiﬁcations. Lakoff and Johnson’s (1980) theory of metaphor is an example of another widespread type of linguistic conceptualization that is not discussed explicitly by either Langacker or Talmy. Langacker himself makes use of other construal operations, such as scanning, comparison and the entity/interconnection distinction, that he does not include in his classiﬁcation of focal adjustments.
There is another theoretical construct in cognitive linguistics which imposes a conceptualization of experience, namely image schemas (Lakoff 1987; Johnson 1987; Lakoff and Turner 1989; Johnson 1987; Clausner and Croft 1999). Image schemas are deﬁned as schematic versions of images. Images are representations of speciﬁc, embodied experiences (see Fillmore 1975:123; 1977a:73–74). Domains that give rise to images are described as embodied (Lakoff 1987:267; Johnson 1987:19–23) or grounded (Lakoff and Turner 1989:113). These domains are all basic domains as deﬁned in §2.4. Image schemas are not speciﬁc images but are schematic. They represent schematic patterns arising from imagistic domains, such as containers, paths, links, forces, and balance that recur in a variety of embodied domains and structure our bodily experience (Lakoff 1987:453; Johnson 1987:29). Image schemas are also not speciﬁc to a particular sensory modality (Lakoff 1987:267; Johnson 1987:24–25). Image schemas structure our bodily experience (Talmy 1972, 1977, 1983), and they structure our non-bodily experience as well, via metaphor (Lakoff 1987:453; Johnson 1987:29; see chapter 8). This deﬁnition clariﬁes the seemingly contradictory description of image schemas sometimes found: image schemas are ‘abstract’ in one sense of that word – they are schematic – but not ‘abstract’ in another sense of that word – they are embodied.

Image schemas are also construals of experience, though they exhibit some of the characteristics of domains as well (see §3.5).
In this chapter, we present all of the construal operations and image schemas discussed by cognitive linguists under a new classiﬁcation.3 This classiﬁcation is given in Table 3.1 on page 46.
A chief aim of this classiﬁcation is to demonstrate the close relationship between construal operations proposed by linguists and psychological processes proposed by cognitive psychologists and phenomenologists. If linguistic construal operations are truly cognitive, then they should be related to, or identical with, general cognitive processes that are postulated by psychologists. In fact, most if not all of these construal operations are special cases of general cognitive processes described in psychology and phenomenology. This view follows from the basic hypothesis of cognitive linguistics that language is an instance of general cognitive abilities.
The classiﬁcation of construal operations in Table 3.1 is not intended to be a reduction of construal operations to just four processes. The various construal operations listed under the four headings are all distinct cognitive processes. The analysis we propose is that the various construal operations are manifestations of the four basic cognitive abilities in different aspects of experience. The remainder of this chapter describes and illustrates the construal operations under these four headings.

3 An earlier version of this classiﬁcation is presented in Croft and Wood 2000.

3.2 Attention/salience
The process of attention is a well-known basic phenomenon in cognitive psychology. Attention appears to be closest to what Chafe (1994:26–30) calls the focus of consciousness. Attention comes in degrees and is usually modeled in terms of degree of activation of conceptual structures in a neural network

Conceptualization and construal operations 47
model of the mind. The phenomenon of attention focuses on the human cognitive ability involved, but there are also natural properties of phenomena in the perceived world that lend themselves to being attended to by human beings, and these properties are said to enhance those phenomena’s salience to human beings’ attention.
Attention is a complex psychological ability whose different aspects can be most easily illustrated by visual ability: one can select one object or another to focus one’s attention on; focus of attention is surrounded by a scope of attention; one can take a more coarse-grained or more ﬁne-grained view of a scene; and one can ﬁx one’s gaze on a scene or move one’s eye over it. These four aspects of attention are found across all domains of thought.
3.2.1 Selection
The focal adjustment of selection is our ability to attend to parts of our experience that are relevant to the purpose at hand and ignore aspects of our experience that are irrelevant. The phenomenon of proﬁling a concept in a semantic frame, described in detail in chapter 2, is an example of selection. In most cases, different words in a semantic frame or domain focus our attention on the different elements in the frame, for example radius, arc, circumference in the CIRCLE frame. In other cases, derivational morphology shifts the proﬁle, as in writer, whose -er sufﬁx shifts the proﬁle of write from process to agent. The participant that the -er sufﬁx selects is not ﬁxed to a single participant role but depends on salience, manifest both in conventionalized forms such as stapler (the instrument) or in novel forms such as clapper (Jane T., describing a lamp that turns on when you clap your hands).
Selection of the proﬁle by a single underived word stem is also ﬂexible and subject to construal. For example, many English nouns are also used as verbs (Clark and Clark 1979): pan can be construed as proﬁling either a metal object or a process in the GOLDSEEKING frame. Both the process and the metal object are salient in this frame, hence the choice of one word for both. Likewise, British English speakers can construe bin as proﬁling either a wastebasket or the action of tossing something into the wastebasket.
Such examples are not usually analyzed as examples of construal since the proﬁle is of course central to a word’s meaning and any shift in proﬁle has truthfunctional consequences. However, two semantic processes that involve subtler and/or more systematic shifts in proﬁle lend themselves to a construal analysis.
The ﬁrst example is the highlighting of different facets (see chapter 5) or domains in a domain matrix, as in (19)–(22):

(20) a. Paris is a beautiful city. (location) b. Paris closed the Boulevard St. Michel. (government) c. Paris elected the Green candidate as mayor. (population)
(21) a. The Chronicle costs a dollar. (tome) b. The Chronicle called for his resignation. (editor) c. The Chronicle went bankrupt. (company)
(22) a. The window is dirty. (pane) b. She came in through the bathroom window. (opening)
A newspaper, book or other embodied text is simultaneously a physical tome and a meaningful text. But (19a) selects the physical object facet and (19b) only the text facet. The range of possible proﬁled facets for a word can be quite wide. For example, (20c) selects the voting members of the population, but All Paris turned out to see the king selects a wider (but still incomplete) set of the population. The government in (20b) is the city government; but Paris opposes any reform of the Common Agricultural Policy proﬁles the national government by virtue of Paris being the capital of France. It is not clear whether different facets count as different senses; see §5.3.1 for further discussion.
The second example is the phenomenon of metonymy. Metonymy is, loosely, the use of a word to denote a concept other than its ‘literal’ denotation. Examples of metonymy include the following (Nunberg 1995:115; Langacker 1991b:189):
(23) That french fries is getting impatient. (24) They played lots of Mozart. (25) She heard the piano. (26) I’m in the phone book.
A cognitive linguistic analysis of metonymy is the ability of a speaker to select a different contextually salient concept proﬁle in a domain or domain matrix than the one usually symbolized by the word. In (23)–(24), it is the nouns (french fries and Mozart) whose concept proﬁles are shifted. The evidence for this analysis is found in the grammar of the sentences. In (23), although french fries is plural, the demonstrative modifying it and the verb are singular, indicating that french fries is proﬁling the single individual who has ordered french fries. In (24), although Mozart is countable, the quantiﬁer modifying it is used with mass nouns, indicating that Mozart is proﬁling the abstract uncountable music of Mozart.
In (25)–(26), however, Langacker argues that it is the verbs whose concept proﬁles are shifted. This shift in verb concept proﬁle is an example of what Langacker describes as an active zone analysis. In an active zone analysis the relational predication – a verb, adjective, adverb or preposition – adjusts its meaning to accommodate its semantic argument, and incorporates the ‘literal’ argument as its

Conceptualization and construal operations 49
active zone. Thus, in (25) the meaning of heard is ‘S b j heard the sound of Obj’ – compare She heard the sound of the piano – and the active zone in the verb meaning is the sound emitted by the object referent. In (26) the meaning of be in (the phone book) is ‘Sbj’s name is printed in Loc’, and the active zone is a name and its relation to the subject referent.
Langacker argues that the difference between (27a–c) is due to alternative construals of the adjective, not a syntactic alternation:
(27) a. To play Monopoly is fun. b. Monopoly is fun to play. c. Monopoly is fun.
In transformational analyses, be fun in (27b) is semantically identical to be fun in (27a), and (27b) is syntactically derived by a movement of Monopoly to the main clause subject position (‘Tough-movement’). In Langacker’s analysis, (27b) is not syntactically derived from (27a). Instead, be fun in (27b) is semantically distinct from be fun in (27a); (27a) takes an entity as its subject and has the activity carried out on the subject referent as its active zone. Support for the active zone analysis is suggested by (27c): the clause from which the subject would be moved in the syntactic analysis is absent, and yet (27c) is acceptable, with an interpretation of be fun as in (27b).
The active zone analysis of (25)–(26) is the opposite of the traditional metonymy analysis, in which it is the noun phrase that shifts proﬁle (the piano to the sound of the piano, I to my name). The verb (adjective, preposition) semantic shift is quite different from the usual examples of metonymy on verb phrases, where, for example, go to the bathroom is metonymic for ‘perform certain bodily functions’, and pick up the phone in If you want to ﬁnd out, you’ve only got to pick up the phone is metonymic for a more complex activity. In these latter examples, the proﬁle is shifted from one event to an associated event in the same semantic frame. The semantic shift of the relational predicate in the active zone analysis for (25)–(26) serves a different function.
Nunberg (1995) argues for a distinction between noun and verb semantic shift (the latter equivalent to the active zone analysis), or ‘predicate transfer’ as he calls it, using evidence from grammatical behavior such as that cited above for (23)– (24). Nunberg argues that one advantage of the active zone analysis is that in a sentence such as Roth is Jewish and widely read, one can account for the lack of zeugma by analyzing widely read as taking the author as subject, not his books; hence the subjects are truly coreferential (Nunberg 1995:122–23); but see §5.3.1 for an alternative analysis of the same phenomenon in facets.
Whichever is the best analysis for examples such as (25)–(26), the phenomenon of proﬁle shift (semantic shift) appears to be a function of salience. Langacker

50 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
notes that in (25)–(26), and (27b–c) as well, the effect of the semantic shift is to allow a more salient entity to be the semantic as well as syntactic argument of the verb (I instead of my name, the piano instead of the sound of the piano, Monopoly instead of to play Monopoly; Langacker 1991b:193). Nunberg argues that the primary ‘pragmatic’ constraint on predicate transfer is the noteworthiness of the relationship of the predicate to its argument in the context – in cognitive linguistic terms, its salience in the semantic frame. For example, I’m in the Whitney Museum (said by an artist about her painting) confers a noteworthy property to the artist of being represented in a major museum; the same artist saying ??I’m in the second crate on the right does not (Nunberg 1995:113). Nunberg also notes that noteworthiness is subject to construal: a jealous painter might say Those daubers get one-person shows while I’m relegated to a crate in the basement (ibid., 129, n. 7).
3.2.2 Scope of attention (dominion)
The second aspect of attention is that the focus of attention – what is selected – is surrounded by a scope of attention, that is, a periphery of consciousness where entities are accessible to attention (Chafe 1994:29). We saw an example of scope of attention in §2.4, example (18e), repeated in (28):
(28) ??A body has twenty-eight knuckles.
In the scope of predication, the domains immediately presupposed by a proﬁled concept are accessible in a way that more indirectly presupposed domains are not (see §2.4, example [18]). This is a matter of construal; the scope of predication can shift in the appropriate context as in (29):
(29) A: We’ve found every bit of the body, sir – even the knuckles. B: How many did you ﬁnd? A: Twenty-seven, sir. B: Come on, now! How many knuckles does a body have? A: Oh, you’re right, sir. Twenty-eight.
Another example of a grammatical constraint that makes reference to the scope of attention has to do with a combination of locative expressions specifying a location:
(30) The money is in the kitchen, under the counter, in the lefthand cabinet, on the top shelf, behind the meat grinder.
Each locative expression proﬁles an entity in the scope deﬁned by the preceding locative expression (i.e., the locative expression deﬁnes successively narrower search domains; Langacker 1987:286). Scrambling the order of locative

Conceptualization and construal operations 51
expressions creates cognitive chaos:
(31) The money is on the top shelf, in the kitchen, under the counter, behind the meat grinder, in the lefthand cabinet.
Yet another example of scope of attention is the notion of accessibility of a referent in discourse (Ariel 1990; Gundel et al. 1993; Chafe 1994). Consider the passage given in (32), from the Pear Stories narratives (Chafe 1980):
(32) And then deﬁnitely when he’s up there, . . a kid comes by on a bicycle. From the direction where the goat man left, okay? A–nd . . u–m the bicycle’s way too big for the kid. I’m giving you all these details. I don’t know if you want them.
A third person pronoun such as them construes the referent as being in the focus of attention of the hearer, which is appropriate in (32) because the details have just been mentioned. However, when details is ﬁrst uttered, the details are not in the focus of attention – they have not been mentioned as such – but they are in the scope of attention – the description in the preceding intonation units has been about the details of the ﬁlm. The choice of the proximal demonstrative adjective these details construes the details as being in the hearer’s scope of attention but not in focus (Gundel et al. 1993:275).
Langacker proposes a highly generalized concept of scope in terms of the dominion made accessible by a reference point which functions as the (initial) focus of attention (Langacker 1999, chapter 6). Langacker argues that reference point and dominion constitute the construal underlying the possessive construction: the ‘possessor’ in examples such as my watch, your anxiety and Lincoln’s assassination functions as a reference point to establish a dominion in which the appropriate referent of the head noun can be selected. Langacker also extends his analysis to metonymy. For example, in (20c) above, the speaker focuses the hearer’s attention on the city of Paris by using Paris. Paris then functions as a reference point whose scope or dominion includes its inhabitants; the inhabitants of Paris are therefore accessible as the subject referent for the predicate. Choosing The people of Paris instead of Paris in (20c) would construe the situation differently, putting the people in the focus of attention instead of in the dominion of another focus.
3.2.3 Scalar adjustment
The third aspect of attention is an adjustment of the scale of attention. It can be illustrated with a visual example (Talmy 1983:238):

52 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
(33) a. She ran across the ﬁeld. b. She ran through the ﬁeld.
Examples (33a–b) could describe the same scene, but (33b) invites the hearer to attend to the thickness of the vegetation in the ﬁeld by using a preposition requiring a three-dimensional volume; (33a) instead construes the ﬁeld as a twodimensional surface without thickness. To describe the conceptualization involved here, a metaphor of magniﬁcation or granularity is often used. Example (33a) offers a coarse-grained view of the ﬁeld, seen as if from a distance so that the thickness of whatever covers the ﬁeld is invisible to us. Example (33b) offers a ﬁne-grained view of the ﬁeld, as if our view was magniﬁed to reveal its thickness. Examples (34a–c) provide a more elaborate example of granularity:
(34) a. We drove along the road. b. A squirrel ran across the road. c. The construction workers dug through the road.
In (34a), the road is viewed at such a coarse grain that it is conceptualized as a line, which provides a path for movement. In (34b–c), the same difference in granularity is found as in (33a–b): in (34b) the road is construed as a twodimensional surface that can be traversed, and in (34c), the road is construed as a three-dimensional volume whose depth in this case can be an obstacle. At a coarse-grained view, the road’s width and depth are reduced and lost, and the road is merely one-dimensional. At a more ﬁne-grained view, or a greater magniﬁcation, the width of the road becomes visible, so to speak, and at a still ﬁner-grained view/magniﬁcation, the depth becomes visible as well.
Examples (33)–(34) illustrate quantitative scalar adjustment:4 a construal of an object by adjusting the granularity of the scalar dimensions, in this case the three spatial dimensions. Scalar adjustment is found in other measurable dimensions as well. For example, part of the difference in the construals of (2a–b) and (8a–b) in §3.1 is due to temporal scalar adjustment. In both cases, the progressive evokes a ﬁner-grained scale than the simple present. In (8a), Ira’s nuisance extends over a long period of time, possibly his entire lifetime; but in (8b), Ira’s nuisance extends only over a brief time, that of his objectionable activity. In (2a), Conor’s time in New York is conceived of as permanent, or at least construed as long-term, while in (2b), it is construed as short-term or temporary in the context of his lifetime.
Langacker also includes what he calls schematization under the same category. Schematization, that is, viewing something by means of a more encompassing
4 Langacker calls this ‘abstraction,’ but that term is used for such a wide range of theoretical concepts, even in cognitive linguistics, that we choose a more precise term here.

Conceptualization and construal operations 53
category, is a qualitative scalar adjustment: rather than losing a measurable scale or dimension, one loses irrelevant properties. For instance, triangle speciﬁes the number of sides of the shape, but the more schematic polygon, which could be used to describe the same shape, is vague as to the number of sides it possesses (Langacker 1987:135). A word or construction that is vague rather than ambiguous with respect to a semantic property is an example of schematization. Possessing an indeterminate or nonrestrictive property is not the same as lacking the property: polygons have sides, even if the concept of a polygon is indeterminate with respect to that feature. Schematization is a phenomenon of attention: the concept of a polygon ignores the number of sides to any particular subtype of polygon, in contrast to the concept of a triangle. One can also ﬁnd differences in schematization in frames as well as proﬁles. To take an example from §2.3, the frame for the English word eat is vague as to whether the eater is human or animal, unlike German essen and fressen. More generally, the choice of words at different levels of categorization (see chapter 4) to refer to an object will construe the object at different levels of schematization.
3.2.4 Dynamic attention
Focus, scope and scale of attention are all static construals of a scene. The fourth aspect of attention is that it can be dynamic: one’s attention can move across a scene. That this is a matter of conceptualization, not just a fact about the world, can be seen in (35) (see Talmy 2000, chapter 2):
(35) The road winds through the valley and then climbs over the high mountains.
The road is not actually going anywhere, but it is conceptualized as if it is: the mind’s eye, so to speak, represents one as going along the road. Talmy describes this as ﬁctive motion, because it is a construal of a static scene in dynamic terms. Of course, most of the time speakers construe static scenes statically and dynamic scenes dynamically; this underlies the distinction between state and process in predicates (see §3.6). But example (35) and many similar examples demonstrate that this semantic property is subject to construal.
Langacker also makes use of the static/dynamic attentional contrast in construal, but for a different phenomenon. One of the basic conceptual distinctions between predicates (prototypically verbs) and arguments or modiﬁers (nouns and adjectives), according to Langacker, is the mode of scanning of the scene. Langacker distinguishes summary scanning, a holistic conceptualization of a scene in its entirety, and sequential scanning, a scanning of a scene in conceived time, which is not the same as objective time (Langacker 1987:144–45, 248–49). For example, when a verb predicates an action as in Boston Bridge collapsed, the event is

54 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
scanned sequentially, over time. In contrast, when the verb is nominalized in a referring expression such as the collapse of Boston Bridge, the event is construed summarily as a whole unit without being scanned through time, even though the event occurred objectively through an interval of time (compare move vs. movement in examples [4a–b] in §3.1). Summary scanning is the norm for nouns denoting objects when used as referring expressions, such as the tree or the lamp, and for modiﬁers such as tall in the tall tree.
Summary/sequential scanning is not the same as ﬁctive motion. Fictive motion represents the state/process construal, but summary/sequential scanning underlies the difference between sentence predication and nonpredicated states of affairs. For Langacker, The road is in the valley involves sequential scanning because it is predicated, but The road winding through the valley involves summary scanning because the (ﬁctive) motion of the road is not predicated.
3.3 Judgement/comparison
Kant describes judgement, which he considers a fundamental cognitive faculty, as a particular kind of comparison: ‘judgement in general is the faculty of thinking the particular as contained under the universal’ (Kant 1790[1952]:18). Husserl, generalizing over the Western philosophical tradition from Aristotle onwards, gives judgement the more general meaning of a comparison between two entities: ‘the most general characteristic of the predicative judgement is that it has two members: a “substrate” (hypokeimenon), about which something is afﬁrmed, and that which is afﬁrmed of it (kategoroumenon)’ (Husserl 1948[1973]:14, emphasis original). Langacker also considers comparison to be a fundamental cognitive operation (Langacker 1987:103–5). Thus we may link the fundamental philosophical concept of judgement to the cognitive psychological process of comparison.
3.3.1 Categorization
Perhaps the most fundamental judgement of comparison is categorization, which was described in terms of framing in chapter 2. The act of categorization – applying a word, morpheme or construction to a particular experience to be communicated – involves comparison of the experience in question to prior experiences and judging it to belong to the class of prior experiences to which the linguistic expression has been applied. There are many ways in which a situation can be compared and judged to be like a prior experience. As we saw in §2.3, the choice of a linguistic category based on comparison to a prior situation frames – construes – the

Conceptualization and construal operations 55
current situation in different ways, as in fetus vs. unborn baby or thrifty vs. stingy. In addition to the ﬂexibility of framing a situation by comparing it to one or another prior situation, speakers also have the ﬂexibility of comparing the current situation to a prior one and in effect redeﬁning the frame. For example, upon entering a holding pattern over Milan airport, a pilot said We’ll be on the path they call a racetrack; that’s essentially a circle with two straight sides – a signiﬁcant reconceptualization of the category CIRCLE.
Langacker describes the comparison process between the current situation and the category to which it is assigned as sanction (Langacker 1987:66–71). He recognizes a gradient between full sanction – unproblematic subsumption of the new situation – and partial sanction – a more creative extension of the category to the current situation. Categorization involves schematization (§3.2) as well as judgement: in comparing the new experience to prior ones and categorizing it in one way over another, we attend to some characteristics and ignore others. The pervasiveness of construal in the process of categorization has already been discussed in chapter 2 and will be described in detail in chapter 4.
3.3.2 Metaphor
Another construal operation widely discussed in cognitive linguistics, metaphor, also involves judgement or comparison. Metaphor involves a relationship between a source domain, the source of the literal meaning of the metaphorical expression, and a target domain, the domain of the experience actually being described by the metaphor. For example, to waste time involves comparing TIME (the target domain) to MONEY (the source domain) in the metaphor represented by the Lakofﬁan formula t i m e i s m o n e y (Lakoff and Johnson 1980). Time is construed as a valuable asset that is possessed by human beings and can be ‘used’ in the same way that money is.
The choice of metaphor to describe a situation in a particular domain construes the structure of that domain in a particular way that differs depending on the metaphor chosen. For example, the metaphor in stockmarket crash construes the low level of the market as abnormal, the result of defective operation, whereas a high (or rising) market is normal. On the other hand, stockmarket correction construes the low level of the market as normal, its correct level, whereas the high level is abnormal.
The exact relationship between the source and target domains in a metaphorical expression is a matter of debate within cognitive linguistics. Metaphor, like categorization, is sufﬁciently important for conceptualization to merit its own chapter in this book (chapter 8), and is discussed in greater detail there.

56 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis

3.3.3 Figure-ground alignment
A third example of comparison as a linguistic construal is ﬁgure-ground alignment. Figure-ground alignment appears to be strongly inﬂuenced by objective properties of the scene, although they can be overridden in various ways (that is, it is subject to construal). The ﬁgure-ground distinction is derived from Gestalt psychology (e.g. Koffka 1935, ch. 5), introduced into cognitive linguistics by Talmy (Talmy 1972, 1983, 2000).
Talmy uses the ﬁgure-ground relation to account for the expression of spatial relations in natural language. All spatial relations in language – both location (36) or motion (37) – are expressed by specifying the position of one object, the ﬁgure, relative to another object, the ground (sometimes more than one ground object, as in [38]–[39]):

(36) The book [ﬁgure] is on the ﬂoor [ground]. (37) Sheila [ﬁgure] went into the house [ground]. (38) The Isaac CDs [ﬁgure] are between Compe`re [ground] and Josquin [ground]. (39) Greg [ﬁgure] drove from San Rafael [ground] to Trinidad [ground] in ﬁve
hours.

The ﬁgure and ground are asymmetrical. Although near is a spatially symmetrical preposition, (40b) sounds odd compared to (40a) (Talmy 2000:314):

(40) a. The bike is near the house. b. ??The house is near the bike.

Likewise, there is no preposition that functions as the inverse of in in (41a) (from Leonard Talmy), because the ﬁgure-ground orientation is quite unnatural:

(41) a. There’s a crocodile in the water. b. ??There’s water ‘being-a-suspending-medium-for’ the crocodile.

Talmy identiﬁes the following properties of objects that favor ﬁgure or ground construal, in the narrower domain of spatial relations (based on Talmy 1983:230– 31; see Talmy 2000:315–16):

(42) Figure

Ground

location less known

location more known

smaller

larger

more mobile

more stationary

structurally simpler

structurally more complex

more salient

more backgrounded

more recently in awareness earlier on scene/in memory

Nevertheless, ﬁgure-ground relations can be manipulated. The same object can function as ﬁgure in one context and ground in another, as in (43a–b); and the

Conceptualization and construal operations 57
favoring contexts can also be overridden for the opposite ﬁgure-ground construal, with appropriate contextualization, as in (44):
(43) a. The cat [ﬁgure] is on the table [ground]. b. I found a ﬂea [ﬁgure] on the cat [ground].
(44) [The speaker is composing a scene for a photograph:] I want the house [ﬁgure] to be behind Susan [ground]!
Figure-ground relations are found in other domains, including relations between events (Talmy 1978; Croft 2001, chapter 9). The main (ﬁgure)-subordinate (ground) event relation is construed asymmetrically in (45a), compared to the symmetrical coordinate event relation in (45b):
(45) a. I read while she sewed. b. I read and she sewed.
The event in the ground/subordinate clause is conceptualized as the basis or ground – i.e., a cause or precondition – for the event in the ﬁgure/main clause. Figure-ground asymmetry may lead to outright anomaly, as in example (46) (Talmy 2000:325):
(46) a. He dreamed while he slept. b. *He slept while he dreamed.
The two events could be coextensive, but since dreaming is contingent on sleeping, sleeping must function as the ground and therefore (46a) is acceptable while (46b) is not.
For most ﬁgure-ground subordinators, there is no natural inverse for the ﬁgureground relation speciﬁed by the subordinator (Talmy 2000:326):
(47) a. She slept until he arrived. b. ??He arrived ‘immediately-and-causally-before-the-end-of’ her sleeping.
(48) a. We stayed home because he had arrived. b. ??He arrived ‘to-the-occasioning-of-(the-decision-of)’ our staying home.
In a few cases, it is syntactically simple to construct both a semantic relation and its inverse, for example before and after. However, there is a difference in construal depending on the choice of event as ﬁgure ([49a–b], from Croft 2001:331):
(49) a. After Tom resigned, all hell broke loose. b. Tom resigned before all hell broke loose.
In (49a), Tom’s resignation is presumed to let loose the forces of chaos; whereas in (49b), Tom succeeded in cutting out when he saw what was happening (or perhaps before the consequences of his actions became apparent to everyone).

58 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
Similarly, simultaneous subordinators such as when are temporally symmetrical, but inappropriate choice of ﬁgure and ground events leads to conceptual peculiarity (compare [50b] to [50a], from Croft 2001:330):
(50) a. When Jerry was chair of the department, everything was all right. b. ??When everything was all right, Jerry was chair of the department.
In (50a), the healthy state of affairs is presumed to be due to Jerry’s chairmanship. Example (50b) on the other hand is odd, making Jerry look like an opportunist who has the extraordinary ability to take advantage of a healthy state of affairs to assume the chairmanship of the department.
Figure-ground alignment is an example of comparison in that the two elements of the scene are compared to each other; but unlike categorization and metaphor, the judgement is one of contrast rather than similarity. Langacker also explicitly links ﬁgure-ground to comparison, arguing that the typical ﬁgure-ground alignment falls out of his model of comparison as cognitive events of scanning a scene (Langacker 1987:121–22).5
3.4 Perspective/situatedness
Perspective, especially deixis, is perhaps the most obvious and most commented upon of the construal operations. Particularly for spatial descriptions, perspective is essential, and its dependence on the relative position and viewpoint of the speaker is well known. But perspective is also found in nonspatial domains: we have a perspective based on our knowledge, belief and attitudes as well as our spatiotemporal location. The closest cognitive property to perspective taken broadly is probably the philosophical notion of our situatedness in the world in a particular location – where location must be construed broadly to include temporal, epistemic and cultural context as well as spatial location. This broad interpretation of location is related to what the phenomenological philosopher Heidegger calls Being-in-the-world. Heidegger argues that Being-in-the-world is more than simple spatial inclusion; rather, it is the fundamental situatedness of existence in
5 Despite this, Langacker subsumes ﬁgure-ground under perspective among his focal adjustments. In fact, Langacker himself gives an argument to show that ﬁgure-ground alignment is conceptually independent of foreground-background perspective (see §3.4 below). Langacker also argues that ﬁgure-ground is conceptually distinct from focus of attention, which suggests that the ﬁgure-ground distinction does not belong under the general category of attention either (pace Talmy 1988a:195; Talmy does not include ﬁgure-ground in the schematic systems in Talmy 2000). Langacker makes greater use of the concepts trajector and landmark. A trajector is deﬁned as the ﬁgure in a relational proﬁle (Langacker 1987:217; see §3.5 for the deﬁnition of relationality); landmarks function as grounds to the trajector.

Conceptualization and construal operations 59
all respects (Heidegger 1927[1962]:79–80; cf. Dreyfus 1991:40–45). That is, we are always already in a situation and construing it from some perspective.
3.4.1 Viewpoint
It is easiest to begin illustrating perspectival construals with spatial examples. Langacker proposes viewpoint as a focal adjustment with two subtypes: vantage point and orientation (Langacker 1987:122–26). Vantage point was illustrated in (9a–b) in §3.1: the description of Timmy’s position as being in front of the tree or behind the tree depends on the vantage point of the speaker.6 A particular vantage point imposes a foreground-background alignment on a scene (ibid., 124–25).7 Alternative construals of Timmy’s position are achieved simply by the speaker moving to another position – that is, the linguistically expressed spatial relation is dependent on the speaker’s situatedness. Vantage point is sensitive to construal; in (51), it is the vantage point of the addressee (at the relevant future time) that is used to interpret behind:
(51) Follow my instructions carefully. Enter the woods by the south gate. Follow the path until you come to the big oak tree. You will ﬁnd the box behind it.
Orientation refers to the vertical dimension, deﬁned by a person’s canonical upright position. One example of orientation is the choice of above and below in (3a–b) in §3.1 (along with a switch in ﬁgure-ground alignment): the actual chimney-window orientation described in (3a–b) is relative to the canonical orientation of the speaker. Alternative construals for orientation are much rarer, since we rarely go around standing on our heads or hanging from our feet.
3.4.2 Deixis
Deixis is the phenomenon of using elements of the subject’s situatedness – more speciﬁcally, the subject qua speaker in a speech event – to designate something in the scene. Deixis has been widely studied (see, e.g., Levinson 1983, chapter 2), and we focus on deixis as construal here. Person deixis – the pronouns
6 This analysis applies only to the situational use of in front of/behind. In sentences such as (9a–b), the choice of preposition is determined purely situationally, by the relative positions of speaker, Timmy and tree. In a sentence such as The cat is in front of the house, there is available another interpretation in which the house has an inherent orientation such that the side with the main entrance is the front side, regardless of the speaker’s relative position. The remarks in this paragraph refer only to the purely situational interpretation.
7 A number of linguists have argued that clausal subordination represents a foreground-background distinction, but it appears to be better analyzed as a ﬁgure-ground distinction (Talmy 1978, 2000; Reinhart 1984; Croft 2001).

60 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
I, you, he/she/it, we and they – are only deﬁned relative to who is speaking, and this variation is an example of alternative construals deﬁned by the speech act situation (§2.1). Likewise, deictic demonstratives such as this and that, and deictic time reference such as present and past tense, are only deﬁned relative to the location and time of the speech event.
In addition to the relativity of spatiotemporal reference to the situation or perspective of the speech event, it is possible to construe another time and place as the deictic center. Examples (52a) and (52b) are construed with a deictic point of view at a place and time in the narrative; (52c) is bizarre because the point of view clashes with the reported information (Fillmore 1982b:262–63):
(52) a. He was coming up the steps. There was a broad smile on his face. b. He was going up the steps. There was a wad of bubblegum on the seat of his pants. c. He was coming up the steps. There was a wad of bubblegum on the seat of his pants.
Likewise, the use of the so-called narrative present in (53b), or the ‘sportcaster’s present’ in (54b), presents a construal of the time of the linguistic event, which has the effect of bringing the reported event conceptually closer to the listener (this construal also involves a ‘moving’ deictic center, moving with each reported event):
(53) a. He came up behind me, I stopped suddenly, and he rammed into me. b. He comes up behind me, I stop suddenly, and he rams into me.
(54) a. He hit the ball and the ﬁrst baseman missed it. b. He hits the ball – the ﬁrst baseman misses it . . .
In other words, deictic elements often display two layers of conceptualization: one relative to the situatedness of the speech act participants, and another construal that displaces the actual situatedness of the interlocutors to another time and place.
The situatedness of the speech act participants affects the structure of utterances in another, more profound way. The formulation of utterances is dependent on the shared knowledge, belief and attitudes of the interlocutors, what is often called the interlocutors’ common ground (e.g. Clark 1996; Langacker [1987:127] calls it the epistemic ground). As Clark points out in many different contexts, what we choose to express in utterances and how we express it is determined to a great extent by what we assume is or is not part of the common ground; the common ground provides us with an epistemic perspective situating the speaker and the hearer.
The simplest example of epistemic perspective is the use of the deﬁnite and indeﬁnite articles. Examples (55a–b) represent an alternative construal of what the

Conceptualization and construal operations 61
hearer knows:
(55) a. Did you see a hedgehog? b. Did you see the hedgehog?
Example (55a) construes the hedgehog as unknown to the hearer, while (55b) construes it as part of their common ground. The construal in (55b) could also be used in a context when the hearer in fact does not know about the hedgehog, as a way of surprising the hearer with the discovery by manipulating the epistemic deictic construal.
But in fact the wholesale structuring of clauses is determined by the epistemic perspective of common ground. This structuring often goes under the name of information structure or information packaging (Lambrecht 1994). Examples (6a–b) in §3.1 illustrate alternative construals of a scene based on a difference in information structure. The presentational sentence in (6a) (a subtype of what are also called thetic or sentence-focus structures; Lambrecht 1994:177) presents all of the information as part of the assertion directed to the hearer. The ordinary topic-comment (categorical or predicate-focus) sentence in (6b) presents the subject referent as part of a presupposition of current interest (and therefore part of the interlocutors’ common ground) and only the predicate as part of the assertion (Lambrecht 1994:121). In fact, information structure is one of the clearest syntactic examples of alternative construals of what is the same scene from a truth-conditional point of view.
Another example of perspectival construal that has been discussed more by pragmatically oriented linguists than by cognitive linguists is the notion of empathy (Kuno and Kaburaki 1977). By empathy, Kuno and Kaburaki mean the participant in the reported event whose perspective is taken by the speaker. Empathy is perspectival and as such is subject to alternative construals. Kuno and Kaburaki argue that empathy is involved in the semantics of a number of grammatical constructions. For example, the choice of describing Bill as John’s brother, that is, as a person anchored by his relation to John, instead of as Bill independent of John, implies that the speaker empathizes more with John than Bill. Likewise, choosing the passive Bill was hit by John, instead of the active John hit Bill, implies speaker empathy with the subject referent, namely Bill (compare [5a–b] in §3.1). Example (56c) is therefore odd compared to (56a–b), because of a clash in construed empathy: the speaker uses a description of Bill that implies empathy with John, combined with a grammatical voice that implies empathy with Bill (Kuno 1987:203–6):
(56) a. Then Johni hit hisi brother. b. Then Bill was hit by John/his brother. c. ??Then John’s brotheri was hit by himi.

62 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
Some linguists have argued that the distinction between the grammatical relations of subject and object is one of deixis or empathy. DeLancey (1981), in his analysis of split ergativity and subjecthood, argues that the unmarked subject category involves construing the orientation of the speaker towards the temporal and causal beginning of the event. On the other hand, Langacker (1991a:305– 17) deﬁnes subjecthood in terms of the most prominent ﬁgure, which combines the construal operations of attention (most prominent) and judgement (ﬁgure). Whichever is the correct analysis – and it is possible that different languages use different construals for subjecthood – the point is that fundamental grammatical categories such as subject, which are treated as ‘meaningless’ in some syntactic theories, represent a construal of the referent in the situation described by the utterance, and the construal analysis can predict patterns of (un)acceptability such as that found in (56a–c).
3.4.3 Subjectivity
The last construal operation under perspective in Table 3.1 is Langacker’s notion of subjectivity/objectivity. This refers to how one conceptualizes a scene that includes the speaker herself/himself. Two simple if restricted examples illustrate the alternative construals (Langacker 1987:131):
(57) [said by mother to child:] a. Don’t lie to me! b. Don’t lie to your mother!
Example (57a) represents the more common subjective construal of the speaker using a deictic personal pronoun, deﬁning her identity relative to the speech act situation. Example (57b) involves objectiﬁcation: the speaker describes herself in terms independent of the speech act situation.
It is also possible to subjectify reference to an entity (Langacker 1987:132):
(58) That’s me in the top row. [said when examining a photograph]
In (58), an entity that is not the speaker, namely the physical image in the photograph, is described using a deictic expression (me), as is in fact common in so-called picture noun contexts (see also §2.6). Another, more common example of subjectiﬁcation is the construal implied when using certain spatial expressions that can leave a ground object unexpressed (Langacker 1991b:326, 328):
(59) a. Vanessa is sitting across the table from Veronica. b. Vanessa is sitting across the table from me. c. Vanessa is sitting across the table.

Conceptualization and construal operations 63
Example (59c) is an instance of subjectiﬁcation of the across phrase: (59c) can only refer to the situation where Vanessa is sitting across the table from the speaker (unlike [59a]), yet explicit reference to the speech act participant is absent (unlike [59b]). Langacker argues that many grammatical expressions, and also the process of grammaticalization in language change, crucially involve subjectiﬁcation (Langacker 1991b, chapter 10; 1998); unfortunately, space prevents us from presenting Langacker’s analyses here.
Perspectival construals all result from our being in the world in a particular location and manner. From a purely bodily point of view, we are in a particular spatial location in the world (vantage point) and in a canonical upright orientation. From a communicative perspective, we are situated as participants in the speech event, which deﬁnes our spatial and temporal location and our roles in the speech event (deixis). Our roles in the speech event, however, also deﬁne the status of the situation to be communicated in speaking (epistemic deixis), our attitude towards it (empathy), and our presentation of ourselves in that situation (subjectivity).
3.5 Constitution/Gestalt
The construal operations to be described in this section represent the conceptualization of the very structure of the entities in a scene. These construal operations represent the most basic level of constituting experience and giving it structure or a Gestalt, as described by Gestalt psychologists (Koffka 1935; Wertheimer 1923[1950]) and phenomenologists such as Husserl (who uses the term ‘constitution’ in a similar context; see Husserl 1948[1973]). For example, many of the principles of Gestalt psychology such as proximity, bounding and good continuation are analyses of how human minds construe a single complex object from seemingly fragmented perceptual sensations. In cognitive linguistics, the most detailed discussion of constitutive construals is by Talmy, under his imaging systems of structural schematization (Talmy 1988a) and force dynamics (Talmy 1988b; both revised and expanded in Talmy 2000). In addition, most of the image schemas described by Lakoff, Johnson and Turner are construals of the structure of entities.
3.5.1 Structural schematization
Structural schematization describes the conceptualization of the topological, meronomic and geometrical structure of entities and their component parts. The subgrouping in Table 3.1 attempts to classify the wide range of structural schematizations (for a more complete inventory, see Talmy 2000:47–68). The ﬁrst

64 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
subgroup, individuation, includes whether or not entities are individuated (boundedness), and if so, their unity and relation to their parts, and their multiplicity if more than one individual is construed.
Such basic structural properties of entities are manifested in the choice of a count noun, mass noun or pluralia tanta form for nouns, and aspectual inﬂections for verbs. Even these properties are a matter of construal. For example, boundedness is not simply a spatial or material property. A person, star and island represent individuals bounded spatiotemporally; but a team, constellation and archipelago are also bounded entities (count nouns) where the speaker has construed them as whole units with distinct parts; even nothingness can be bounded as in hole or intermission (Langacker 1987:200–1).
In many cases there are alternative expressions for what appear to be the same entities that differ in their construal of structure (see especially Wierzbicka 1985). Examples (1a–b) in §3.1, the count noun leaves vs. the mass noun foliage, is one case. Foliage construes the entity as a relatively homogeneous substance, without clear boundaries (a mass of foliage can be borne on several trees). Leaf construes the entity as a bounded individual, which in turn is part of a single tree; leaves multiplies the individual, making it truth-conditionally comparable to foliage in the right contexts. Either construal is available through the lexicon of English. There is also a quantitative scalar adjustment involved: leaves evokes a more ﬁne-grained construal than foliage. Similarly, chocolate as a mass noun is a homogeneous, unbounded substance, while a chocolate is a bounded individual with internal structure, the characteristic construal of a count noun (conventionalized in this case; see [7a–b]). Again, the mass noun represents a more coarse-grained scalar adjustment. Countability also interacts with qualitative scalar adjustment: chair construes the entity as individuated and of a speciﬁc type; furniture construes it as an abstract mass along with tables, sofas, beds and so on in a coarse-grained schematization.
The bounded/unbounded structural schematization also applies to states and processes, as in (8a–b) from §3.1 (Croft 1998a, in prep.). The simple tense/aspect in Ira is a nuisance construes Ira’s behavior as a temporally unbounded behavioral trait of Ira that abstracts away from individual instances of nuisance behavior on Ira’s part. On the other hand, the progressive in Ira, stop being a nuisance! provides a ﬁner-grained scalar adjustment that construes an individual bounded action of Ira’s.
Image schemas such as containers or surfaces represent a construal of a more speciﬁc topological or geometric structure of objects. Herskovits 1986 provides a detailed and insightful construal analysis of geometric structure, only two examples from which can we present here. There are natural construals of objects that lend themselves to being containers or ﬂat objects, such as in the box or on the carpet;

Conceptualization and construal operations 65
but there are also many examples of alternative construals of objects (Herskovits 1986:76):
(60) a. There is milk in the bowl. b. There is dust on the bowl.
If there is a lot of dust or a few drops of milk, the actual spatial conﬁguration of ﬁgure and ground in (60a) and (60b) is not that much different. But since the function of bowls is to contain potable liquids, the bowl is construed as a container with in in (60a), and since dust is thought of as an extraneous substance, the bowl is construed as a surface with on in (60b).
The geometric construal of an object often requires selective attention (Herskovits 1986:65, 67):
(61) a. She is under the tree. b. The cat is under the table. c. One could see the shiny silver carp under the water.
In (61a), she is unlikely to be under the ground or inside the trunk (though such a construal is possible if, say, the suspect is leading the detective to the location of the body of the murder victim). The usual construal selects only the lower surface of the foliage as the underside of the object. In (61b), selection ignores the table legs, and scalar adjustment reduces the tabletop to a two-dimensional surface. In (61c), selection (driven by encyclopedic knowledge) proﬁles only the top surface of the water to specify the ﬁgure-ground relationship (and all of these examples are construed relative to the speaker’s canonical upright orientation, of course).
Another image schema that imposes a structure, this time more typically associated with properties, is the scale image schema, which provides a gradable dimension to a domain, which may or may not be measurable. The ways in which an entity is construed as possessing a scale or multiple scales are described in detail in §7.4. Here we simply note that the same domain may be construed with a scale (in contrast to a polar construal, as in [62a–b] and [63a–b]), or construed as calibratable, as in (64), a domain not usually considered measurable:
(62) a. Sally’s pregnant. b. Sally’s very pregnant.
(63) a. Here is a used washing machine. b. Let me offer you this slightly used washing machine for only $300!
(64) a. This Sauternes has a fragrant bouquet. b. The bouquet of the Fargues is twice as fragrant as that of the Climens.

66 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
3.5.2 Force dynamics
A second major category of constitutive construals is the force dynamic model of the conceptualization of events (Talmy 1976, 1988b, 2000). The force dynamic model is a generalization of the notion of causation, in which processes are conceptualized as involving different kinds of forces acting in different ways upon the participants of the event. The examples in (65) illustrate some of the force-dynamic patterns that Talmy analyzes:
(65) a. I kicked the ball. b. I held the ball. c. I dropped the ball.
Example (65a) represents the prototypical causative type: an antagonist (the causer) forces an agonist (the causee – the ball) that tends towards rest to move. Example (65b) extends the notion of causation to maintaining a rest state: the antagonist resists the agonist’s tendency to move. Example (65c) further extends to notion of causation to enablement: the antagonist acts in a way that allows the agonist to exert its tendency towards motion.
Croft (1991, 1998b, in prep.) argues that the force-dynamic structure of events largely determines the encoding of subject, object and oblique arguments of predicates. For instance, the choice of for in I baked brownies for Mary vs. with in I beat the eggs with a fork is determined by the fact that Mary is the endpoint, the beneﬁciary of the baking event, while the fork acts upon the eggs and is therefore an intermediate participant in the force-dynamic chain. The difference in degree of affectedness of chew the bone and chew on the bone in (11a–b) in §3.1 is a (conventionalized) consequence of the alternative construals of the degree of affectedness of the bone evoked by the object-oblique contrast.
Different choices of verbs, or different voice forms, or different argumentlinking constructions, express different conceptualizations of the force-dynamic structure of the event. For example, (66a) construes the situation as forcedynamically neutral (being a static situation), but (66b) construes the situation as having a force-dynamic value of resisting the effects of some (unspeciﬁed) force-applying process.
(66) a. The bowl was on the table. b. The bowl stayed on the table.
The alternative transitive and intransitive constructions in (67a–b) construe the event as externally caused or as self-contained (which allows [67b] to be used if no external agent or force is manifest as well as when the speaker wishes only to construe the event as such):

Conceptualization and construal operations 67
(67) a. She opened the door. b. The door opened.
Force and resistance play a role in the construal of semantic domains other than causation. For example, Talmy (1988b) and Sweetser (1990, chapter 3) argue that deontic modals such as may and must in (68a–b) construe the deontic modality as letting causation or the absence of resistance ([68a]; compare [65c]) vs. the application of force ([68b]; compare [65a]):
(68) a. You may leave. b. You must leave.
Sweetser extends this analysis metaphorically to the epistemic meanings of the modals in (69):
(69) a. She may be ill. b. She must be ill.
May in (69a) indicates the absence of resistance from concluding that the proposition She is ill is true, while must in (69b) forces one to the conclusion that She is ill is true.
3.5.3 Relationality (entity/interconnection)
Finally, an even more fundamental constitutive property of entities is subject to construal. Many semanticists distinguish between relational and nonrelational entities. A relational entity inherently implies the existence of another entity. For example, an adjectival concept such as ROUND cannot be conceived of without reference to something that is round, and a verbal concept such as RUN cannot be conceived of without reference to a runner. A nonrelational entity can be so conceived: for example, a nominal concept such as TABLE can be conceived of without reference to another entity.
Langacker argues that the difference between nouns (‘things’ in his conceptual terminology) and adjectives or verbs is that the latter are relational and the former are not (Langacker 1987:214–17). Thus, in Langacker’s conceptual scheme, verbs (‘processes’) are construed as relational and sequentially scanned (see §3.2); adjectives and other modiﬁers (‘atemporal relations’) are construed as relational but summarily scanned; and nouns (‘things’) are construed as nonrelational and summarily scanned.
Langacker’s deﬁnition of relationality rests on his deﬁnition of things/nounhood. He argues that nounhood construes a concept as a region or ‘set of interconnected entities’ (Langacker 1987:198); entities are nonrelational. Contrasting

68 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
nonrelational things with relational concepts, Langacker describes a relational concept as proﬁling the interconnections between entities while a noun proﬁles the entities that are interconnected (ibid., 216). For example, one can think of the (nonrelational) noun circle as proﬁling the points (entities) that make up the circle, while the (relational) adjective round proﬁles the interconnections that deﬁne the circle’s curvature.
Langacker’s deﬁnition of relational vs. nonrelational suggests that a construal as an entity (or set of entities) is a better deﬁnition of nounhood than functioning as a region. A verbal or adjectival concept such as round involves a region also, but proﬁles its interconnections instead of its entities. Moreover, Langacker’s example of circle vs. round also reveals that entity and interconnection are not givens, but instead involve conceptualization. The noun roundness does not proﬁle the points/entities making up a round thing; it does not mean the same thing as circle, or even round object. Instead, roundness construes the shape as an entity, rather than as interconnections as the adjective round does. In fact, Langacker notes that anything can be construed as an entity, including interconnections (ibid., 198). Conversely, a predicate nominal construction like be a circle – which in many other languages is simply the word ‘circle’ inﬂected more or less like a verbal predicate – construes the set of entities as an interconnection, namely the relation of being an instance of the type deﬁned by the noun (Croft 1991:69–70).
Examples (10a–b) in §3.1 illustrate the entity-interconnection construal. Jill is fussy construes the trait as relational, and thus introduces a degree of separation between the behavioral trait and the person (expressed as subject). Be a fussbudget construes the trait as nonrelational, and therefore saying that Jill is a fussbudget can only be construed as membership of a category of persons who are deﬁned by this behavioral trait. Hence (10b) makes out Jill as a more problematic child than does (10a).
Constitutive construal operations are somewhat different from the construal operations resulting from the cognitive abilities of attention, comparison and perspective. Constitutive construal operations provide a structure to the experience being communicated. As such, they are not unlike domains, as has been noted for image schemas, most of which are constitutive construal operations (Clausner and Croft 1999:16–25). There are many words denoting concepts that must be proﬁled in an image-schematic domain, such as more, very, in, part, alike, force (see §2.2; in fact, such words make up Parts I and II of Roget’s Thesaurus). Image schemas also have a complex internal structure, like domains:
. . . image schematic gestalts have considerable internal structure – they are not undifferentiated. On the contrary, it is the organization of their structure that makes them experientially basic meaningful patterns in our experience and

Conceptualization and construal operations 69
understanding. The schema for these gestalts have parts and dimensions that stand in various relationships that allow us to make sense of our experience. (Johnson 1987:61)
Johnson notes that many image schemas are experienced together and describes this as a superposition of schemas, using the example of things we co-experience as both near us and central to our vantage point vs. things far away and peripheral: ‘The center-periphery schema is almost never experienced in an isolated or self-contained fashion . . . Given a center and a periphery, we will also experience the near-far schema as stretching along our perceptual or conceptual perspective’ (Johnson 1987:125). The superimposition of image schemas is identical to the combination of domains in a domain matrix. In fact, image-schematic domains are usually combined in a matrix with ordinary domains. For example, our experience of degrees of weight combines the SCALE image schema(tic domain) with another basic domain, WEIGHT. It is very difﬁcult to separate WEIGHT and SCALE, but in this respect, WEIGHT and SCALE represent the tightest relationship between domains in a domain matrix, that is, what Langacker describes as dimensions of a domain (see §2.4).
The analysis of (constitutive) image schemas as image-schematic domains is not incompatible with their function as construal operations, because domains themselves are construals, framing the experience to be communicated in a certain way. What makes image schemas worthy of separate treatment here is their pervasiveness in experience: to be communicated, our experience must be construed in terms of basic structure, scales and force dynamics.
3.6 Conclusion
As the preceding discussion demonstrates, any sentence involves a myriad of construals of the experience to be communicated. Everything from the choice of words and their part of speech to the various inﬂections and constructions that make up the grammatical structure of an utterance involves conceptualization. Even fundamental conceptual properties such as the categorization of experiences and their basic structure is subject to construal. This fact raises two questions, one more technical and one more philosophical.
The more technical question is: how do the construal operations interact? Two general observations can be made about the interaction of construal operations. The ﬁrst is that construal operations can be nested or iterated (Talmy 2000: 84– 88; Herskovits 1986:57–59; Langacker 1987:138–46). Talmy illustrates nesting with the examples of a gradually built up set of structural schematizations in (70)

70 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
(Talmy 2000:84):
(70) a. The beacon ﬂashed (as I glanced over). b. The beacon kept ﬂashing. c. The beacon ﬂashed ﬁve times in a row. d. The beacon kept ﬂashing ﬁve times at a stretch. e. The beacon ﬂashed ﬁve times at a stretch for three hours.
In (70a), ﬂash is construed as a single individuated event. In (70b), the event is construed as iterated. In (70c), the iterated event is bounded by the number of iterations; (70d) iterates the bounded iterated event of (70c), and (70e) bounds the iterated complex event of (70d).
Herskovits represents nested geometric construal operations as semantic functions, as in (71) (Herskovits 1986:59–60):
(71) a. The bird is in the bush. b. Included(Part(Place(Bird)), Interior(Outline(VisiblePart(Place (Bush)))))
The formula in (71b) describes the most natural construal of (71a): a scene in which (at least) part of the spatial region occupied by the bird is included – the meaning of in – in the interior space deﬁned by the outline of the visible part of the spatial region occupied by the bush.
The second general observation is that the layers of construal operations must yield a conceptually uniﬁed construal of the meaning of the utterance (Croft 1993[2002]:163, 194–99). Croft argues that all of the concepts in a single clause must be construed as part of a single uniﬁed domain.8 Examples (72)–(73), for example, must be construed wholly in the domain of emotion and semantic content respectively; this requires a metaphorical construal of the spatial preposition in in (72) and a metonymic construal of the human proper name Proust in (73) (ibid., 195):
(72) She’s in a good mood. (73) Proust is tough to read.
In (72)–(73), the alternative construal of one word in the clause (in, Proust) is driven by the normal or ‘literal’ construal of another word or phrase in the clause (mood, read). However, all that matters is that the entire clause is construed in a single domain. It is possible that alternative construals are available for the entire
8 In the original 1993 paper, Croft argues that only immediate clause dependents must be conceptually uniﬁed; the internal structure of argument phrases may be uniﬁed around a different domain. Nunberg’s analysis of metonymy suggests that even argument phrases must conform to the unity of domain (Nunberg 1995; see also §3.2.1).

Conceptualization and construal operations 71
clause, leading to ambiguity as in (74), or a construal that is outside the ‘literal’ meanings of any of the words, as in (75) (Croft 1993[2002]:198, 199):
(74) This book is heavy. (physically weighty or emotionally powerful) (75) The newspaper went under. (construed in the domain of business activity)
The conceptual unity of domain is only one of three conceptual unities that a clause must obey. The referents in a clause must be construed as belonging to a single place and time in a mental space (Fauconnier 1985; Croft 1993[2002]:200). Thus in (76), the hearer must construe the referent of her sister to exist in Margaret’s belief space (whether or not Margaret has a sister in reality, or whether or not the description her sister applies to the referent in Margaret’s belief space), and must construe the referent of a car to exist in the same space (again, whether or not a speciﬁc car ﬁtting the description exists in reality):
(76) Margaret believes that her sister bought a car.
The referents in a clause must also conform to a single instantiation of the event plus participants (Croft 1993[2002]:201). This unity of selection accounts for the interaction between verbal aspect, noun countability and adverbial construals, as in (77)–(78):
(77) a. Sally drinks wine. b. Sally spilled wine on the carpet.
(78) a. Dan wrote the letters in two hours. b. Dan wrote letters for two hours.
In (77a), the situation is construed as generic (hence unbounded and not referring to a speciﬁc event); so wine must be construed as referring to the type. In (77b), the situation is construed as speciﬁc and bounded, so wine must be construed as referring to a speciﬁc bounded amount of the liquid. In (78a), the situation is construed as bounded by the deﬁnite noun phrase and the compatible adverbial phrase in two hours; so write is construed as bounded (telic). In (78b), the situation is construed as unbounded and speciﬁc by the adverbial phrase for two hours, so the unbounded bare plural letters is construed as speciﬁc (not generic as in I hate to write letters), and write is construed as speciﬁc and unbounded.
The more philosophical question that construal raises is, what is the relationship between language, thought and experience? Are there any constraints on the relationship, and in which direction do the constraints operate: from language to thought to experience, or the reverse direction, or both?
In a number of places in this chapter, we have referred to the typical construal of a particular experience: for example, pregnancy is typically construed as not gradable, a smaller, movable object is typically construed as ﬁgure, an action is

72 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
typically scanned sequentially, and so on. The nature of our experience in many instances favors certain construals over others. It is these widespread typical or default construals that have led semanticists to posit a more rigid model of the mapping from linguistic meaning to experience. Cognitive linguists emphasize that ﬂexibility is necessary for understanding conceptualization, and this ﬂexibility is due to the nature of the human mind as it engages with the world. But experience does constrain human conceptualization to some degree, rendering some construals difﬁcult and others almost impossible.
It appears that the pervasive role of conceptualization in linguistic expression entails a relativistic approach to the relation between language and thought: the way we conceive our experience is determined by the grammatical structure of our language. This strongly relativistic formulation is not generally found in cognitive linguistics, however.
Langacker argues that language-speciﬁc semantic structure must be distinguished from a universal conceptual structure (Langacker 1976). Langacker rejects the claim that ‘semantic structure can, in some unclear but hopefully straightforward way, be related directly to thought and cognition, i.e. the structures manipulated in cognition are essentially the same as the semantic structures underlying sentences’ (ibid.). In discussing an example from Whorf, who compares the English He invites people for a feast to its nearest Nootka equivalent, which literally translates into something like ‘He goes for eaters of cooked (food)’ (ibid., 342–44), Langacker suggests that both could be expressing the same cognitive experience, but employ different semantic structures to express the experience. As Lakoff puts it, ‘experience does not determine conceptual systems, [it] only motivates them’ (Lakoff 1987:310).
Langacker calls language-speciﬁc semantic structures conventional imagery. The semantic representations of Cognitive Grammar, many examples of which have been used in this chapter, are intended to describe this conventional imagery, not the presumably universal cognitive structures that these conventional images construe. Langacker uses the example of the expression of bodily states (Langacker 1976:345) to illustrate his approach: English speakers say ‘I am cold’, whereas French speakers say literally ‘I have cold’ and Modern Hebrew speakers say ‘It is cold to me.’ In Langacker’s view, ‘these expressions differ semantically even though they refer to the same experience, for they employ different images to structure the same basic conceptual content’ (Langacker 1987:47).
The question remains as to the status of these conventional images in thought. Langacker suggests that it is relatively ephemeral:
When we use a particular construction or grammatical morpheme, we thereby select a particular image to structure the conceived situation for communicative

Conceptualization and construal operations 73
purposes. Because languages differ in their grammatical structure, they differ in the imagery that speakers employ when conforming to linguistic convention. The relativistic view does not per se imply that lexicogrammatical structure imposes any signiﬁcant constraints on our thought process – in fact I suspect it to be rather superﬁcial (cf. Langacker 1976). The symbolic resources of a language generally provide an array of alternative images for describing a given scene, and we shift from one to another with great facility, often within the conﬁnes of a single sentence. The conventional imagery invoked for linguistic expression is a ﬂeeting thing that neither deﬁnes nor constrains the contents of our thoughts (Langacker 1991b:12).
Slobin (1991) suggests a somewhat similar view, which he describes as ‘thinking for speaking’: the conceptualization of experience found in grammar is relevant for communication, but not necessarily relevant for other cognitive activities.
However, not all construals are conventional; there are many cases of novel language use that will represent novel construals, and all conventional construals began as novel. Even some conventional construals are still perceived as ‘loaded.’ Croft (2001, chapter 3) suggests a stronger role for active construal which he calls the conventional universalist position. When a grammatical structure is used for the ﬁrst time (or the ﬁrst few times) to construe an experience, it does inﬂuence the way speakers think of that experience. But as the extension of that grammatical expression to the new experience becomes conventionalized – that is, it becomes the normal or even the only way to talk about the experience – then the original construal no longer constrains how speakers think of that experience. Evidence for the conventional universalist position includes the fact that the extended construction displays grammatical behavior incompatible with the original construal but applicable to the experience being communicated. For example, in French the expression of bodily states is construed as possession; compare (79a) to (79b):
(79) a. J’ai froid. ‘I am cold’ [lit. ‘I have cold’] b. J’ai une voiture. ‘I have a car.’
But bodily states can be construed as gradable, which is incompatible with possession (Croft 2001:115):
(80) a. J’ai tre`s froid. ‘I am very cold’ [lit. ‘I have very cold’] b. *J’ai tre`s une voiture. [lit. ‘I have very a car’]
Construal is a central aspect of language and its relation to thought; but it is constrained by convention as well as by the experience itself. This hypothesis guides the approach to categorization in the next chapter.

Categories, concepts and meanings
4.1 Introduction
The act of categorization is one of the most basic human cognitive activities. Categorization involves the apprehension of some individual entity, some particular of experience, as an instance of something conceived more abstractly that also encompasses other actual and potential instantiations. For instance, a speciﬁc animal can be construed as an instantiation of the species DOG, a speciﬁc patch of color as a manifestation of the property RED, and so on. We shall call this abstract mental construct a conceptual category. Conceptual categories can be regarded as cognitive tools, and are usually credited with a number of general functions:
(a) Learning. Experiences never recur exactly: our ability to learn from past experience would be severely impaired if we could not relate the present to similar aspects of past experience, that is, by putting them into the same conceptual categories.
(b) Planning. The formulation of goals and plans to achieve them also requires knowledge to be disassociated from individuals and packaged into concepts characterizing categories of entities.
(c) Communication. Language works in terms of generalities, that is, in terms of categories. Any linguistic expression, however detailed, in the end represents only a category of referents.
(d) Economy. Knowledge does not (all) need to be related to individual members: a signiﬁcant amount can be stored in relation to groups of individuals. New knowledge gained on the basis of interaction with one or more individuals can be easily generalized to other members of category. Conversely, knowing, on the basis of a limited number of criteria, that an individual belongs to a particular category, can give access to a much wider range of information about that individual.
There is an important distinction to be made between generic concepts like CAT and TERRORIST, and individual concepts like TONY BLAIR and CLEOPATRA. The process of categorization presupposes a more basic one, namely, that of
74

Categories, concepts and meanings 75
classifying particular experiences as experiences of one and the same individual entity. In both cases a Gestalt is formed, but they are different sorts of Gestalt. Both are construals, in our sense. An adult human has knowledge about thousands of individual items, not just persons, but also objects, places and so on. A large proportion of things communicated about and consciously entertained are individual in nature: consciousness is largely inhabited by individuals. Generic concepts mostly function to identify and/or characterize individuals. A particular individual concept is also a bundle of knowledge, perhaps very rich, perhaps sketchy in the extreme. An individual concept is not itself a ﬁnal construal, as it is capable of almost unlimited modulation, particularly via the descriptive content of deﬁnite referring expressions (e.g. that shifty-looking character standing beside the piano). Such content has a dual function: it contributes to the narrowing down of the search space in which the referent is located, and it modulates the eventual construal of the individual concept. Most experimental work and theorizing, both in cognitive psychology and cognitive linguistics, has been concerned with generic concepts rather than individual concepts.
Conceptual categories can be viewed from several different perspectives, which, although connected, should be clearly distinguished. We shall be mainly concerned with three of these. Firstly, conceptual categories can be viewed as collections of individuals. The properties of collections are distinct from the properties of the individuals that constitute them. The two properties that will concern us most are, ﬁrst, category boundaries, and second, graded centrality, that is, the fact that a category typically has a core tapering to a periphery. Secondly, we can look at a conceptual category from the point of view of the individuals that make up the category: how can we characterize them, and how can we distinguish them from members of other categories? Thirdly, there is the question of the level of categorization. This is partly a matter of inclusiveness – some categories include others as subcategories – and hence is a relative property, but as we shall see, there are grounds for proposing absolute levels with deﬁnable characteristics. We shall treat level of categorization as being determined by the type and quantity of information in the characterization of members of the category.
The view of conceptual categories as ﬁxed cognitive entities with stable associations with linguistic expressions has been, and still is, the dominant one in cognitive psychology and linguistics. However, more recently, a dynamic picture of concepts is emerging, in which they are viewed as being created at the moment of use. On this view, all aspects of conceptual categories are subject to construal. This is the view that will be adopted in this book, alongside a parallel view of word meaning. Before expounding the dynamic construal approach, we ﬁrst survey the theories of conceptual structure that have had the greatest inﬂuence on the development of cognitive linguistics.

4.2 The classical model of category structure
The so-called classical model of conceptual categories deﬁnes them in terms of a set of necessary and sufﬁcient features. The features are necessary in that no entity that does not possess the full set is a member of the category, and they are sufﬁcient in that possession of all the features guarantees membership. Thus, the category COLT may be deﬁned by the features [EQUINE], [MALE], [YOUNG]. This basic idea is of great antiquity, but the immediate inspiration for its adoption by psychologists such as Collins and Quillian (1969) was its use in structuralist semantics, and later by Katz and Fodor (1963). In the Katz and Fodor system, some features were binary and others not. Binary features had only two values, present or absent. For instance, the deﬁnition of FILLY would differ from that of COLT in the value of the feature denoting sex: COLT would be [EQUINE], [MALE+], [ADULT−], whereas FILLY would be [EQUINE], [MALE−], [ADULT−]; MARE would be deﬁned by the features [EQUINE], [MALE−], [ADULT+], and STALLION by [EQUINE], [MALE+], [ADULT+]. Non-binary features such as [EQUINE] belonged to sets of ‘antonymous n-tuples,’ only one of which may be present in any individual (that is to say, a combination of features such as [EQUINE], [CANINE], [FELINE] would be impossible). This picture of category structure is typically accompanied by the ‘nesting assumption’ (Hahn and Chater 1997:47), which states that a subordinate concept, such as ROBIN, contains as part of its deﬁnition the features deﬁning a superordinate concept such as BIRD (in construction grammar, this is called ‘inheritance’ – see §10.2.1). Collins and Quillian (1969) incorporated the feature deﬁnition of concepts, together with the nesting assumption, in their proposal for a hierarchical model of semantic memory.
The classical model establishes a clear and rigid boundary to a category. Inclusion relations between categories are also captured, but no account is possible of absolute levels of categorization (see below). It is important to note that a classical deﬁnition of an entity is not a full description of it or its place in the world: one has only to think of one’s experience and knowledge of, say, a kitten, in comparison with the deﬁnition [FELINE][DOMESTIC+][ADULT−].
The difﬁculties faced by the classical model of conceptual categories are many. Three frequently cited shortcomings have provided the major motivation for the development of alternative theories. Firstly, for many everyday concepts, as Wittgenstein pointed out with his well-known example of GAME, adequate deﬁnitions in terms of necessary and sufﬁcient features are simply not available. Furthermore, as Fillmore (1975) pointed out in connection with the noun bachelor, even for those concepts that seem to have deﬁnitions, the deﬁnitions typically hold only within a speciﬁc domain (see discussion of bachelor in §2.5). Secondly,

Categories, concepts and meanings 77
what is here called ‘graded centrality’ constitutes a problem; that is, the fact that some members of a category are judged ‘better’, or ‘more representative’ of the category than others: in a classical category, all members are equal. Thirdly, the classical model can offer no account of why category boundaries, in practice, seem to be vague and variable (they are frequently described as ‘fuzzy’, but our account will be somewhat different). A model of category structure is supposed to provide a basis for an account of how we use categories in remembering, planning, reasoning and so on. A classical deﬁnition is not a very efﬁcient vehicle for this purpose, because the information it contains is too sparse.
Several theories of the nature of natural categories have been proposed, mostly in the psychological literature, but the theory that has had the most inﬂuence on the development of cognitive linguistics is undoubtedly prototype theory, to which we now turn.
4.3 The prototype model of category structure
The pioneering experimental and theoretical work on prototype theory was carried out by Rosch and her co-workers (see Rosch 1973, 1978; Rosch and Mervis 1975), although this built on earlier insights, notably Wittgenstein 1953 and Brown 1958.
4.3.1 Graded centrality
Not all members of a category have the same status within the category. People have intuitions that some category members are better examples of the category than others. Members that are judged to be the best examples of a category can be considered to be the most central in the category. There has been a considerable amount of experimental work by cognitive psychologists on the notion of Goodness-Of-Exemplar (henceforward GOE). The most basic experimental procedure is simply to present subjects with a category and a list of putative members of the category and to ask them to assign to each member a numerical score from 1 to 7 according to how good an example it is, with 1 designating a very good example, and 7 a very poor example or not an example at all. Subjects reportedly have no difﬁculty grasping what is required of them. Furthermore, provided the subjects are drawn from a more-or-less uniform speech community, the results cluster strongly around particular values (in other words, subjects are not responding at random). Combining the results from a large number of subjects allows the identiﬁcation of the best examples of categories: these are typically referred to as the prototypes or prototypical members of the category. So, for

78 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
instance, if the category was VEGETABLE, the ratings of various items (by British subjects) might be as follows (these scores represent the ratings of one of the authors):

LEEK, CARROT BROCCOLI, PARSNIP CELERY, BEETROOT AUBERGINE, COURGETTE PARSLEY, BASIL RHUBARB LEMON

GOE rating 1 2 3 4 5 6 7

GOE ratings may be strongly culture dependent. (Familiarity is undoubtedly a factor inﬂuencing GOE scores, but the scores cannot be reduced to familiarity.) For instance, in a British context (say, a typical class of undergraduates), DATE typically receives a GOE score of 3–5 relative to the category of FRUIT, but an audience of Jordanians accorded it an almost unanimous 1.
The signiﬁcance of GOE scores is enhanced by experiments showing that they correlate to a signiﬁcant degree with a number of independent properties. The following is a selection of these properties (‘a high GOE score’ means one that is close to 1).
(i) Frequency and order of mention. When subjects are asked to list as many examples of a given category as possible, usually within a time limit, the overall frequency of mention of an item shows a strong correlation with its GOE score, while the average position of an item in lists correlates inversely with GOE.
(ii) Order of learning. By and large, children learn prototypical members of categories before more peripheral members. (This may, however, simply be a function of the frequency of words addressed to them.)
(iii) Family resemblance. Items with a high GOE rating have a higher degree of family resemblance (measured by sharing of features) to other category members than items with low GOE ratings, and a lower degree of resemblance to members of other categories.
(iv) Veriﬁcation speed. In typical experiments, subjects see two words ﬂashed onto a screen. Their task is to answer as quickly as possible ‘Yes’ if the second word denotes a member of the category designated by the ﬁrst word, and ‘No’ if it does not (e.g. VEGETABLE: CARROT, VEHICLE: CHAIR). The subjects’ speed of response is measured. It is found that responses are faster to items with a higher GOE score.
(v) Priming. Priming experiments frequently use the lexical decision task: subjects are presented with a string of letters and have to say as quickly as possible

Categories, concepts and meanings 79
whether or not the string forms a word. Presenting a semantically related word, or the same word, before a test item has the effect of speeding up subjects’ responses: this phenomenon is known as priming. The relevant case here is when the prime is a category name, like FRUIT. The degree of speeding up is the priming effect. The priming effect correlates with the GOE score of the category member, that is, for Britons, FRUIT will speed up the response to APPLE to a greater degree than the response to, for instance, DATE.
Psycholinguistic variables such as veriﬁcation speed and priming are regarded as particularly signiﬁcant correlates of GOE because they are not under conscious control and therefore can be claimed to reveal underlying properties of categories.
There has been some dispute in the literature regarding the relationship between the GOE of an item and its degree of membership (henceforward DOM) in the category. Some say that, in giving GOE scores, subjects are in fact giving DOM scores. However, this is misleading. What they were asked to do was to rate items as to how good they were as members of particular categories. Saying that they were giving DOM ratings is a subsequent interpretation. Those who object to the equation of GOE and DOM (for instance, Lakoff [1987:45], Pulman [1983], Cruse [1992b]), point to examples like OSTRICH in the category BIRD. There is no doubt, they say, that an ostrich is a fully paid-up member of the BIRD category, but also undeniably has a low GOE, hence the two parameters must be independent. Ungerer and Schmid (1996) claim not to see a problem, but they do not throw any light on the matter. Taylor (1989[1997]) claims that both assessments of OSTRICH are DOM judgements, but they are made with respect to differently construed categories. An ostrich is judged a full member relative to an ‘expert’ category, which has clear membership criteria; the graded membership judgement is made relative to the everyday category BIRD, which does not have clear membership criteria. This is ingenious, and we are sympathetic to the appeal to different construals of categories denoted by the same lexical item, but Taylor’s account does not stand up to close scrutiny.
The ﬁrst point to make is that yes/no judgements and graded judgements coexist as alternative construals in many semantic domains. Take, for example, the case of dead and alive. The domain of what might be called ‘vital status’ is often construed dichotomously: saying John is dead normally commits one to the truth of John is not alive. But it also possible to say John is more alive than Mary. This does not change the domain, but reconstrues it as a gradable scale. The same is true of category membership. In the case of BIRD (whether construed as an expert category or an everyday one), anything on the right side of the boundary is in the category, but at the same time, variable centrality allows a gradable construal of some things as more in the category than others, hence there is some legitimacy in interpreting GOE as DOM.

80 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
At the same time, there is something counterintuitive about saying that an ostrich is, say, only 30% a bird, and perhaps the term DOM should be reserved for a distinctive property. We may think of a category as a container (i.e., a result of the imposition of the Lakofﬁan CONTAINER image-schema on a domain). What would we normally understand by a description of an object as 30% in a container? Surely something like a teddy bear that is partly in and partly out of the toy box, rather than one that is nearer the side of the box than the middle? There is a category equivalent of this picture. When we say that, for instance, a priest is to some extent a social worker, we are effectively placing him part-in, part-out of the category (cf. Lakoff 1973). That is to say, we are construing the categories PRIEST and SOCIAL WORKER as partially overlapping. This is surely a more useful conception of DOM. (NB: the view expressed here regarding DOM is signiﬁcantly different from that in Cruse 1992.)
Two problems may be signaled here in connection with GOE experiments and results. One concerns the meaning attributed, in the context of the experiments, to expressions such as How good is X as an example of category Y? How, exactly, is How good? interpreted? Used in actual contexts, good and better do not normally give rise to communicative problems. For instance, the goodness of a dog, if thought of as a pet for a young child, is different from what it would be if it was thought of as providing security for a house, or as contributing to the life of a farm. This does not destroy the notion of GOE, but suggests that truly signiﬁcant results would require speciﬁc construals of both the categories being judged and the meaning of good. Various at least partially distinct notions of goodness can be teased out (see, for instance, Lakoff 1987:84–90). The following are the main types:
(i) Typicality/representativeness. This indicates how accurate/useful an idea of a category one would get from familiarity with only one subcategory. This dimension has a clear relation to frequency. Lakoff points out that we are much more likely to generalize properties from typical to non-typical members than vice versa. In certain cases, a known individual member may be assumed to be typical of a class (for instance, if a person has limited experience of the class).
(ii) Closeness to an ideal. This is related to what in Cruse 1990 was called ‘quality.’ The example given there was that of emeralds. The most highly valued emeralds have a deep, intense color, and are without ﬂaws; but these are also the most rare (and the bigger, the rarer), so they are in no way typical. As Lakoff points out, ideals operate in many domains. They may be represented by a set of abstract properties, as in the case of emeralds, or they may be centered around an individual (called by Lakoff a ‘paragon’).
(iii) Stereotypicality. This is interestingly different from typicality, but a fully convincing explanation of the difference is not yet available. Lakoff’s account

Categories, concepts and meanings 81
(1987:85–6) is suggestive, but not fully explanatory. Lakoff says that the use of typicality is usually unconscious and automatic, whereas the use of stereotypes is conscious: this is plausible. He also says that stereotypes change, but typicality is constant over a person’s lifetime. However, typicality changes as reality changes (think of a typical car or computer or camera), whereas a stereotype can persist in the face of change. Stereotypes are also typically associated with evaluative features.
There is another problem. A lot of the classical experiments deal with subcategories as category members, rather than individuals: for example, subjects are given a category such as FRUIT, and a range of fruit types such as APPLE, STRAWBERRY, MANGO, PASSION FRUIT, DATE, OLIVE and so on for GOE scoring. Other experiments involve individuals: for instance, the work on prototypical colors by Rosch (Heider 1971, 1972, and Berlin and Kay 1969) and others; also experiments with young children typically use individual items, not category names. It does make a difference. Using categories as examples of other categories suppresses properties that can enter into the notion of goodness. This is true of quality as described above. Another example is the property of well-formedness: it is all very well saying that an apple is the best example of a fruit, but what if it is a rotten apple? As far as individuals are concerned, well-formedness is yet another variety of goodness.
4.3.2 The representation of conceptual categories
Prototype theory comes in two main versions (according to the psychologist Hampton 1997). In both versions, the linked notions of graded centrality and best examples occupy a central place. (Linguists tend not to distinguish clearly between the two versions.) One version represents a concept in terms of a list of the attributes of category members. This resembles a classical deﬁnition except that the features of a prototype representation are not required to be necessary and sufﬁcient (although neither of these is necessarily ruled out for individual features). The centrality of an item in the category depends on how many of the relevant set of features it possesses: the more it possesses, the better an example of the category it will be. A feature is justiﬁed if, other things being equal, its presence leads to a higher GOE rating. In some versions, features can be weighted according to their contribution to centrality, and such versions will set an overall weighting score as a qualiﬁcation for category membership. It is possible that no existing member of a category possesses all the prototype features. In such a case, the core of the category is represented by the member or members with the highest feature count (the actual prototype will then be an idealization represented by the full set of features).

82 A conceptual approach to linguistic analysis
Another version of prototype theory depends on the notion of similarity. A concept can be thought of as represented by an ideal exemplar, and membership and centrality of other items can be deﬁned in terms of their similarity to the prototype. Hampton emphasizes that the two versions of prototype theory are not equivalent. Simple concepts, such as those involving color or shape, for instance, are better served by the similarity approach, whereas complex concepts, such as BIRD or VEHICLE, can best be handled by the feature-list model (see Hampton 1997:88). The feature-list version of prototype theory accounts for Wittgensteinian categories such as GAME, for which there is no deﬁnition in terms of necessary and sufﬁcient features, but which show family resemblance relations. The fact that there are no necessary and sufﬁcient features is also consistent with the fact that when subjects are asked to supply attributes that characterize a category, they do not conﬁne themselves to attributes possessed by all members of the category, but also give features that a signiﬁcant majority possess. Hampton says that both versions of the theory give a satisfactory account of the existence of borderline cases. However, it is difﬁcult to see why a system where category membership depends on the presence of X features out of a list of Y will generate more borderline instances than one where membership depends on the presence of Y features out of a list of Y. On the other hand, one can see how a similarity-based system will throw up borderline cases, especially if the similarity dimensions vary continuously.

4.3.3 Levels of categorization
Prototype theory also provides an account of levels of categorization. Categories occur at different levels of inclusiveness, with more speciﬁc ones nested within more inclusive ones:

(1)

a. vehicle – car – hatchback

b. fruit – apple – Granny Smith

c. living thing – creature – animal – dog – spaniel

d. object – implement – cutlery – knife – bread knife

e. object – item of furniture – table – card table

Normally, one level of speciﬁcity in each set, called the basic (Rosch et al. 1976) or generic (Berlin et al. 1973) level of speciﬁcity, has a special status, and importance. (The basic level items in [1] are printed in bold italic.) Apart from the basic level, two further levels of speciﬁcity with different characteristics are usually identiﬁed: superordinate level and subordinate level. These are not deﬁned simply by their position in the chain – there are substantive characteristics that distinguish one level from another. (For an extended discussion of hierarchical structure in concepts, see Murphy and Lassaline 1997.)
