Martin Thiering SPATIAL SEMIOTICS AND SPATIAL MENTAL MODELS

This book presents novel data from endangered languages and cultures that are ever so often still not focused on. It combines different disciplines to capture the intricacies of spatial orientation and navigation. Also, the interplay between culture through language and practices presents new insights in the importance of combining cognitive semantics with cognitive anthropology. Hence, data is presented indicating the constructive process of figure-ground asymmetries upon shaping of spatial categorization.
THE SERIES: APPLICATIONS OF COGNITIVE LINGUISTICS (ACL) The series welcomes book proposals from any domain where the theoretical insights developed in Cognitive Linguistics (CL) have been fruitfully applied. Researchers in different academic fields apply the CL theoretical framework to the investigation of linguistic issues in their particular disciplines. The primary focus of ACL is to serve as a high level forum for the result of these investigations.

This book is the result of many years of research and struggles with different subjects and topics on spatial relations in cognitive semantics and related fields. The general idea of summarizing different research results in a monograph was born in 2013 at the 12th International Cognitive Linguistic Conference (ICLC) at the University of Alberta, my alma mater in Canada. First and foremost I am happy to thank Gitte Kristiansen, editor of the Applied Cognitive Linguistic series at de Gruyter Mouton, who at the ICLC invited me to submit a book proposal. De Gruyter Mouton helped with formal issues and keeping to deadlines, especially Birgit Sievert, Julie Miess and Jens Lindenhain. James Conway did an incredible job editing the whole manuscript, pointing out not only formal and stylistic issues, but also making corrections in the overall structure. The various companies who issued the previously published chapters kindly allowed revision and reuse of the respective contributions to form a new, novel and cohesive book on different spatial issues.
I would also like to thank the anonymous reviewer who synthesized the gist of the book by calling it a “cultural-cognitive view of language”. I could not have said it better. Thanks also to Alan Cienki and Raphael Berthele who read the initial introduction and theory chapter and provided very helpful feedback.
This book is a highly revised version of my habilitation treatise which was supervised by Monika Schwarz-Friesel at the Technical University Berlin. I am very grateful that she took up the challenge of accepting my cognitive linguistic and cognitive anthropological approach to spatial language and cognition.
Thanks also go to my former Ph.D. supervisor Sally Rice at the University of Alberta, who introduced me to the Dene language and culture a decade ago. She also introduced me to the Dene speakers of the Cold Lake community and the Daghida project which aims to revitalize the Dene language. The Cold Lake speakers have been very patient with me during the different elicitation tests they were exposed to through the years. A decade ago, too, David Beck introduced me to Upper Necaxa Totonac at the University of Alberta. I had never heard of Dene and Totonac before my arrival in Canada in 2001. Thanks for broadening my language, linguistic and cultural scope. This also applies to Wulf Schiefenhövel and Volker Heeschen who introduced me to Eipomek in my Berlin years at the Topoi Excellence Cluster ‘The Formation and Transformation of Space and Knowledge’. Their input, drawing on about 40 years of working on and with Eipo, continues to exert a tremendous influence on

my work. They were also the co-supervisors of my habilitation treatise. Thank you for your support.
As a research scholar of the Topoi Excellence Cluster I worked within the Historical Epistemology of Space group at the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science (MPIWG). The institute has been vital in enabling me to considerably broaden my research scope. First and foremost I would like to thank Jürgen Renn, director of Department I, for having me at the MPIWG and providing an ideal infrastructure. Matthias Schemmel, the head of our group, and Peter Damerow (†) provided commentary and criticism of my narrow linguistic point of view. I would also like to thank the library staff who provided state-of-the-art service in retrieving books, papers etc. They have always been very helpful.
Over the years and countless meetings at the MPIWG I changed my research foci and started to ask different questions. Discussing these questions with my colleagues on a daily basis has always been very helpful and fruitful. Beside the academic discussions I want to thank Anna for daily trips to the Veggie Mensa. She listened to my issues and always lent an ear, and not just for academic problems. Along with music, Sascha could talk about spatial issues and philosophical problems at Berghain or Death Disco at three in the morning. Thanks to Pietro for the excellent espressi and his intellectual quibbles on space, life and everything, and to Irina who thinks that most problems are ‘trivial’ (she is a mathematician and astronomer by training). All in all we were a great group of researchers coming from different research fields discussing epistemological and philosophical issues. This book profited greatly from these fruitful, interdisciplinary – and sometimes stressful and seemingly endless – discussions. I want to thank the office of Department I at the MPIWG, and not just for the academic atmosphere; Shadiye Leather-Barrow and Petra Schröter, especially, always had an open door, with an ear for more than just academic quibbles.
Klaus Geus from our Mental Modeling group at the Topoi Excellence Cluster has been very supportive. The C-5-1 group, specifically, had to deal with my annoying implementations of mental model theory and cognitive linguistic issues.
Special thanks to all of my students at the Department of Philosophy at the Humboldt University and the Department of Linguistics at the Technical University Berlin. Many years of teaching classes gave me the opportunity to discuss a number of research-related issues. The atmosphere in class was always very stimulating. I want to thank Sebastian, especially, for sharing not just his intellect, but also Muzak and for joining me as we dived into different tonal areas both at home and live. Sven not

Very personal thanks go to my old, dear friends from Hamburg: Christian, Martin, Olaf and Tim. Many nights have passed since EWS, Essotanke, KIR, and the Kaifuschwimmbad to name just a few places, instances and events.
I especially want to thank Anke and Jochen for their unwavering support on various levels. You have been very patient with me. Thank you for believing in me and keeping me going. Finally, of all the people who have been supporting me the last years and always had faith in me, I dedicate this work to Susann. Thank you so much!

Chapter 1: Setting the stage
Because Cognitive Linguistics sees language as embedded in the overall cognitive capacities of man, topics of special interest for Cognitive Linguistics include: the structural characteristics of natural language categorization (such as prototypicality, systematic polysemy, cognitive models, mental imagery, and metaphor); the functional principles of linguistic organization (such as iconicity and naturalness); the conceptual interface between syntax and semantics (as explored by Cognitive Grammar and Construction Grammar); the experiential and pragmatic background of language-in-use; and the relationship between language and thought, including questions about relativism and conceptual universals. (Geeraerts and Cuyckens 2007: 4)
1.1 Introduction
Humans move in space on a daily basis and as a daily practice, they consciously talk about space, and unconsciously use spatial metaphors. As such, humans apply different cultural practices using different semiotic systems (see Holland and Quinn 2000; Palmer 1996). Bickel argues more specifically
that the cultural forms of social practices do indeed show ‘affinities’ to linguistic patterns. I argue that Whorfian effects of language on thought can be fully understood only once we take seriously the role of sociocultural practice. This is not only important […] with regard to sociocultural practices in artistic discourses but also in nonverbal activities from weaving and house-building to ritual and settlement habits. (Bickel 2000: 161–162)
They impose mediate and immediate spatial relations encoded as symbolic, analogue1 and digital structures (Nöth 2000: 178, 200; see also Morris 1938; Ogden and Richards 1923). Symbolic structures can be words, pictures, gestures or verbal, graphic and pictorial coding systems.2
Spatial encoding mechanisms are essential prerequisites for spatial orientation as a daily routine (Bickel 1997)3.

1 Analogue codes can also be pictures, diagrams, films, construction models (Nöth 2000: 218).
2 Note that the difference between symbolic and analogue is not as clear-cut as it seems here. For a comprehensive overview the reader should consult the three comprehensive volumes of A Handbook on the Sign-Theoretic Foundations of Nature and Culture, edited by Roland Posner, Klaus Robering and Thomas A. Sebeok (1997–2003).
3 “Orientation is, like topology, very well suited for a qualitative approach. In everyday (nontechnical) communication, orientation of spatial entities with respect to other spatial entities is usually given in terms of a qualitative category like “to the left of” or “northeast of” rather than using a numerical expression like “53 degrees” (which is certainly more common in technical communication like in aviation). Unlike the topological approaches we

1.1 Introduction

Performing a mundane activity, such as walking to a library, selecting a book from the collection, bringing it to the circulation desk, checking it out, and taking it home, is of complexity far outstripping any known formal description of it. Such routines involve the coordination of multiple acts of sensing, perceiving, moving, and conceptualizing in a three-dimensional world. It is these mundane activities that are most likely to reveal the basic features of human thought and language. Walking to the library already depends on a long history of simpler experiential patterns filtered through culture [and hence language; M.T.] and the individuals it claims as its own. (Oakley 2007: 214)
Different knowledge systems are at work at the conceptual level. These are understood as underlying categorization patterns of spatial orientation processes.
Linguistically, people in different languages and cultures use different encoding devices to relate spatial information.
The world consists of a virtually infinite number of discriminably different stimuli. One of the most basic functions of all organisms is the cutting up of the environment into classifications by which nonidentical stimuli can be treated as equivalent. (Rosch 1977: 212) […] every language reflects a certain perspective on the world and encoding strategies. (Wolff and Malt 2010: 4)
Language as a semiotic system thus plays a crucial role in the instantiation of immediate and mediate spatial relations, but language is certainly only one part of the spatial story. This present spatial story combines, among other aspects, linguistic and cognitive structures based on mental images and environmental input.
Humans mark different aspects of spatial scenes, they mentally rotate relationships and they include a variety of aspects based on their knowledge systems, that is, encyclopedic knowledge, declarative and procedural cognitive systems (Anderson 2010). Therefore it is fair to state that spatial language and spatial cognition are constant companions in daily life (see Jackendoff and Landau 2002).
In a nutshell, the human capacity for constructing and relating objects in space depends not only on objectively given features, but also, if not primarily, on subjective encoding decisions. The hypothesis is that the parallels between language, cognition and visual perception indicate a bridging element between those levels of human conceptual organization (Gibson 1986: 147–237). I argue that there is no neutral or absolute construal, but either a construal that either mention the vantage point of the speaker or does not. This means that the speaker’s perspective is ex-

discussed in the previous section, orientation of spatial entities is a ternary relationship depending on the located object, the reference object, and the frame of reference which can be specified either by a third object or by a given direction” (Renz and Nebel 2007: 172–173; emphasis original).

pressed in some languages, and not in others. These assumptions are surveyed with respect to spatial language and spatial cognition. Or to put it another way
[r]ather than depending on a logical or geometrical system of description, I will offer a description of spatial words based on functional concepts that are tied to the extralinguistic knowledge of space shared by the speakers of one language. […] I use functional in the sense of utilitarian. Geometrical and logical analysis describe spatial terms by means of formal concepts that are independent of context […] In contrast, a functional description–I might even say a “utilitarian” description–depends also on nonspatial factors that are determined by the context and by the circumstances of the use of the prepositional terms. (Vandeloise 1991: 13 and footnote 6, page 239; highlight original)
Vandeloise points out that, rather than logical descriptions of spatial relations, we should instead focus on functional or rather language usages (for a rather logical-based description see Knauff 2013). This could be termed a cognitive pragmatics approach. Other semiotic and non-semiotic factors also play a crucial role in spatial semiotics. Hence, I will present nonspatial factors as well, such as practices and the speaker’s choice of vantage points.
This book also explores the degree to which environmental experience and spatial orientation are reflected in texts, myths, language and practices as joint action procedures. It is argued that non-linguistic information as cultural practice and implicit knowledge system has an impact on spatial language and categorization. Topographical information, but also scale, scope, distance of the immediate environment, are represented as spatial mental models of topographical coordinates.4 Data will show the constructive process of environmental landmarks and cultural heritage on mediate shaping of spatial categorization, but also speakers’ choice of immediate spatial construals in figure-ground relations.

4 “As psychological representations of real, hypothetical, or imaginary situations, mental models were first postulated by the Scottish psychologist Kenneth Craik (1943), who wrote that the mind constructs “small-scale models” of reality to anticipate events, to reason, and to underlie explanation. The models are constructed in working memory as a result of perception, the comprehension of discourse, or imagination (see Marr 1982; Johnson-Laird 1983). A crucial feature is that their structure corresponds to the structure of what they represent. Mental models are accordingly akin to architects’ models of buildings and to chemists’ models of complex molecules” (Johnson-Laird 1999: 525–526). Nöth presents a very clear definition of a mental picture that is similar to a mental model in its representative function: “Unter einem (mentalen) Bild versteht auch die kognitive Psychologie die mentale Reproduktion oder Repräsentation einer nicht gegenwärtigen perzeptuellen Erfahrung” (Nöth 2000: 232). Basically, Nöth summarizes cognitive psychological theories on mental models as mental reproductions and representations of a non-present visual experience. By that, it is also an ethnogeographic account of place names, distances between cities or other localities, or coastlines etc. (Mark et al. 2011; Smith and Mark 2001).

1.1 Introduction

Hence, we cannot take for granted the “real world” as the domain of entities to which language refers. Rather, the information that speakers can convey must be about their construal of the external world, where one’s construal is the result of an interaction between external input and the means available to internally represent it (Jackendoff 1988: 83; emphasis original).
Previously published papers which focus on spatial language and spatial cognition in general are also presented.5 So this book offers not just empirical linguistic data on the spatial conceptualization of specific spatial relations, but also spatial practices6. Different coding devices are used in mastering spatial orientation and spatial coordination, that is, “given the fundamental nature and importance of spatial cognition, it is of considerable interest to determine the ways in which it connects to language” (Peterson, Nadel, Bloom and Garrett 1996: 553). My approach is therefore an “investigation into the meaning of spatial language that regards language as an integrated part of human cognition” (Zlatev 2007: 318). Certainly, languages of space or ideas of space point to cognitive structures and categorization processes of spatial mental models. Language serves as a semiotic system, as do practices of joint action as seen in place names, frames of reference, geometric relations and the like, that is, language as semiotic form externalizes the cognitive construction of the vision of the world (Lucy 1996: 38). John Lucy calls this idea the hypothesis of semiotic relativity (Lucy 1996: 39).
It is argued that language as a semiotic system externalizes implicit knowledge representations: these are mental models or cultural models (see Gentner and Stevens 1983; Palmer 2007: 1046). Moreover, language as a semiotic system is also “an integral part of human cognition”.7
For large-scale orientation, landmarks on land and at sea are used as proximate course-maintaining devices. These landmarks shape and determine a detailed topographical mental model of the environment as represented via language and various practices (Bickel 2000).
“Landmark” refers to any kind of culture-specific environmental reference point. This could be a mountain, a river, a house, trees, reefs,

"""""""""""""!
5 These papers have been extensively revised to fit the general structure of this book. 6 Gumperz and Levinson highlight the importance of practices, arguing one “cannot think
of a “world-view” as inherent in a language, somehow detached from all the practices established for its use” (Gumperz and Levinson 1996: 230; emphasis original). Conceptualization is used here as a “cover term that refers to fundamental cognitive processes such as schematization and categorization” (Sharifian 2011: 4; emphasis original). With respect to practices Levinson (2003) also uses the idea of experiencing-for-thinking based on Slobin’s (1996) thinking-for-speaking argument. 7 As noted above, “[a]n account of linguistic structure should therefore articulate with what is known about cognitive processing in general […]” (Langacker 1987: 13).

waves, islands or roads. Landmarks are point references external to the person. (Kettunen, Irvankoski, Krause and Sarjakoski 2013: 245)
In a city, landmarks may be distant buildings or geographical features that can be seen from many angles and distances, or they may be more local features, such as buildings, signs, trees, storefronts, doorknobs, and other urban details (Burgmanis, Krisjane and Skilters 2014; Golledge, and Rushton 1976; Lynch 1960). Landmarks are unique configurations of perceptual events. They identify a specific geographical location.
Landmarks are important as reference points for understanding spatial structure through relations as well as identifying decision points and monitoring progress during navigation […]. Consequently, the level of landmark knowledge has important implications for all human spatial activities. Landmark knowledge can be acquired through direct experience with the environment or through external representations of the environment, such as verbal descriptions, photographs or maps […]. (Kettunen, Irvankoski, Krause and Sarjakoski 2013: 245)
A person’s account of his/her spatial representation generally begins with landmarks, and these function as the strategic foci to and from which the person moves or travels. Hence, they identify not only beginnings and endings, but also assist in maintaining one’s course.
Landmarks can be construed to the convenience of the traveller as seen in the way members of some Micronesian cultures navigate by referring to a phantom island (see below). I argue that landmarks are used as proximate course-maintaining devices in the encoding of figure-ground asymmetries. I further argue that these landmarks shape and determine a detailed topographical map of the environment as represented via semiotic systems such as language and practices. Burenhult and Levinson specifically examine how landscape features appear as nameable objects and, particularly, whether universal categories can be applied (Burenhult and Levinson 2008: 136). Moreover, they argue that landmarks, or rather environments are, interesting features of (spatial) categorization (see also Mark, Turk, Burenhult, and Stea 2011).
One aim of this book is to present some of the most fundamental spatial notions based on environmental or regional landmarks as transmitted and represented in different empirical sources to apply figure-ground parsing construals of immediate and mediate spaces in the encoding of spatial relations.
The point of departure is a closer investigation of spatial mental models based – although not exclusively – on linguistic cues. Spatial mental models are cognitive knowledge structures based on perceptual and phe-

1.1 Introduction

nomenological experience.8 These models map spatial structures onto conceptual structures (Oakley 2007: 215). Spatial mental models represent, among other knowledge systems, spatial information at an abstract conceptual level of cognitive representation. They are a cognitive layout of the spatial environment and human experience as represented in long-term memory (Burgmanis, Krisjane and Skilters 2014; Wilson and Keil 1999: 25). Knowledge about space (and time) must be integrated to enable human orientation in the environment. Humans are capable of forming sophisticated representations of spatial relations integrated as mental models. Some more central mental representations appear to be closely tied to perceptual systems (Ehrenfels 1890; Jastrow 1899; Pinna 2010; Rubin 1921; Thiering 2011; Wertheimer 1923).
The representation of cognitive cues is modeled in cognitive psychology as schemas, frames, scenarios, scripts, mental models, mental frames, slots and cognitive maps.9 I argue that spatial mental models in particular are often collections of, and based on, toponyms, landmarks, frames of reference and other cues. Indeed, I argue that these models are based on gestalt principles that help to mentally triangulate a reference or coordinate system. Spatial cognition is thus the mental abstract representation of such knowledge systems via spatial mental models.
Minsky points out that human beings always have mental models of the world construed on the basis of brain functions. This reduction to brain function is nowadays bridged by situated, enacted or embodied cognition, and distributed cognition (see Gallagher 2005; Robbins and Aydede 2009; Varela, Thompson and Rosch 1991; Zlatev 2010). Hence, cognition is a mediator between the phenomenological world and the semiotic representation, and spatial mental models are the actual constructing devices, or rather abstract mental representation, of the projected or “real” world (Cienki 1989: 19–23; Jackendoff 1983, 1996; Johnson-Laird 1983; Krumnack, Bucher, Nejasmic, Nebel and Knauff 2011; Minsky 1994; Bloom, Peterson, Nadel and Garrett 1996, Chapter 15).

8 This connection between languages as symbolic systems and cognition is summarized by Palmer. He argues that “language is the play of verbal symbols that are based in imagery. Imagery is what we see in our mind’s eye, but it is also the taste of a mango, the feel of walking in a tropical downpour […]” (Palmer 1996: 3).
9 “Another important function of visual imagery is to help us figure out and remember the spatial structure of our environment. Our imaginal representations of the world are often referred to as cognitive maps. The connection between imagery and action is particularly apparent in cognitive map. We often find ourselves imaging our environment as we plan how we will get from one location to another” (Anderson 2010: 106; see also Mark et al. 1999).

My hypothesis is that linguistic cues are symbolic systems reflecting patterns of thought, but that they do not mirror conceptual representations. There is no simple, direct relation between conceptual representation and linguistic expression, but rather a much more complex relation which can be understood in terms of the cultural-cognitive view of language10. In the introductory quote, the editors of the Oxford Handbook of Cognitive Linguistics pinpoint one of the major issues in current cognitive linguistic approaches as the relationship between language and thought and the question of linguistic relativism as opposed to conceptual universals. Evans and Green are very explicit in their Cognitive Linguistics: An Introduction, arguing that
[…] language reflects patterns of thought. Therefore, to study language […] is to study patterns of conceptualization. Language offers a window into cognitive function, providing insights into the nature, structure and organization of thoughts and ideas. (Evans and Green 2007: 5; emphasis original)
They further argue that “language reflects patterns of thought, and can be seen as a means of encoding and externalizing thought” (Evans and Green 2007: 98). The common thread in my approach is indeed an assumed interrelation between language (culture), cognition and perception, but to claim that “to study language is to study patterns of conceptualization” might be overstating the case. Language is only one of the many externalized semiotic patterns necessary for the instantiation of spatial mental models. Nonetheless I subscribe to the dictum, widely held in the field of cognitive linguistics, that languages reflect conceptual structure and that variations across languages encode different conceptual systems (Evans and Green 2007; Everett 2013; Langacker 1987; Levinson 2003; Levinson and Wilkins 2006; Talmy 2000; Thiering 2009b). I also subscribe to Humboldt’s Weltansichten (he also refers to Weltanschauung and Weltbild; see Humboldt 1963a,b; Miller 1968; Underhill 2013) or the better known Neo-Whorfian concept that culture influences thought through language (see below).
As I understand it, this can be interpreted as extension of Ray Jackendoff’s statement that “to study semantics of natural language is to study cognitive psychology” (Jackendoff 1983: 3; emphasis original). Ray Jackendoff’s concept of generative cognitivism (personal communication) presents a fully-fledged model of semantic structure and conceptual struc-

1.1 Introduction

ture.11 Jackendoff proposes a projected, or mental, world (Jackendoff 1983: 23–29), hence, cognition is a mediator between the speaker and the phenomenological world.
Complementing Miller and Johnson-Laird’s (1976) fundamental survey of language and perception, Jackendoff’s models in 1983 (19–22) and 1996 (1–13) laid the groundwork for an understanding of spatial representation in language and cognition. Jackendoff also specifically introduces a gestalt theory approach to visual perception, but persists with modular systems that are connected via an intermediate module. He bases his analysis on rule systems that are similar to Johnson-Laird’s syllogisms (Johnson-Laird 1983: 64–93). I believe that these systems can only be regarded as the starting point in spatial description. Here it is essential that phenomenological approaches and gestalt principles be addressed more seriously.
There has been much discussion about the influence of culture — through language — on cognition. This discussion is associated in the canon with the Sapir-Whorf theory and, since the 1990s, Neo-Whorfian theory (Deutscher 2010; Everett 2013; Gumperz and Levinson 1996: 1– 18, 21–28; Lucy 1992:a 11–68, 84–187; Levinson 2003: 24–111, 280–325; Levinson and Wilkins 2006: 1–23, 512–552; Niemeier and Dirven 2000; Penn; 1972; Thiering 2013b; critical accounts come from Gipper 1972 and his Ph.D. student Malotki 1979; Pullum 1991). According to NeoWhorfian hypothesis, languages influence or even determine the shaping of cognitive structures, hence, different linguistic encodings present different categorization processes (see Everett 2013 for a comprehensive overview). More specifically, “culture through language affects the way we

"""""""""""""!
11 Jackendoff’s work is based on some of the early 1980s theorists in cognitive psychology and related areas (Johnson-Laird 1983; Fodor 1983; Marr 1982). A general introduction to cognitive psychology is presented in Neisser (1976: 1–78, 177–195; see also Neisser 1987), Schank and Abelson (1977: 1–21, 36–68), and specifically the work on categorization by Rosch and Lloyd (1978). Jackendoff (1983: 23–37) starts with gestalt theory approaches based on Wertheimer, Köhler, Koffka (see the chapter on Figure-Ground Reversals in Language in this book), but also Wittgenstein’s duck-rabbit figure (Jackendoff 1983: 23–29). Note that the origin of the duck-rabbit is Jastrow 1899. Jastrow’s The mind’s eye introduces a number of optical illusions that foreshadow later experimental designs as outlined by Köhler, Koffka, and Wertheimer in the 1920s and 30s (see also Jastrow 1899; Müller-Lyer 1889). As early as 1890, Von Ehrenfels introduced Gestaltqualitäten (gestalt qualities) which are positive Vorstellungsinhalte, welche an das Vorhandensein von Vorstellungscomplexen im Bewusstsein gebunden sind, die ihrerseits aus von einander entfernt sind ‘gestalt qualities as mental content or representation which are bound to mental or conscious representations’; Ehrenfels 1890: 262).

think, especially perhaps our classification of the experienced world” (Gumperz and Levinson 1996: 1).12 Returning to the introductory quotation, I agree that language, cognition and culture are somehow interlocked. Decades before the Sapir-Whorf theory came into being, Wilhelm von Humboldt and others (e.g., Herder, Steinthal, Wundt; see Penn 1972 and Miller 1968 for an overview) were already focusing on the relationship between culture, language and thinking (the term “cognition” was not then in use). According to Wilhelm von Humboldt, different languages encode different worldviews, or Weltansichten (for an extensive review see Thiering 2013b; Trabant 2012; on the different concepts of the German meanings see Underhill 2013; in his criticism of the Sapir-Whorf theory Malotki analyzes Hopi spatial terms and uses the term Raumbilder, that is, ideas of space, instead of Weltansichten). In accordance with Wilhelm von Humboldt and Franz Boas – if only loosely – I argue that language is a form of symbolic encoding pattern based on spatial mental models. As such, languages also follow perceptual, experiential and environmental input. It is not only language and visual perception which influence cognition, but conversely, too, cognition influences language.
Indeed cognitive grammarian Ronald Langacker argues that general cognitive abilities shape language and that language structures relate directly to cognitive processing (Langacker 1987: 5). As Ray Jackendoff puts it, semantic structure is isomorphic with conceptual structure (Jackendoff 1983). I submit that different languages point to different encoding decisions based on culture-specific spatial mental models. I also argue that different cultures have different strategies for encoding these spatial relationships. Moreover, the different chapters in this book pursue the idea that cultural knowledge as symbolic practices, as I call them, is interwoven with cognitive structures and cognitive semantics in particular. The aim is to employ spatial mental models which establish the correspondence be-

12 “[i]t’s an old question. Does language affect how we think? [...][t]he central question addressed by this book [Linguistic Relativity: Evidence Across Languages and Cognitive Domains; M.T.] is whether differences between languages affect the nonlinguistic cognition of their speakers. We have found strong evidence for a positive answer to this question. Nevertheless, many of realistic effects we have discussed are subtle in nature. Still, the majority oft he data we have examined suggest that systematic differences in linguistic practice can and do create divergent cognitive habits. And like all habits, they may be hard to break” (Everett 2013: 1, 275). Everett presents different Whorfian effects in different categories or cognitive domains. Hence, language affects different domains in a different manner. Some effects are rather subtle, others are more obvious as in the spatial domain. To dismiss Whorfian effects in general is hence a simplification of the different cultural-specific influences upon cognition.

1.1 Introduction

tween “real world” cues, such as objects and places, and their symbolic equivalents in the models.
Here I refer to Nunberg with respect to the impact of (symbolic) practices. He argues that
[n]otwithstanding the title of this essay [The Pragmatics of Reference; M.T.], or the fact that I will be spending the largest part of it in discussing the ways in which speakers bring non-linguistic information to bear in interpreting utterances, its subject is linguistic knowledge: specifically, speaker’s knowledge of the conventions that govern the use of words. [...] knowledge of word-meanings can only be treated as an inseparable part of knowledge of other kinds of conventions and social practices, from which it cannot, even in theory, be isolated. (Nunberg 1978: 1)
Hence, as Heeschen and others also claim (see below), semantics, more specifically spatial semantics, and semiotics have to be viewed as “an inseparable part of knowledge of other kinds of [semiotic; M.T.] conventions and social practices”. I believe that this is crucial in a theory of spatial mental models. Social practices as outlined by Heeschen are, in accordance with Wittgenstein’s “meaning as use” in language, at least with respect to word classes
[f]or a large class of cases–though not for all–in which we employ the word “meaning” it can be defined thus: the meaning of a word is its use in the language. (Wittgenstein 2006: 20; § 43)
Actual practices in spatial orientation refer to a number of spatial information systems which are not only linguistically available, but are encoded in the actual usages or applications as joint action (for example, in the collective construction of a house in Eipo). In a nutshell, this research addresses questions of universality and culture-dependence of spatial thinking in societies which codify spatial knowledge almost exclusively by means of spoken language and joint action. These questions are addressed through a comparison of spatial languages and practices in three independent nonliterate societies, Eipo, Dene Chipewyan, and Upper Necaxa Totonac, located in a mountainous region (Eipo), the prairies of Western Canada (Dene) and the valley of the Necaxa River, Mexico, respectively. Data evidence from other languages is also included where appropriate.13
The book takes these very basic assumptions as its starting point. It is the result of five years of research and fieldwork I conducted between

This work is less dogmatic, but opens up for new perspectives.

2002 until 2006, looking at spatial semantics and spatial cognition from a broad interdisciplinary and cross-cultural perspective. It includes not only descriptions of linguistic spatial encoding patterns and cognitive structures, but also spatial language as practices and environmental landmarks of spatial orientation14 as encoded in toponyms, stories and sacred sites. Surveys variously cover micro-scale, immediate cognitive structures, such as figure-ground reversals, and macro-scale, mediate structures, such as toponyms.
The aim of this introduction is to provide, along with a few prefatory remarks, a guide through the different chapters, topics and scopes, and to present a coherent overarching argumentation of the topic at hand. I survey different spatially relevant parameters in different cultures and languages to present a kaleidoscopic rendering of spatial cognition from an essentially non-European linguistic point of view (see Casad and Palmer 2003). Key words include figure-ground asymmetries, degrees of specificity, frames of reference, cognitive maps, spatial mental models, landmark orientation, ethnolinguistics, ethnogeography, and the linguistic relativity principle. These different analytical and disciplinary concepts form the framework for this book.

1.2 Behind the stage I: theoretical preliminaries
This chapter begins with a high-level summary of the history of cognitive linguistics. A long-standing tradition in philosophy argues that language must be grounded in reality (Davis 2003; Hershenson 1999; Marr 1982). This idea of language as a mirror of reality is known as “linguistic realism” or “naive realism” (Lehar 2003). Wittgenstein rejects this view, as do others (Wittgenstein 2006; Monk 1990; Mulhall 1990; Rundle 1990; Sluga and Stern 1996; Tyler and Evans 2003; Vohra 1986; Zlatev 1997). He claims that in acquiring language, humans also acquire the objects of the projected external world (Piaget 1976; 1992; Piaget and Inhelder 1956; Heidegger 1985; Schmidt 1994, 1996, 1998; Watzlawick 1981).
I then address the idea, to which most cognitive linguists subscribe, that language is not only anchored in an objective reality. The question,

then, is whether it is in direct contact with cognition through sense perception. Indeed, it is only our language as a semiotic system which presents an essential means of external representation and cognitive apparatus which influences the kind of contact and interpretation we have with or of reality (Svorou 1993: 32). Cognition, then, or more specifically mental spaces, are understood here as a mediator (Fauconnier 1994, 1997; Jackendoff 1983; Knauff 2013) through which we perceive the outside world, even when the objects and their spatial location seem stable and real (Fauconnier 1997: 34). We will see that environmental aspects do indeed play a crucial role in language and cognition, at least in the languages and cultures under review.
Most classic approaches to the modeling of cognitive processes as human information mechanisms are based on the Turing machine analogy (Penrose 1991: 28–71; Strube, Becker, Freksa, Hahn, Opwis and Palm 1996). This serial computer metaphor regards the brain as an input-output device having both long-term and working-memory capacity (Anderson 1983, 2010; Arbib, Caplan and Marshall 1982; Baddeley 1990). This approach is based on the idea of an information transmission device (Anderson 1983, 1996; Baddeley 1990; Gathercole and Baddeley 1993; Penrose 1991). This implies that representational units are stored in the brain isomorphic to events in the real world (Aitchison 2003; Emmorey and Fromkin 1988; Rumelhart and McClelland, 1986; Schreuder and Flores d’Arcais 1989; Tergan 1989; Spektrum der Wissenschaft 1994). Within such a model, language serves merely as a code, transmitting information between cognition and the outside world (Penrose 1991). I argue, however, that language has a constructive character in that it serves as a device to develop and maintain mental spaces. These in turn are influenced by cultural, social, historical, phylogenetic and ontogenetic factors within one’s community.
The dominant philosophical tradition in the cognitive sciences has long claimed that all languages share the same underlying universal grammar and, by logical extension, the same conceptual structure (Chomsky 1965; Fodor 1983, 1998; Fodor and Katz 1964; Hillert 1987; Wierzbicka 1972, 1992, 1996). According to this view, the conceptual structure is based on perception, and visual perception of space in particular is regarded as an externally-cued input system which transmits information through our senses. Cognition is considered the interface between the world “out there” and the internal mental representations we have of it (Anderson 1983; Damasio and Damasio 1994; Dunbar 1991; Dutke 1994; Engelkamp 1991, 1995; Fauconnier and Turner 2002; Gillett 1992; Hershenson 1999; Jackendoff 1983, 1987). These representations are said

to have developed out of physiological factors and to be genetically determined structures of the brain (Schnelle 1994; Spektrum der Wissenschaft 1994; Sucharowski 1996; Strohner 1995; Spitzer 1996; Tergan 1989).
In other words, the focus has been on the brain as the organ in which all human activity is located, whereas the issue of embodiment – the idea that the human body serves as the anchor for all experience – has received less attention (on cognition, brain and memory, see Dunbar 1991; Ender 1994; Engelkamp and Pechmann 1988). In conclusion, perception is not assumed to be affected by language or culture alone, but also individual affordances which depend on one’s experience with mediated reality (Allwood and Gärdenfors 1998; Neisser 1987).
Slobin emphatically argues that perception and language are related and that the way human beings perceive the world is affected by the way they talk about it (see also Miller and Johnson-Laird 1976: 2).
[W]e can only talk and understand one another in terms of a particular language. The language of languages we learn in childhood is a subjective orientation to the world of human experience, and this orientation affects the ways in which we think while we are speaking. (Slobin 1996: 91)15
Furthermore, it is claimed that it is not just the brain, but the whole human body which serves as an anchor for human experience. Hence, the interaction between semiotic systems – such as language and gestures – and perception is a basic process of mediation performed by, and based on, the human body (Johnson 1987; Zlatev 1997, 2010).
Some of the main features of cognitive linguistics were introduced in the early 1980s by George Lakoff, Ronald Langacker, and Leonard Talmy (Lakoff 1987a; Langacker 1987, 1988, 1990, 1991, 2000; Talmy 1978, 1983, 2000). They place spatial meaning at the center of language and cognition, and so it is only natural to refer to this framework in this book (see Gentner and Goldin-Meadow 2003). In addition, proponents of cognitive linguistics refer specifically to the semiotic tradition as outlined by Ferdinand de Saussure and others (Saussure 2013). Langacker bases his framework on the semiotic tradition of the arbitrary sign and different binary systems such as langue versus parole, signifier versus signified, and synchronic versus diachronic. A crucial factor here is that for many grammatical categories, membership is essentially arbitrary from a semantic point of

view, which contradicts traditional truth-conditional semantics based on propositional value (Kreitzer 1997).
One of the major hypotheses in cognitive psychology (which was the precursor to cognitive linguistics) is the idea of mental representations as abstract schemas, or mental spaces, or mental models (Gentner and Stevens 1983; Johnson-Laird 1983, 2005; Knauff 2013; Penrose 1991; Ritter, Martinez and Schulten 1991; Schade 1992; Schreuder 1989; Strube et al. 1996). As the gestalt psychological approach suggests, such schemas are universal and not language-specific. Moreover, they are abstract representations of human thoughts and events, that is, they are non-linguistic. They are extracted from more specific structures and categorize such structures through relations of full or partial schematicity. Language is thus regarded as a cognitive phenomenon represented in the mental lexicon, that is, a storage metaphor which implies abstract structures (Aitchison 2003; Ender 1994; Engelkamp 1991, 1994, 1995; Handke 1995; Schwarz 1994, 1995).
The idea of abstract representation leads more specifically to the general claim in cognitive linguistics that all grammatical structures are symbolic and that lexicon, morphology, and syntax form a continuum of symbolic units, each residing in the association of a semantic and phonological structure, or “pole” (Langacker 1987).
Moreover, the meanings of linguistic expressions are conceptualizations shaped in accordance with the given linguistic system. In addition, all facets of our general knowledge of a conceived entity contribute to the meaning of an expression which designates this entity, meaning that a rigid distinction between semantics and pragmatics is superfluous (Nunberg 1978; Sweetser 1990). According to this view, semantics is not an autonomous cognitive entity, nor is the overall linguistic system.
It has been claimed that semantic structures are predications characterized relative to cognitive domains such as time, space and color. Most domains of linguistic relevance are non-primitive, meaning that they are interrelated networks (Wender 1980; Zell 1994). As such, they involve cognitive structures of indefinite complexity, offering layers of interrelated networks which can be modeled in a connectionist manner (Bechtel and Abrahamsen 1991; Birbaumer and Schmidt 1993; Edelman 2002; Hillert 1987, 1992; Kandel and Hawkins 1994; Murre and Goebel 1996). Any cognitive structure can function as the domain for predications (Langacker 1987: 56).
Moreover, meaning is conceived as cognitive processing, and even expressions used to describe an ostensibly objective situation may differ in meaning depending on how the situation is construed. This is known

from figure-ground reversals as described below (Thiering 2011). An expression imposes a particular image on its domain. Imagery is used as a technical term for the cognitive capacity for construing a cognitive domain in different ways.
Foreshadowing the figure-ground asymmetry, the basic definition claims that a physical object is located, or moves, with respect to another object which serves as a reference point (Talmy1978: 627)16. This asymmetry is embedded in schematization. Schematization is the process by which specific aspects of a reference point of a scene representing the whole gestalt are profiled (Talmy 2000; Sinha and Kuteva 1995). The empirical evidence presented below also supports this observation.

1.3 Behind the stage II: theoretical preliminaries in cognitive linguistics
Building on cognitive psychological research in the 1970s, cognitive semantics and cognitive grammar were introduced in the early 1980s by Leonard Talmy (1983, 2000), Ronald Langacker (1982, 1987, 1991, 2008), and George Lakoff (1987a,b), all trained in the school of generative grammar. The idea that languages are based on visual gestalt structures and cognitive processes conflicts with the idea that language is a modular inner entity. This also raises the issue of whether there is a language faculty, and to the extent to which language structures are universal.
More specific work on spatial semantics by Annette Herskovits (1985, 1986), Claude Vandeloise (1990, 1991) and mental spaces theory by Gilles Fauconnier (1985) and mental models by Philip Johnson-Laird (1983) and the volume edited by Gentner and Stevens (1983) provided stimulus and a great deal of inspiration for this book.17 Although rather formal and modular, Ray Jackendoff’s work on semantics and cognition is of particular significance. As highlighted above, Jackendoff introduces and adopts gestalt theory approaches to visual perception, especially in his model of conceptual structure and spatial representation (Jackendoff 1983, 1996; see also Miller and Johnson-Laird’s book on language and perception 1976).

1.3 Behind the stage II: theoretical preliminaries in cognitive linguistics

However it is important not to rely too heavily on these assumptions of universals as opposed to relativism in spatial cognition. For now, the heuristic solution would be to avoid defining these two strands as a dichotomy, but – in line with Lev Wygotski18 and the later Wittgenstein – as oscillating systems. Wygotski argues that thinking and language (as well as speaking) are not separate processes running in parallel, but rather interdependent asymmetries (Wygotski 1964: 255). All this boils down to the early Wittgenstein’s claim that “the limits of my language are [not] the limits of my world”, but are one part of one’s world in addition to other semiotic systems, as I argue (thus I have added “not” to the quotation). In other words, “some aspects of spatial meaning cannot be expressed linguistically, just as some aspects of language do not correspond to spatial notions” (Peterson, Nadel, Bloom and Garrett 1996: 555).19 As argued above, the later Wittgenstein presents a detailed adaptation of gestalt theory and phenomenologist processes of visual construals in the second part of his Philosophical Investigations. I believe that these construals are much more complex than Talmy’s figure-ground usage based on gestalt theory models as outlined below. Some of these complexities are presented in this book.
There is a particular focus on spatial cognition and spatial semantics bridged by what is known as a “semiotics of space” approach. In 1987, the founder of space grammar (later cognitive grammar), Ronald Langacker, was already arguing that
[l]anguage is symbolic in nature. It makes available to the speaker–for either personal or communicative use–an open-ended set of linguistic signs or expressions, each of which associates a semantic representation of some kind with a phonological representation. (Langacker 1987: 11; emphasis original)
This book makes use of this very basic sign definition, that “language is symbolic in nature” as determined by Ferdinand de Saussure, the founder of structuralism. He introduces the dyadic signifié ‘signified’ and signifiant ‘signifier’, the concept/word asymmetry (Saussure 2013), which is extended here to more triadic models in line with Karl Bühler and others to include language as practice (or Wittgenstein’s idea that “meaning is language in use” and his aforementioned Aspektsehen and Aspektwechsel) as

well (see also Barthes 1981; Eco 1987; Muhall 1990). Heeschen concludes that
[s]pace can be recognized as an underlying principle of language and speech in two different ways. Firstly, movement in space and the spatial organisation and arrangement of things around us lie at the base of much abstract vocabulary, and secondly, the speech situation–that is, the triad of speaker, hearer and their shared perceptual field with the inclusion ‘of the thing meant’–is directly reflected in that part of language structure which Bühler (1934) called “Zeigfeld” (deictic field). (Heeschen 1982: 81)
Heeschen elaborates on the triadic function of a speech act in spatial deixis.20 Langacker again specifically combines the semantic and phonological pole to give meaning to the central focus of linguistic description as embedded in space. Consequently Langacker, too, highlights ‘the thing meant’, that is, that meaning is the focus of cognitive linguistics.
Most researchers in the cognitive sciences start from scratch, arguing in favor of one of the physical spaces, either Newtonian or Leibnizian, that is, absolute as opposed to relative space. In 2003, Levinson begins with “Ideas about spatial cognition in the Western tradition”, going on to mention Newton, Leibniz and of course Kant (Levinson 2003: 27; see Levinson 1996: 128; Levinson and Wilkins 2006: 1). Zlatev asks why spatial meaning is important to cognitive linguistic research. Beyond the simple fact that Langacker, the founder of cognitive grammar, originally wanted to call this new linguistic approach “space grammar”, Zlatev argues that space “pertains to a central and universal aspect of human experience, and thus constitutes a good searching ground for linguistic universals” (Zlatev 2007: 318). In his overview Zlatev points out that space is assumed in cognitive linguistics as the center of conceptualization, hence spatial categorization is arguably “the key to human conceptual categorization” (Zlatev 2007: 319).

20 Levinson claims that spatial deixis is not based on frames of reference (Levinson 2003: 71). “Deixis concerns the relativization of reference to properties of the speech event. Many aspects […] have nothing to do with spatial conception. But deixis is involved in the interpretation of spatial expressions in many different ways. […] [M]any statements of location and motion make overt reference to deictic parameters, as in It’s over there or He’s coming here. […] [D]eixis is simply a means of providing a rather special ground or reference point, namely the location of the speech participants” (Levinson 2003: 70). I use the term deixis as an element that has no stable referent but receives its semantic content from the situation or context of an utterance (Bal 1996: 72); Bühler 1999 [1934] makes the point that deixis or the deiktisches Feld is crucial in our daily communication).

features depart from these systems with respect to the cognitive conditions involved in figure-ground asymmetries and their cognitive semantic detail (see below).

1.4 Spatial cognitive semantics and spatial practices
This section presents some very basic preliminary remarks on spatial cognitive semantics. It argues that cognitive semantic descriptions must include spatial practices as a form of semiotic encoding processes that are not merely necessarily linguistic encodings. In cognitive semantics and cognitive anthropology21, semantic components also include or are based on cognitive maps, scripts, scenes, image schemas, frame systems and mental models (see Palmer 2007: 1046 on the intersection of cognitive grammar and idealized cognitive models; see also Duranti 2007; Foley 1997; Palmer 1996). These representational structures encode culturespecific factors, and these different factors are both semantic and cultural. Langacker maintains that semantic elements or units are “relative to cognitive domains” (Langacker 1987: 63). He claims that “linguistic semantics is held to be encyclopedic […] the meaning of an expression typically involves specifications in many cognitive domains” (Langacker 1987: 63). The main point here is that language systems are not separate, autonomous modules of cognitive processes, but that language and cognitive structures are closely connected through a battery of analogue and symbolic systems.
Cognition is also enacted and transcends the body as posited in situated cognition theories (Robbins and Aydede 2009; Zlatev 2010).
In recent years there has been a lot of buzz about a new trend in cognitive science. The trend is associated with terms like embodiment, enactivism, distributed cognition, and the extended mind. […] First, cognition depends not just on the brain but also on the body (the embodiment thesis). Second, cognitive activity routinely exploits structure in the natural and social environment (the embedding thesis). Third, the boundaries of cognition extend beyond the boundaries of individual organisms (the extension thesis). Each of these theses contributes to a picture of mental activity as dependent on the situation or context in which it occurs, whether that situation or context is relatively local (as in the case of embodiment) or relatively global (as in the case of embedding and extension). (Robbins and Aydede 2009: 3; emphasis original).
The importance of embodiment and distributed cognition is shown in the chapter on symbolic practices in Eipo and Dene. In this chapter, language

is only one part of the spatial story. The actual habitus of applying cognitive knowledge structures is at issue in the joint actions presented (Bourdieu 1976). In other words, spatial language refers to spatial usages based on spatial mental models. These spatial mental models are molded by symbolic systems, that is, language, practice, pictures, environment and the like (see below for an example).
The interplay of these different practices is best described in an analogy by Gibbs. He uses the practice of windsurfing as a metaphor for situated cognition.
The windsurfer continually affects and is affected by the set of the rig, so the behavioral intention to successfully windsurf emerges as a result of interaction between the person and the environment. Focusing on the agent alone, or on how the agent responds to the environment, fails to capture the complex nuances of windsurfing behavior. Just as it is important to understand the significance of paper and pencil when one does long division, where the cognition of doing long division is in part “offloaded” into the environment, the intentionality in windsurfing is best understood as a distributed cognitive behavior involving a person, a device, and the environment. (Gibbs 2001: 117–118)22
The interesting aspect here is the interplay of the agent and the environment with respect to spatial orientation. This example foreshadows the idea that figure-ground relations are not just cognitive constructions based on perceptual input, but also extend to environmental coordinates and joint action procedures. In Gibbs’ analogy the agent is the figure and the environment is the ground (see below). Depending on whether we are constructing the spatial mental models of people or showing how humans move in space, we must identify their a priori or implicit conceptual notions about symbolic and linguistic space.
The idea that cognition is structured as spatial mental models goes back to Tolman’s findings which suggest that animals and humans go beyond the information given when they go directly to a goal after having learned an indirect path (Tolman 1932, 1948; Wang and Spelke 2002). Applying an indirect path also means that they are using cognitive maps as abstract representations of their surroundings. That conclusion is strongest when the spatial cues marking the goal location are not visible from the starting position (Wilson and Keil 1999: 135; see also below on navigation techniques in cultures which don’t use nautical instruments and specifically the concept of a third, phantom or emergency island). These are

all important features of spatial mental models as cognitive computation mechanisms and processes in particular.
Palmer states that “[a]ll orientations are relative to cultural models [or spatial mental models; M.T.] of spatial structure. Often, languages provide grammatical instantiations of salient spatial schemas” (Palmer 2007: 1059). Languages do indeed provide such instantiations, but a further interesting aspect comes when languages fail to provide such information. This implicit aspect is also of interest, as are practices exemplified by implicit knowledge structures as outlined in the second chapter on spatial mental models.

1.5 Spatial semiotics and cognitive anthropology
The chapters in this work are inspired by Boas’ cultural-anthropological approach based on current cognitive semantic analytical tools.23 It also addresses Humboldt’s idea of different languages and their different worldviews (Humboldt 1963b [1830–1835]; Trabant 2012).24 Boas cautions readers that it is unreasonable to posit a direct relationship between a culture or community and the language they speak, but he allows that “the form of the language will be molded by the state of culture25, but not in so far as a certain state of culture is conditioned by morphological traits of the language” (Boas 1997[1911]: 67).26 I opt for a combination of cog-

23 The title could also be Semantics and Cognition based on Jackendoff’s book (1983). My reasons for choosing “Spatial semiotics and cognitive anthropology” are outlined below.
24 Die Sprache ist das bildende Organ des Gedanken. Die intellectuelle Thätigkeit, durchaus geistig, durchaus innerlich und gewissermassen spurlos vorübergehend, wird durch den Laut in der Rede äusserlich und wahrnehmbar für die Sinne. Sie und die Sprache sind daher Eins und unzertrennlich von einander (Humboldt 1963: 426).
25 I use Geertz’s essentially semiotic use of the term ‘culture’ (Geertz 1973: 5). Since the term culture has several meanings and theoretical backgrounds, I adopt the specific idea of culture from Clifford Geertz’s Interpretation of Culture: “The concept of culture is essentially a semiotic one. Believing that man is an animal suspended in webs of significance he himself has spun, I take culture to be those webs, and the analysis of it to be therefore not an experimental science in search of law but an interpretative one in search of meaning” (Geertz 1999: 5). Such webs of basic spatial categorization are shown in the cultures presented below.
26 Whorf states that “just as cultural facts are only culturally determined, not biologically determined, so linguistic facts, which are likewise cultural, and include linguistic element of thought, are only linguistically determined. They are determined not merely by language, but by languages” (Whorf 1956: 67). In a later paper, Whorf goes on to say that the “[f]ormulation of ideas is not an independent process, strictly rational in the old sense, but is part of a particular grammar, and differs, from slightly to greatly, between different grammars. We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native languages. The categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do not find there because they

nitive semantic and cognitive anthropological approaches to language and culture as represented by landmarks, ethnogeographic and topographical accounts. This kaleidoscopic approach indicates the intricacies of different influences on spatial language and cognition. Consequently symbolic and analogue spatial encodings are also surveyed.
As far as spatial language is concerned, certain spatial and perceptive features are encoded in different languages via different grammatical constructions, such as case systems, adpositions, posture verbs, body parts and classificatory verbs. In other words
[i]n some Papuan languages reference to space and direction (e.g. upwards, downwards) and to relative position of the referent to the speaker or hearer, is built into the verbal morphology […]” (Heeschen 1982: 82; emphasis original).
Culture, on the other hand, is not only represented in language or verbal morphology, but in actual practice, such as navigation through known or unknown environments or the joint action of building a house (Gladwin 1970; Hutchins 1996: 49–116; Gumperz and Levinson 1996: Part III; Levinson 2003: 216–279).
Levinson warns readers not to mix language and cognition, meaning that different linguistic systems do not necessarily suggest different underlying cognitive structures (Levinson: 2003: 63). He argues that
[t]he inference we can make is only in the other, positive direction, namely from the presence of any linguistic distinction to the need for its support by underlying cognitive systems, and this will already take us very far in understanding the nature of non-linguistic spatial reasoning […]. (Levinson 2003: 63)
I would add that it is not only “from the presence of any linguistic distinction”, but also from other encoding mechanisms, such as oral or actual hands-on practices. In contrast to Jackendoff, Levinson rightfully implies that there is no isomorphism between a word and a concept (but see below on Levinson’s change of arguments between 2003 and 2006). This therefore represents a critical approach to the idea that “to study semantics of natural language is to study cognitive psychology” (Jackendoff 1983: 3; emphasis original; see also Jackendoff 1996 and above). This view, similar to the “window-view” above from Evans and Green, might

stare every observer in the face; on the contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscopic flux of impressions which has to be organized by our minds–and this means largely by the linguistic systems in our minds. We cut nature up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this way–an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of our language” (Whorf 1956: 213; see Everett 2013 for an actual review on the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, and Thiering’s 2013b special volume on the Neo-Whorfian theory).

1.5 Spatial semiotics and cognitive anthropology

be too radical at this point, but certainly the study of spatial language gives insights into the cognitive processes and shows “the way languages structure the spatial domain” (Levinson and Wilkins 2006: XV). Jackendoff proposes that conceptual structure (CS) is universal, but that languages differ in their semantic patterns (Jackendoff 1996: 7). Jackendoff rightly points out that
languages can have different strategies in how they typically bundle up conceptual elements into lexical items. […] languages can [also] differ in what elements of conceptual structure they require the speaker to express syntax. (Jackendoff 1996: 6–7; emphasis original)
He goes on to argue “that there is a language-independent and universal level of CS” […] (Jackendoff 1996: 8; emphasis original). Levinson and Wilkins indirectly oppose this assumption by stating that
[t]he language of space becomes an important focus of research […] First, it may help to reveal the underlying conceptual structure in human spatial thinking […] [n]aturally, universals of spatial thinking should be reflected in universal conceptualizations in spatial language. Second […] the very variability of language promises an interesting insight into the possible cultural variability of spatial thinking. Third, this reasoning presumes a close correlation between spatial language and spatial thinking–essentially, a (possibly partial) isomorphism between semantics and conceptual structure. (Levinson and Wilkins 2006: 1)
This third point is much stronger than Levinson’s claim some years prior “that we cannot a priori assume any isomorphism between linguistic (semantic) representations and non-linguistic representations […]” (Levinson 2003: 278). With reference to the quote above, I believe that a mediation between Jackendoff’s and Levinson’s approach is called for. So, once more, “some aspects of spatial meaning cannot be expressed linguistically, just as some aspects of language do not correspond to spatial notions” (Peterson, Nadel, Bloom and Garrett 1996: 555). Positing an isomorphism would be going too far at this point of research, but there is an interrelation between conceptual structure and spatial representation, just as Wygotski pointed out some decades ago in his writings on language and cognition in general (Wygotski 1964: 88–110, 255–306).
In Jackendoff’s model this is called “vision” (see Marr 1982, chapters 3–5 on the human visual organization and his 2D and 3D model; Jackendoff 1996: 3, 8). In 1983, Jackendoff also calls for a bridge between a theory of language and theories of “other cognitive capacities such as visual perception and motor control” (Jackendoff 1983: ix). Jackendoff sketches a clear relationship between language and cognition (Jackendoff 1996: 2). He states that “we come at last to the mapping between CS [= conceptual structure; M.T.] and SR [= spatial representation; M.T.], the

crucial link between the visual system and linguistic system” (Jackendoff 1996: 10).
As previously stated, my point of departure is that linguistic and other encoding structures are externalized cognitive representations. This is essentially the fundamental assumption of cognitive linguistics. It maintains that within a culture, linguistic and semiotic decisions are also decisions on how to parse space and apply culture-specific coordinates or reference systems. These linguistic decisions hint at implicit knowledge structures or spatial mental models.27 Levinson and others also exercise caution in the face of such an emphatic assumption and consider the possibility “that culture, through language, affects the way we think” (Gumperz and Levinson 1996: 1, emphasis original; see also Slobin’s “thinking-forspeaking”, 1996: 76).
Different empirical sources are surveyed, not just to enable linguistic, grammatical and other descriptions, but also to include practices which are a form of meaning as language in use (to paraphrase the later Wittgenstein again) or speech acts and joint action (Austin 1962; Bühler 1999; Tomasello 2003, 2008, 2014). Language parallels semiotic accounts, according to Karl Bühler’s pragmatic Sprachtheorie approach28. Different empirical sources are collectively regarded as semiotic representations of spatial cognition externally represented by spoken language, written texts, and actual practices (Bühler 1999; Thiering and Schiefenhövel 2013). This extended understanding of linguistics should come as no surprise considering that the current approach to language, culture, and cognition is bridged by approaches within situated or distributed cognition, or embodiment, enactivism and the extended mind (Gallagher and Schmicking 2010; Marmolejo-Ramos and D’Angiulli 2014; Robbins and Aydede 2010; Zlatev 1997, 2010).29

27 The concept of cognitive maps, rather than coordinate systems in the mathematical sense, could also be used.
28 Bühler’s sign is triadic in the sense that it combines a Sender (transmitter or a speaker), an Empfänger (receiver or hearer), and Gegenstände (things or objects) and Sachverhalte (situations or sets of facts) (Bühler 1999: 28). All three participants are combined in the sign in Bühler’s Organon model of language/speech.
29 Trabant bridges language with embodiment theories stating that language generates or rather creates thought and is embodied thinking: “Sprache die Erzeugung des Gedankens [ist]. Sie ist nicht nur Bezeichnung des ohne Sprache Gedachten und Kommunikation dieses Gedachten an den Anderen mittels des Lauts. Sie ist zuvörderst verkörpertes Denken, in dem Stimme und Begriff, Signifikant und Signifikat als synthetische Einheit die Welt gestalten [...].

1.6 Gestalt theoretical foundations

At the macro level, philosophy, cognition and language meet as equal partners (see Foreword in Malle, Moses and Baldwin 2001). Rohrer states that the most general definition of embodiment is that “the human physical, cognitive, and social embodiment ground our conceptual and linguistic systems” (Rohrer 2007:27).30 I argue that, as semiotic devices, these linguistic symbols derive their meaning solely from their capacity to correspond to things, properties, and relations existing objectively “in the world” (Johnson 1987: xxii).31 These symbols are therefore connected to spatial mental models and are so mediate between the subject’s perception and the cognitive apparatus.

1.6 Gestalt theoretical foundations
At the beginning of this introduction I stated that one basic spatial procedure in everyday life is the process of orientation and navigation on land or at sea. These processes are based on cognitive fundamentals of mental triangulation and gestalt principles, such as figure-ground asymmetries (Metzler 1953). The point of departure for my analysis is the very basic visually based figure-ground distinction seen in gestalt theory. According to gestalt theory, certain gestalt principles apply, including proximity, similarity, good continuation, closure, convexity, exhaustiveness, symmetry, concision (German Prägnanz) and past experiences (as neatly summarized by Pinna 2010). Cognitive contours construe visual anchor points of the respective gestalt (see Kanizsa 1979, especially Chapter 12, and Marr 1982).
Moreover, Pinna concludes that figure-ground relations are specifically determined by surroundedness, size, orientation, contrast, symmetry, convexity and parallelism (and I would add scope, scale and the various stage construals as seen in the choice of frames of reference). Gestalt theory holds that humans constantly construe visually based relationships between a smaller, moveable object related to a larger, often not moving object. The crucial aspect is the ability to notice the different characteris-

tics of a spatial situation or of a speech act, that is, the ability to perceive a gestalt or to see aspects (Aspektsehen, as Wittgenstein calls these constructions). Monk concludes that
[h]uman behavior does not consist in machine-tooled, precise repetitions of a limited repertoire of movements that is invariant between cultures or persons, but rather in irregularities and variations of texture which inflect culturallyrelative paradigms of expressive behavior with a particular physiognomy–an individual style. (Monk 1990: 579)
Theories of perceptual constraints on visual perception and cognition arising from gestalt theory and phenomenological approaches mean that the impact of language and hence symbolic function on the construal of a visual scene is now only partially at issue (Ehrenfels 1890; Jastrow 1899; Koffka 1935; Köhler 1920, 1929; Merleau-Ponty 1974, 1976; Müller-Lyer 1889; Pinna 2010; Rubin 1921; Wertheimer 1923, 1925). This book takes gestalt principles at face value, arguing in favor of a constant interplay between different information cues.
The cognitive linguistic and cognitive semantic approach proposed by Langacker (1987) and Talmy (1978, 1983, 2000) adopts the figure-ground asymmetry (or in Langacker’s technical term, “trajector-landmark”32) and applies it to cognitive linguistic analysis. Broadly speaking, the distinction follows the syntactic division of a sentence into subject and object, but not always (Langacker 1987: 231; see also Cienki 1989: 44–47).
Langacker argues that these asymmetries are staged construals, that is, in perceiving a visual scene human beings instantiate a stage model33. According to this analogy, visual perception can be compared to a theater stage on which different actors and objects are foregrounded based on backgrounded reference frames, and vice versa. These construals depend on scope, scale and other imaging features, as outlined below. These

32 A trajector is a “figure within a relational profile” and a landmark is “a salient substructure other than the trajectory of a relational predication or the profile of a nominal predication” (Langacker 1987: 490, 494). The profile determines the scope of the scene or sets the stage of the scene by introducing the hearer-speaker and the object to be located and the coordinate system, that is, a scene analogue to a stage situation.
33 “A different sort of archetype, the stage model [emphasis M.T.], pertains to how we apprehend the outside world. The term is meant to suggest that the general process is analogous to the special case of watching a play. We cannot see everything at once, so viewing the world requires the directing and focusing of attention. From the maximal field of view, we select a limited area as the general locus of attention (the analog of looking at the stage). Within this region, we focus our attention specifically on certain elements (analogous to actors and props). Of course, we are less concerned with vision as such than with the parallels it exhibits with conception overall (viewing in the broad sense). The stage model does seem broadly applicable. In particular, the maximal field of view, the onstage region, and the focus of attention correspond respectively to an expression’s maximal scope, immediate scope, and profile” (Langacker 2008: 356).

1.6 Gestalt theoretical foundations

staged references anchor the relevant spatial coordinate systems based on relative, intrinsic or absolute frames of reference.
Just as actors move about the stage and handle various props, we tend to organize the scenes we observe in terms of distinct ‘‘participants’’ who interact within an inclusive and reasonably stable ‘‘setting’’. We further impose structure along the temporal axis, by chunking clusters of temporally contiguous interactions (particularly those involving common participants) into discrete ‘‘events’’.
(Langacker 1990: 210)
Prototypically, such relations are mirrored in language as subject and object distinctions on the syntactic level. Figure-ground asymmetries specifically only encode nominals, so here it is important to introduce Langacker’s trajector-landmark asymmetry which is inherently relational.34 This subdomain of figure-ground relations is thus relational in nature.35 As such, it is important to read the chapters concerning these more detailed cognitive semantic distinctions.
With respect to visual perception in the staging process, Pinna argues that
[h]uman perception is more than figural grouping and segmentation, it also extends to the organization of shapes and meanings […]. Each perceptual object is made up of element components grouped and segregated, but further appears as a shape related to other shapes that convey and signify one or more meanings related to other shapes and meanings, thus creating a complex net of perceptual shapes and meanings that is the complex world perceived in everyday life. By perceiving people, cities, houses, cars and trees, we perceive at least three main kinds of organization (forms): grouping/figure-ground segregation, shape and meaning. (Pinna 2010: 12)
This summary of the gestalt theory approach to visual perception shows that the cognitive semantic adaptation proposed by Talmy lacks a number of these important perceptive features. According to Talmy, figure and ground are understood as
[…] the pervasive system by which language establishes one concept as a reference point or anchor for another concept. It posits the existence in language of two fundamental cognitive functions, that of the Figure, performed by the concept that needs anchoring, and that of the Ground, performed by the concept that does the anchoring. (Talmy 2000: 311; emphasis original)

34 With respect to spatial orientation Palmer argues that “[e]very orientational expression necessarily contains in its base of predication a trajectory, a relation, and a landmark” (Palmer 2007: 1064).
35 Langacker argues that “[t]he trajector/landmark distinction is far more general and broadly applicable than the subject/object distinction as this is traditionally understood. […] trajector/landmark alignment pertains to the internal structure of relational predications, at any level of organization. Trajectors and landmarks need not be spelled out overtly, and are often relational (rather than nominal) in character” (Langacker 1987: 232).

I believe that we must return to the original sources of gestalt theory models – Von Ehrenfels, Jastrow, Müller-Lyer, Köhler, Koffka, Rubin, Wertheimer as well as the phenomenological approaches of Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Polany and the later Wittgenstein. This is not meant mere name-dropping, but a call to reread the founders of these schools. In my view these approaches help us in analyzing the various spatial construals used in different languages and cultures, particularly those with a nonwritten tradition.
For the sake of simplicity, I argue (unsurprisingly) that different languages have different strategies for encoding these spatial relationships. There are additional spatial parameters which apply, such as scope, scale and other qualities of figure-ground asymmetries. Some of these additional features form part of Talmy’s qualities of asymmetry (Talmy 2000: 315).

In this language the “Figure’s geometry in spatial description is more complex than the Ground’s” (Senft 1997: 16; see below data on classificatory verb systems in Dene below). Some of the languages presented in this book add further weight to Senft’s claim. Still, Talmy’s qualities of cognitive functions help us analyze linguistic patterns of spatial semantics and to pinpoint the relevant cognitive representational systems. I propose the following imaging parameters based on various previous accounts, in addition to the abovementioned gestalt principles.

This summary of different imaging features captures the fundamental spatial construction patterns in immediate and mediate spatial language and spatial cognition. In addition to contextual knowledge of the speaker/hearer, these imaging features profile the various semantic spatial parameters which languages encode for mediate orientation and spatial relations in general. In terms of the stage analogy above, these imaging patterns help us to zoom in or out the different reference points. Some of these, such as the size and shape of a figure, are implicit structures. Humans do not explicitly compute the different features of objects that might serve as figures. Humans also perceive implicitly different spatial parameters and judge those of importance as being foregrounded or backgrounded. Other aspects remain fuzzy or undetermined. This is only to be

expected as the cognitive apparatus has limited capacity and time to construe a scene. Consequently, spatial mental models encode and store basic information about our environment and encyclopedic knowledge connected to events and the like.
It is worth noting once more that the general purpose is to survey various figure-ground relations, degrees of specificity, toponyms, landmarks, and reference points in various empirical sources to elucidate figure-ground asymmetries in spatial language and spatial cognition. As I and others have already argued, spatial language depends on cognitive information-processing systems of spatial orientation and visual perception (Gibson 1986; Marr 1982).
The next section presents some adaptations of gestalt principles in distributed cognition, that is, a Micronesian means of piloting based on dead reckoning systems, the star compass, so-called etak systems and other semiotic devices.

1.7 Figure-ground asymmetries in action: the case of Micronesian navigation
This section foreshadows the second chapter in which I examine navigation techniques used in cultures without nautical instruments in greater detail. At this point it is important to present some issues on large-scale figure-ground applications. As far as spatial mental models are concerned, an interesting example comes from surveys on orientation on water based on dead reckoning systems, that is, navigation without instruments (Hutchins 1996: 65–93; see also Hutchins 1983; Riesenberg 1972; Sarfert 1911; Schück 1882). This method of navigation requires that one determines one’s position at any given time based on the distance and direction travelled since leaving the last known location (Gladwin 1970: 144).
A navigator monitors the motion of the boat to determine the displacement from a previous position (Hutchins 1996: 56). This mental computing or mental triangulation in space, that is, the transformation and propagation of representational states, is also arguably used on land under specific conditions (Hutchins 1996: 49). In addition to this method, travelers’ reports, stories, symbols, icons, winds, roads and all other types of representation are surveyed to reconstruct spatial mental models of spatial orientation based on implicit and explicit knowledge systems.37

1.7 Figure-ground asymmetries in action: the case of Micronesian navigation

The rationale here is to argue in favor of spatial mental models based on gestalt-like figure-ground representations of spatial cues forming dynamic mental models. This suggests that different knowledge systems of an implicit (tacit knowledge) and explicit nature interact with each other to enable a traveller to find his/her way at sea or in vast terrains such as the mountainous region of the Eipo. As such they are of particular interest in surveying questions regarding universal – rather than culture-specific or historical – spatial encoding patterns. Not surprisingly, different cultures vary in this respect. What may be common to all cultures, and hence universal, is the gestalt-like constructive process of spatial mental models. These spatial mental models function as implicit knowledge systems for spatial orientation which enable people to explicitly navigate in a specific environment.
Humans use various forms of imagery based on visual, auditory and other perceptual systems to perform internal mental processes such as mental rotation (Kosslyn 1980; Shepard and Metzler 1977).38 In mental rotation, objects are virtually translocated or manipulated.
One very specific spatial mental model combining implicit and explicit knowledge is the abovementioned practice of navigation at sea based on cognitive maps as a specific form of mental models seen in Micronesian cultures (see Kuipers 1978, 1982). These practices and cognitive processes are adapted to navigation or piloting techniques on land and as spatial practice at sea.
It is a feature of Micronesian cultures that they don’t use instruments for navigating on open seas. Here, again, I argue that this technique is based on mental gestalt-like cognitive constructions based on various implicit and explicit knowledge cues. In this specific case the implicit cues are based on the construction of a so-called “star compass” (Gladwin 1970; Hutchins 1983, 1996). With reference to Gladwin, Hutchins and others, I argue that these implicit knowledge structures provide information cues in a cognitive process called mental triangulation. This mental triangulation is apparent in the usage of a so-called third, phantom or emergency island (Finney 1991; Gladwin 1970; Goodenough 1953; Oatley 1977; Riesenberg 1972; Sarfert 1911).39 In addition, navigators need to

even use drawings in sand to illustrate various possible positions of the so-called etak. The etak system is explained below. 38 “Interlocuters reconstrue perspectives and fictive orientation by translocating or rotating maps, by zooming in and out, and perhaps even by shrinking or expanding maps” (Palmer 2007: 1064). 39 This mental triangulation is summarized neatly in the following description of the Micronesian navigator’s techniques, which claims that “[w]hen the navigator envisions in his

know a number of islands (50–100 on average), reefs (as seamarks), drifts, winds, wave color and so on. In addition, elders explicitly train younger navigators to empirically accommodate, assimilate and finally equilibrate knowledge systems using a bird’s eye perspective and different frames of reference (Piaget and Inhelder 1956; Thiering and Schiefenhövel 2013). They not only learn a vast number of explicit information cues, but also learn how to mentally represent maps and different routes.
An important feature in orientation is the spatial reference frame. These frames help to orient oneself in different environments (Levinson 2003). This orientation process is based on mental and perceptual course maintaining processes in different cultures which arguably rely on spatial mental models. This means that orientation techniques are processes of inference within the structure of cognitive maps. They are structures of spatial reasoning, which is an activity of unconscious inference (Helmholtz 1867: 576–613). As such, they have the ability to implement spatial knowledge from earlier experiences (see on spatial knowledge Lang, Carstensen, and Simmons 1991). They are instruments of deduction processes in the context of acquired knowledge (Renn and Damerow 2007: 313). They are also context-specific and combine past and present experiences to form cognitive networks. These cognitive networks require both cultural and linguistic knowledge. In the case of orientation, spatial mental models are similar to cognitive maps and these in turn provide mental clues about the traveller’s trajectory in his/her environment.
The trajectory is an image-schema transformation process which involves “mentally traversing the path of a continuously moving object” (Oakley 2007: 217). Cognitively this process can be a summary or sequential scanning mechanism (Langacker 1987: 144–146). The difference in the cognitive processes of summary and sequential scanning is analogous to that between a photo and a motion picture. Both conceptualization processes are based on gestalt-like structures. Summary scanning is additive: “each set of events contributing something to a single configuration all facets of which are conceived as coexistent and simultaneously available” (Langacker 1987: 145). In a footnote Langacker points out that this process is analogous to the fading in or fading out of different aspects of a visual scene, as seen in the stage model. Through perception we focus and direct our attention from one aspect to another (Langacker 1987: footnote

21, p. 145). Sequential scanning involves “the transformation of one configuration into another” (Langacker 1987: 145).40 This book uses different facets to explore the degree to which environmental experience and spatial orientation is reflected in symbolic systems such as spoken and written language, and practices. It also surveys individual or subjective cognitive strategies for aligning mediate figure-ground relations. This brings it in line with current anthropological linguistic approaches which place language and other knowledge systems in their social and cultural contexts, and their cultural practices (Foley 1997; Mark et al. 2011).
[…] the analysis of space concepts and spatial reference in various cultures and languages must consider not only the linguistic context of an utterance but also the paramount cultural context in which such an utterance is produced and adequately understood. (Senft 1997: 22)
As such, spatial knowledge is not only encoded in mental concepts and categories, but is embodied in the lived histories of human beings, and their cultural and linguistic practices as encoded in texts and maps (Foley 1997: 177; Johnson 1987). I adopt the following premise which argues that
[…] descriptions of space, or allusions to space in language, must rest on two kinds of knowledge. The first appears to be based on models (maps, representations) which people construct to guide spatial behavior. The second appears to consist of a linguistic symbol-system that allows the models to be shared within a community of discourse. (Siegel and White 1975: 11; emphasis original)
This question concerns the relationship between non-linguistic information and spatial language, that is, environmental landmarks such as rivers, mountains, trees, winds, and the medium (time, distance, measurement data) between landmarks. The commonly accepted argument is that nonlinguistic information has an impact on spatial language and categorization, i.e., reference to space and its relation to other semiotic systems. From those very general aspects, the following section focuses on lexicalsemantics of spatial encoding decisions.
1.8 Lexical-semantic encoding patterns of spatial cognition: geometrical idealizations
Most of the research on spatial relations has been carried out on spatial markers such as adpositions. Languages differ fundamentally in the mor-

phosyntactic and semantic devices used in categorizing figure-ground relationships. For example, most Germanic languages use adpositions such as ‘at’, ‘on’, ‘in’ in English or an, auf, in in German, and posture verbs such as ‘sitting’, ‘standing’, ‘lying’ to denote staged relations, while in agglutinative languages, case – such as the absolutive, adessive and allative – encodes directions.
In the following, some simple cases of geometric prepositions and their rule systems are presented (see Miller and Johnson-Laird 1976: 378– 398; Vandeloise 1991 presents an overview). It is important to have an overview of the research on geometric and spatial relations, largely carried out in the fields of linguistics and cognitive linguistics (see also Bennett 1968, 1972; Cienki 1989; Cooper 1968; Herskovits 1985, 1986; Svorou 1993; Lakoff 1987a; Leech 1969; Tyler and Evans 2003). All of these analyses essentially single out English locatives (with the exception of Cienki, who adds Polish and Russian, and Svorou’s description of spatial grams in a number of languages) that arguably bear the geometrical and spatial information of the respective object to be related to.41 An exception is Svorou who argues in favor of so-called “spatial grams” which cover diverse spatial encoding mechanisms in different languages (26 genetically different languages). Note that in most linguistic descriptions prepositions are defined as grammatical function words with little semantic content.
The prototypical English prepositions for simple geometric relations are ‘at’, ‘on’ and ‘in’. ‘In’ and ‘on’ can be described as follows: the preposition ‘in’ profiles an area or volume containing a location between a figure and a ground. The preposition ‘on’ focuses on the reference object (ground) that supports the object whose location is to be indicated, which is the figure. Other prepositions, such as ‘near’, ‘over’, ‘beside’ and ‘beneath’ profile the direction in which an object lies with respect to a reference object. On the other hand, ‘from here’, ‘over us’, ‘left of you’, ‘in front of me’ are deictic systems which refer to the speaker. Bennett (1972)

41 “Existing approaches to the semantic analysis of locative particles (e.g. English spatial prepositions) presuppose a local semantics for these lexemes. That is, it is assumed that the semantic content which they bear is distributed paradigmatically over the single form-class. To put it more simply, it is assumed that spatial relational meaning [...] is carried by the locative particle, and only by the locative particle. This is, by definition, the basic assumption of all kinds of contrastive analysis, since contrastively-derived meaning components postulated for, e.g., prepositions, are components of prepositional meaning, and not of the meanings of other form classes. Indeed, the localist assumption, as applied to locative particle meaning, is simply a generalization from the traditional approach to lexical semantics which derives features from contrastive analysis.” (Sinha and Kuteva 1995: 167)

The figure-ground relation varies according to the object’s constraints, that is, the locative in can only be used to a certain point. In 1968, Cooper expands this simple rule system using specific constraints.

tive to y and y is not a geopolitical area

The constraints are more specific with respect to the geometrical complexities of the figure. The ground’s variation in size or material also influences the figure-ground asymmetry; see also Leech (1969) rule systems in Table 5.

42 “Topological distinctions between spatial entities are a fundamental aspect of spatial knowledge. Topological distinctions are inherently qualitative which makes them particularly interesting for qualitative spatial reasoning. […] Topological approaches to qualitative spatial reasoning usually describe relationships between spatial regions rather than points, where spatial regions are subsets of some topological space” (Renz and Nebel 2007: 170).

Here geometric properties profile the figure-ground asymmetry as seen in the following English examples.

(1) Figure-ground examples profiled by the locative of ‘in’:
a. A city in Sweden. b. The coffee in the cup. c. The spoon in the cup. d. The scratch in the surface. e. The bone in the leg.
Underlying all these uses of ‘in’ is a concept that Bennett refers to as “interior”, Cooper as “internal location”, and Leech as “enclosure/containment” (see Pederson, Wilkins and Bowerman 1998 on topological relations and their qualities, including containment).
Miller and Johnson-Laird having brought the above formal systems of geometrical relations to a conclusion, the prototypical schema for all usages of ‘in’ is:
in (x,y) = a referent x is in a relatum y if: [part(x,y) & inclusion(z,y)]
A figure is in a ground if (and only iff) one part of it is included by the ground.43 Now consider the preposition on in the following examples (Miller and Johnson-Laird 1976: 386).
(2) Figure-ground examples profiled by the locative ‘on’:
a. The house on the river. b. The scratch on the surface. c. The label on the box. d. The picture on the wall. e. The rug on the floor. f. The table on the rug (on the floor). g. The lamp on the table (on the rug on the floor).
The ground or reference objects (except in 2a) seem to be the different static surfaces, the subdomain for profiling the figure-ground asymmetry
"""""""""""""!
43 Herskovits presents a similar rule system based on Cooper and Miller and Johnson-Laird: In(X,Y) iff Included (Part(X),Y). X is in Y if and only if a part of X is spatially included in Y (Herskovits 1985: 342). For the preposition ‘on’ she states that “[f]or some prepositions, we have to allow for ambiguity. So for ‘on’, at least two meanings are needed, one for three-dimensional examples, like the book on the desk: On,(X,Y) iff Contiguous(X,Y) and Support(Y,X) and one for two-dimensional examples like the house on the lake: On,(X,Y) iff Contiguous(X, Boundary(Y))” (Herskovits 1985: 343).

is the region of the surface of the figure. The region profiles the domain, that is, to say x at y is to say that x is included in the region of y = reg (w,y) (w = region of possible (perceptual) predicate with y). In simple terms, observers construe the abovementioned (theatrical) stage with foregrounded and backgrounded cognitive concepts in idealized situations. Based on the relevant spatial relations which are to encompass the scope of the staged situations, different locatives profile different geometrical conditions. The locatives ‘on’ and ‘at’ in English require the following presuppositions:

Table 6. Rule systems for topological relations in English

Relation

= a referent (FIGURE) x is on a relatum (GROUND) y if:

b. at (x,y) (i) (ii)

= a referent x is at a relatum y if: INCLUSION(x, REGION(y)) ! (INCLUSION(y,REGION(x))

It has been argued that all of these geometrical descriptions seem to work for most Germanic languages in an idealized fashion, whereas most of the American Indian and First Nation languages and the Papuan language presented here use classificatory verb systems, while the Mesoamerican language Upper Necaxa Totonac refers above all to body-part constructions, and/or a mixture of various encoding systems (see below for different examples). These systems add more semantic detail or degree of specificity to the respective spatial situation.
Of course, we also see certain semantic granularity implicitly encoded in Germanic languages. Take the following example of the spatial relation between chewing gum and a table. In German the chewing gum is, or sticks under, the table (Der/das Kaugummi ist/klebt unterm Tisch.). Using the existential verb sein ‘to be’ in a different situation shows that also in German semantic granularity is encoded. Die Schuhe sind/stehen unterm Tisch (‘The shoes are/are standing under the table’) encodes a certain spatial distance between the figure and the ground. Chewing gum is in a direct contact relation to the ground whereas shoes are canonically at a certain distance from the reference object. This shows that in German, extralinguistic knowledge is added even in simple spatial situations. Moreover, German posture verbs also encode figure-specific qualities since only certain objects can stick to a ground. It goes without saying that

Chapter 1: Setting the stage

39

these are idealized situations. The shoes could be in a more direct relation to the table if the table has an upper drawer, but they would rarely stick to the table directly (maybe in an art exhibition). Berthele highlights this very simple objection to linguistic exceptions or peculiarities in First Nation and other languages (Berthele 2006). As Berthele (personal communication) rightly points out, even in typologically close languages such as English, German and the Scandinavian languages, spatial adpositions differ drastically in their spatial semantics (see also Becker 1994).
With respect to geometrical spatial relations this book follows Lewin’s definition of linguistic spatial topology, regarded
[…] as the most general science of spatial relations, [which] can be based on the relationship between ‘part’ and ‘whole’ or in other words on the concepts of ‘being-included-in’. Closely related to these concepts is that of the ‘surrounding’ of a ‘point’. [...] Topologically there is no difference between a circle, an ellipse, a regular or irregular polygon with any number of sides. [...] [L]ikewise, there is no difference between a sphere, a cube, cylinder, and a cone. Differences in size are also disregarded in topology. (Lewin 1936: 87–88)
Lewin’s gestalt psychology approach to topological relations has specific parallels to Köhler. In particular, the part-whole relationship cited resembles the figure-ground asymmetry introduced above (see Fiorini, Gärdenfors and Abel 2015; Pinna 2010). Topological relations are based on Euclidean geometry.44 It is a mathematical construction that fails as a description of reality. Using this definition of topological relation on languages it is evident that in English (and most Germanic and Romance languages), for example, such relations are expressed by prepositions.
Pederson et al. (1998: 1) point out that topological relations must fulfill certain characteristics. In terms of the figure-ground asymmetry, these features include +/–contact, +/–inclusion, +/–adjacent and functional relations such as +/–support and +/–containment (see Herskovits 1986; Svorou 1993; Vandeloise 1991). In addition to these features, the range of prototypically assumed topological relations is summarized in Table 7 in accordance with Miller and Johnson-Laird (1976: 380–391) and Svorou (1994: 128–155). This table concludes the rule systems introduced above.

44 One of the major struggles in accounting for finite and abstract spaces is Euclid’s parallel axiom. He claims that a point X on a line A that is parallel to a line B can never meet a point Y on line B in a finite space. In the 18th century, Carl Friedrich Gauss, János Bolyai and Nikolai Iwanowitsch Lobatschewski, among others, developed an alternative to Euclidean geometry (see Jammer 1954; Nerlich 1994a,b; Ray 1991; Reichenbach 1958; Sklar 1974).

This table presents four relational situations between a figure and a ground aligned by a locative marker, that is, ‘in’, ‘on’, ‘at’, and ‘near’. Different locative markers are chosen depending on the particular alignment between the figure and ground.
Herskovits presents elementary spatial concepts as “ideal meaning” (Herskovits 1986: 55). She discusses five spatial concepts: (1) topological, (2) geometrical, (3) physical, (4) projective and (5) metric. According to Herskovits, topological relations are represented in English by prepositions such as ‘at’, ‘on’, and ‘in’ (dimensionality), or ‘across’ and ‘through’ (boundedness) (see Miller and Johnson-Laird 1976). The preposition ‘on’ encodes a relation of contiguity with line or surface, ‘at’ encodes the coincidence of two points, and so on. The alignment with direction is encoded via ‘over’ and ‘under’, and vertical directions are encoded via ‘above’ and ‘below’. Projective relations behind’, ‘in front of’ and ‘to the right/left’. Finally, metric relations are distances expressed via ‘near’ or ‘close to’. All these prepositions encode ideal meanings of a “geometrical ideal”

(Herskovits 1986: 56). These are therefore rather idealized formulas which only capture the semantics of a locative morpheme.
The rule systems introduced above are idealizations for the proposed figure-ground asymmetries in the languages under review. While these systems only partially apply to the specific languages and grammars in this book, they provide a good point of departure for spatial analysis. Again, these systems imply idealized situations in vision and language. Consequently, the degree of specificity of semantic detail and the selection of gestalt principles shifts significantly between languages and cultures46. This implies that the rule systems in fact only partially apply and require fundamental semantic expansions as presented in the imaging parameters.
This book tends not to reduce spatial relations to rule-governed systems or even syllogisms based purely on a simple spatial morpheme, rather it digs deeper into the intricacies of spatial semantics in concert with other cognitive and cultural systems. Some of these linguistic specificities are presented in the next section.

1.9 The languages of mountainous and prairie regions
The primary comparison here is that between Eipomek (in short: Eipo) and a Northern Athapaskan polysynthetic language, Dene Chipewyan (in short: Dene) which represent two unrelated and distinct cultures located in very different parts of the world (there is an additional focus on Upper Necaxa Totonac, Mexico). Eipo is spoken in the central mountains of Papua province, Indonesia, on the island of New Guinea which also includes the country Papua New Guinea. Dene is spoken in the prairie of Cold Lake, Alberta (Canada). These cultures represent contrasting environmental conditions and different development histories (Eipomek was relatively isolated until the 1970s, Dene was suppressed by white settlers as during the colonization of First Nations territory in Canada). The two groups contrast sharply in language, genetics and culture. The Dene have always been hunters and gatherers, while the Eipo live in hut settlements and cultivate fields. All of these factors make the two languages good candidates for comparison. A detailed look at the different languages and cultures is presented in the respective chapters below.

1.9 A sketch of the grammars

1.9 A sketch of the grammars

This chapter provides a brief introduction to the three grammars of the languages under review, starting with Dene followed by Upper Necaxa Totonac and Eipomek (data from Eipo is presented in the penultimate chapter). The focus is primarily on spatial encoding devices such as classificatory verbs, posture verbs, and body parts.

1.9.1 Dene Chipewyan
The Dene Cold Lake dialect is an endangered Athapaskan language spoken by about 2000 speakers in the subarctic region of Canada (Thiering 2009a). It is closely related to Slave, Beaver, Sekani and Dogrib, as well as its better-known cousin Navajo (see Hoijer 1951 on Navajo). There are only about 200 speakers who use the language on a daily basis and who can be classified as fluent speakers.
The typical Dene verb is polysynthetic and fusional in its morphology. The language features a predominant, consistent classificatory verb system which includes adverbial and directional prefixes as well as a postpositional inventory (see Li 1946; McDonough 2000; S. Rice 2002 on the general structure of the Athapaskan verb stem system). Such verbs have different morphological forms depending on the physical characteristics of the object to be encoded. This means that stems change with respect to shape, animacy and/or physical features of the object being located or handled, as well as the number of participants and distance (S. Rice 2002b: 69).
Cook argues that Dene has about 36 postpositions that morphologically function like nouns. They inflect with pronominal prefixes (Cook 2004: 92). Cook also points out that the determination of a postposition’s meaning is as difficult as it is in English or any other language. This means it is often impossible to determine the precise meaning from the context (see Herskovits 1985). However it is widely acknowledged that these postpositional prefixes modify the meaning of the verb stem (S. Rice and Wood 1996).
The general focus here is on the motivation of certain semantic construction types and the encoding of figure-ground asymmetry as modified by the verbal cohort.
Making a choice from an appropriate set of verb stems has the effect of assigning the noun in the sentence certain qualities of number, shape, texture or purpose. If these qualities are semantically inappropriate to the

Chapter 1: Setting the stage

43

noun, another verb stem must be used. (Carter 1976: 24; see also S. Rice 1997: 103ff.)
All Athapaskan languages exhibit an alternation of verb themes that is traditionally known as “classificatory”. Classificatory themes describe the nature of an object handled with respect to parameters such as extension and dimension. The verb theme indicates the nature of the object being handled while the type of activity involved is expressed in the prefixes (K. Rice 1989: 779).
These stems profile existential situations or actions of certain categories of objects (Davidson et al. 1963). Table 8 summarizes the four classificatory verb categories.

Table 8. The different classificatory verbs47

1. Posture or locative verbs
2. Verbs of handling, manipulation, continuing manual contact
3. Verbs of partially controlled action (+ agent) 4. Verbs of free movement, independent of agent

no movement involved, e.g., sit, stand, lie, be in position/location e.g., give, hand, take, put, handle, bring, carry
e.g., toss, throw, hang up, set down, drop, lose, push over
e.g., fall/tip over

An example of how a particular stem (‘to give’) changes according to the quality of the figure is presented in Table 9. The data indicates the change of verb stem according to the actual object transferred from one person to another.

‘I gave animate being to him/her.’ ‘I gave round/hard object to him/her.’ ‘I gave sticklike object to him/her.’ ‘I gave flat object to him/her.’ ‘I gave plural objects to him/her.’ ‘I gave open container to him/her.’ ‘I gave unspecified object to him/her.’

"""""""""""""!
47 The Table is based on S. Rice (1997: 103; 2002) and also Cook 1986; Davidson et al. (1963).
48 The parsed morphemes have the following grammatical functions: be- = 3person.singular.subject; -gha- = ‘to’; -n- = momentaneous; -i- = 1person.singular.subject; ! - = classifier (Dene has 4 classifiers: the zero, -d-, -!-, and -l-. markers These classifiers profile the transitivity of the verb.) The underlined morpheme is the respective classificatory verb stem.

44

1.9 A sketch of the grammars

According to the above examples, the Dene verb stem changes with respect to the quality of the object to be encoded. Hence, the figure’s characteristics such as shape, size, and the (in)animacy of the object determine the choice of verb stems.
As stated above, the Dene verb is regarded as polysynthetic. It also has fusional characteristics in its morphology, with a rich prefix system. The usual word order is SOV, but the Dene verb also has a propositional character, that is, subject and object prefixes are fused within the verb (S. Rice 2002: 66ff.). According to traditional accounts, the Dene verb consists of a verb theme (the basic lexical entry made up of a stem and one or more thematic prefixes) and additional prefixes (Li 1946; S. Rice and Wood 1996; K. Rice 2000). Table 10 shows a general schema of the Dene verb plus stem pattern. Table 11 provides explanations of prefix abbreviations.

(Li 1946; McDonough 2000; S. Rice 2002; see also Kari 1989)

McDonough divides the verbal complex into a bipartite structure in which the positions 1–4 are the satellites, and the positions 5–10 are defined as stem positions (McDonough 2000; K. Rice 2000). The list in Table 11 summarizes the single positions in more detail.

(Li 1946; McDonough 2000)

The positions 1–4 (= disjunctive prefixes) and 5–6 (= pronominal subjects/objects) are part of the disjunct or lexical zone and have derivational functions. The positions 7–10 are termed the conjunct or grammatical zone and include obligatory inflectional categories such as tense, aspect, modality, subject agreement and valency (Li 1946: 409). Classifiers encode

Chapter 1: Setting the stage

45

the transitivity of the verb (Broschart 1997). They denote the valency of the verb.
It is argued that Dene provides semantic information in a way that is not aligned with lexical units or parts of speech in a specific morphosyntactic order, but in a more scattered fashion in which the semantic load is distributed throughout the phrase (Thiering 2007; Zlatev 1997). Consequently, the template above is merely an idealized categorization into discrete morphemes. This assumption is in line with Li’s very insightful sketch of Dene grammar. Li claims that the Dene verb “is a complicated structure, consisting of a stem and a number of prefixes” (Li 1946: 404). Furthermore, he states that it is not possible to parse verbs into prefix and stem, for example, to determine the meaning. For instance, the verb ‘to dream’ is com-posed of the prefix ná- and the stem -te. The former means something like ‘here and there, about’ and the latter ‘a living being lies around’. Li argues that parsing náste ‘I dream’ into its components does not result in the English understanding of dreaming from the morpheme’s meanings alone. Here Li foreshadows constructon grammar approaches that analyze not isolated chunks of meanings.

1.9.2 Upper Necaxa Totonac
Upper Necaxa Totonac (UNT), spoken by about 3000 in East-Central Mexico is a morphologically complex agglutinative language featuring particularly rich inflectional markings of the verb (the following summary is based on Beck’s insightful grammar of UNT, Patla-Chicontla Totonac, 2004). The location of Totonac
outside the Necaxa Valley is spectacular, featuring high, steep cliffs and deep, narrow river gorges. Some of the peaks in the area rise over 1,500 m., but the Upper Necaxa villages themselves sit on the valley floor at only 260 m. above sea-level. The differences in altitude result in stark contrasts in climate. The lower altitudes have a hot, humid costal climate with average day time temperatures in the high 20s or low 30s, while the higher communities have cooler weather and frequently experience dense fogs and temperatures below 20 degrees. (see: http://www.artsrn.ualberta.ca/totonaco/Landscape.html; last access August 2014).
Beck argues that UNT has a tendency toward VSO word order, but that the sentence structure is highly flexible, that is, that SO or OS are possible as well (Beck 2004: 92). Verb stems are inflected for subject and object agreement. There are four aspects (imperfective, perfective, perfect, and progressive) and three tenses: present (not marked), past (prefix i!-) and future (marked by the prefix na-). Verbs in UNT are divided into two

46

1.9 A sketch of the grammars

major aspectual inflection classes, active and stative verbs. Stative verbs have only imperfective and inchoative forms, whereas active verbs inflect four aspectual categories: imperfective, perfective, perfect, and progressive. As Beck points out, the complexity of verbal morphology in Totonac is striking (Beck 2004). In addition to inflection for person and number of syntactic arguments, verbs are marked for a variety of tenses and aspectual categories, as well as for three moods. UNT also has a wide range of valency-altering morphemes, including a variety of causatives and applicatives. As in other Totonacan languages, body parts are frequently incorporated into verb stems as prefixes, performing a wide range of grammatical functions (see table below; also on body parts Levy 1992).
Finally, Totonac has a number of quasi-inflectional affixes expressing a range of adverb-like meanings, and it makes use of deverbalizing morphemes to form participle-like expressions from transitive and intransitive verbs.
Totonac, too, has a wide range of valency-altering affixes including two causatives and four applicatives. In addition, the language is notable for its lack of prepositions and its extensive use of body part prefixes on verbs to form locative expressions and to localize the affected parts of event-participants, in many cases increasing the basic valency of the stem. Body parts (and posture verbs) are of special interest in this survey since they encode spatial relations in addition to posture verbs and adpositions. The prefixation of body parts resembles noun incorporation, but only special prefixing combining forms of body part roots may be incorporated. When these roots are incorporated, they serve to delimit the verb’s locus of effect, that is, they indicate which part of the subject or object is affected by the action.
Body parts referred to here include ear, shin, leg, mouth, back, nose, breast, chest, face, hand, finger, arm, abdomen, vagina, buttocks, anus, foot, knee. See the following Table 12 for examples.

1.9 A sketch of the grammars

Totonac establishes body part metonymic extensions for spatial grounding with the human body as an anchor, e.g., the human ear for a cup handle or the mouth for the rim of a cup. The selected data sets below show the usage of some of the above body part extensions. It will also be apparent that speakers choose different encoding patterns to focus on different spatial alignments and regions.

1.9.3 Eipomek
Subject-object-verb order predominates in the Eipo language (Heeschen 1998: 286). Note that Heeschen also claims that Eipo is a noun-plus-verb language, which implies that another noun is essentially treated as a free unit, that is, associated constituents move freely around this basic unit (Heeschen 1998: 268). The subject role is filled by a human agent (Heeschen 1998: 286). Object-subject-verb structures are also frequently used. Compounding is the main source for denoting or construing word meaning. Nouns are not inflected and not morphologically marked (Heeschen 1998: 197). They are morphologically simple and case marking is pragmatically handled, i.e., the actual discourse marks subject and object of a sentence or situation. In transitive propositions, the noun is profiled as the direct object, things and living beings are acted upon, they undergo actions, manipulation and creation by human beings (Heeschen 1998: 197). Gender is profiled through compounding and derivation, e.g., using yim for ‘male’ or kil for ‘female’ to classify the noun if required (Heeschen 1998: 200); in normal speech gender is not specified in verb conjugation.
Number is expressed either by context or via the verb morphology. Nouns are modified by adjectives (Heeschen 1998: 210). More specifically, adjectives denote dimension, distance and position in geographical and social space (Heeschen 1998: 211). They also denote color, age, value, and properties of human beings, animals, plants and objects. The class of adverbs profiles verbs, adjectives, pronouns, adverbs and sentences (Heeschen 1998: 215).
Eipo differentiate between various adverb types such as temporal (‘day’, ‘time’), local (‘down there’, ‘in the middle’, ‘in the direction of’; see list of terms for spatial deixis below) and modal adverbs, degree adverbs (‘very’), and focus or conjunctional adverbs (‘also’, ‘too’). Verbs denote actions and processes (Heeschen 1998: 223). In contrast with nouns, which prototypically profile landmarks and objects located in space, verbs denote motion events between such landmarks, actions, processes, or conditions (Bußmann 2008: 773). Verbs designate a process unfolding in

Chapter 1: Setting the stage

49

conceived time (Langacker 1987: 244). Langacker calls a verb a “symbolic expression” whose semantic pole (a symbolic structure consists of a semantic and a phonological pole) profiles a process (Langacker 1987: 244). The quote below summarizes the idea of a process in connection with the verb as a symbolic expression unfolding in time.
A process is defined as a sequence of configurations (states) conceived as being distributed over a continuous series of points in time. Usually the separate configurations are distinct, i.e. a verb typically designates a change through time; a normal verbal predication is therefore highly complex, for it incorporates as many separate conceptual situations as there are recognizable different states in the designated process. (Langacker 1987: 143–144)
In Eipo, verbs are bound morphemes profiling various processes such as aspect and tense, but also person, number, and mood (Heeschen 1998: 223). The morphemes are suffixed to the verb. Syntactically, verbs profile predicates, and person-number suffixes agree with the subject noun phrase (NP). Note that NPs in Eipo can be constructed based on a noun or a pronoun (Heeschen 1998: 265). This grammatical suffixation represents a parallel to Eipo proper nouns which can take suffixes for human beings indicating gender (Heeschen 1998: 200). Here it is also important to mention that number of nouns is inferred from either the context or profiled by the verb’s morphology and its respective suffix.
Just as Dene uses various slots left of the verb stem as seen in the text and template above, so too does Eipo motivate a sequence of bound morphemes: +stem, +/-tense/aspect, +/-object pronouns, +tense/mood /person/number (Heeschen 1998: 223).
The stem without a final consonant is called a “root” (Young and Morgan 1987). Such roots can fill the abovementioned slots such as tense, person, or number suffixes. More interesting is the lexicalization process of compound verbs. This process of the formation of lexical units (as opposed to grammar) is a characteristic typological feature of Mek languages (Heeschen 1998: 231). Heeschen argues that in Eipo most of the (last order) stems are verbs profiling movement in space, such as position( ‘to sit’ or ‘to stand/stay’), that is, they behave like posture verbs (Heeschen 1998: 231, 234).
The Eipo language consists of six tense-aspect suffixes and six sets of tense-mood-person-number suffixes (Heeschen 1998: 246). With respect to tense-aspect, the Eipo language distinguishes today’s past (PAST.I), near past (PAST.II) and remote past (PAST.III). The same tripartite distinction is found in the future aspect, that is, immediate (FUT.I), near (FUT.II), and far future (FUT.III) (Heeschen 1998: 257; see Heeschen’s Table 47 for an overview of tense-mood-person-number suffixes).

1.9 A sketch of the grammars

A typical structure for Papuan languages in general is the classification system, or object-dependent grammatical marking via the verb (Heeschen 1998; Wurm 1982; see also Senft 2000). It is argued that the Eipo language does not feature a classificatory noun/verb system. Heeschen (personal communication) argues that Eipo also has a tendency to classification, but that it is relatively weak and not comparable to the other Papuan languages, or to Dene.
The nominal system not only encodes gender, but also relies heavily on the different verb roots encoding particular features of the object. Foley provides an example taken from Waris, a Papuan language spoken in Sandaun province, Papua New Guinea, in which morphemes are prefixed to the verbs encoding objects found inside a container (vela), spherical objects (put-), food cooked and distributed in leaf wrappers (ninge-), leaf-like objects with soft or non-existent stem (lé), leaf-like objects with a hard stem (pola-), and so on (Foley 1986: 95). As outlined above, in Dene various verbs encode different characteristics of the relative object, that is, verbs of handling, manipulation, continuing manual contact, including ‘give’, ‘hand’, ‘take’, ‘put’, ‘handle’, ‘bring’, ‘carry’. Foley calls these verbs transfer control/position of something (Foley 1986: 115). Dene also has verbs of partially controlled action including an agent, (‘toss’, ‘throw’, ‘hang up’, ‘set down’, ‘drop’, ‘lose’) and verbs of free movement that are independent of an agent (‘fall’, ‘tip over’) (Cook 2004; Thiering 2006, 2009b). This system enables the language user to profile exactly the semantic features of the object to be encoded.
This is also interesting with respect to spatial morphemes used in the delimitation of spatial relations. In Eipo, Dene, and Totonac specifically, it is not just important to carefully single out the spatial dimension, but also the aspectual point of view. It should be noted that in Eipo, an independent verb is in the final position and is inflected for person, tense and number of the subject. It has been noted that Papuan languages have a complex morphology, especially in the verb. Moreover, the morphology features agglutinative patterns. The complexity of the verb makes the language an especially interesting comparison with First Nation languages of the Americas, such as Dene (Thiering 2009a), Hopi (Malotki 1979, 1983), Navajo (Young and Morgan 1987), and Slavey (K. Rice 1989). These are all supposedly polysynthetic languages, i.e., words are based on bounded morphemes that have concrete meanings (Boas 1997: 74, 79 and especially with Upper Necaxa Totonac spoken in Mexico (Beck 2004). Indeed, Boas claims that

Chapter 1: Setting the stage

51

a large number of distinct ideas are amalgamated by grammatical processes and form a single word, without any morphological distinction between the formal elements in the sentence and the contents of the sentence. (Boas 1997: 74)
Cook notes that in contrast to noun stems, verb stems alone cannot constitute a word (Cook 2004: 58). He claims that the internal structure of a verb is equivalent to a full sentence in English (Cook 2004: 86).
The next example from Eipo presents the fine-grained structure of aspectual marking (Heeschen 1998: 143). It presents a typical deictic construction using the deictic morpheme a- ‘here’.

(3)

Aik a-bu-lam-se,

bai

a-ba-lam-se.

hut here-sit-HAB-1SG.PAST.III, outside from/here-go-HAB-1SG.PAST.III

‘I lived in this hut, I was going from here into the forest.’

As mentioned above, Eipo divides the past tense into three stages49: PAST I = today’s past PAST II = near past PAST III = remote past
The speaker of the quoted phrase, first person singular, explains that s/he lived in a specific house serving also as the point of departure for several trips into the farmed land and the forest. The deictic marker relies on the speaker’s intended orientation in which ‘here’ denotes close proximity.
This might be a good point to consult the grammatical descriptions on Dene, Totonac and Eipo throughout the relevant chapters. The important aspects of the data are the different encoding patterns which rely on a variety of imaging parameters. Consequently a broad understanding of the grammars will suffice for following the relevant points of argumentation.

1.10 Structure of the book
First and foremost, this collection of papers presents qualitative studies on the language-cognition interface based on visual perception processes of figure-ground construals. Although there is some numerical data, the detailed descriptions tend to be cognitive-semantic qualitative descriptions rather than formal-logical accounts. I have used a number of empirical sources, from various elicitation tools to ethnological grammars and ethnological film recordings of real-life practices such as building a house, a

bridge or a trap in Eipo. These elicitation tools are all visually based. Some were developed by the Max Planck Institute Nijmegen, and one is the property of the author and the Daghida project of the Cold Lake dialect of Dene (University of Alberta, Department of Linguistics).
The selection of former publications was largely based on the very first elicitation tool. Although I have also published on other tools, there is a critical problem with them, or rather access to speakers. As Dene and Totonac are both endangered languages, it is difficult to find fluent speakers. Consequently I ran all tests with the same speakers. This is a drawback simply because of a task effect which taints the results of the follow-up studies (that is, the Caused Position task, the Motion Event task, the Motion Land task and the Spatial Categorization Elicitation task). I have chosen chapters which together represent a unified whole on the interrelation between cognition and culture.
The book is divided into three main parts. Following this introduction a chapter on theoretical issues follows that establish the analytical ground for the chapters to come. The second part presents different case studies, largely based on the two languages Dene and Totonac with additional examples from Germanic and Romance languages as well as a case study on spatial semantic loss in Dene. The third part introduces environmental landmarks as spatial coordinates in Dene and Eipo. Overall, the book starts out with highly detailed analysis of spatial semantics and spatial cognition to later broaden out to the level of environmental landmarks and toponyms or, in other words, from immediate to mediate spatial encodings and visual perception. The chapters are written such that they can be read sequentially or individually, on the understanding that they all relate to a larger framework of spatial semantics and spatial cognition.
Each chapter has been previously published as a peer-reviewed article. However what follows are excerpts from these articles which I have altered extensively so that they better conform to the overall structure of the book. Technical terms used in the book are listed at the beginning. All of this serves to give the book a coherent structure and common thread. Note also that one chapter is from a paper coauthored with Wulf Schiefenhövel. The following provides an outline of the different chapters.
Following the general introduction and theoretical outline, the second chapter, “Cognitive Representation of Knowledge: Spatial Mental Models”, serves as an introduction to spatial mental models (formerly entitled “Spatial Mental Models in Common Sense Geography”). It is concerned with implicit or tacit knowledge of spatial orientation as ethnogeographic knowledge based on cognitive maps. It takes visual perception at face

value, implementing abstract cognitive mental models as cognitive representation of implicit knowledge systems in orientation, specifically in navigation on land and at sea. Internal representation of implicit knowledge structures is only partially represented in language. I argue that mental models are dynamic systems of representation. As such, I survey different systems of spatial orientation as described in language and culture in different geographic areas. Moreover, physical geographic parameters, or landmarks, are required for anchoring salient geographic concepts in landscape orientation (Duvall 2011: 121; Mark et al. 2011; Golledge and Rushton 1976).
The third chapter, “Figure-Ground Reversals in Language”, is concerned with one of the major questions in spatial semantics, namely the place and role of meaning in perception. The chapter addresses that question with respect to the role of meaning in spatial semantics and its figureground alignments (see Zlatev 2007 on spatial semantics). The issue is congruent linguistic patterns of figure-ground reversals, that is, cognitive features of salience or reference that can be redistributed from primary to secondary image features. This refers to a participant construed as foregrounded (being canonically the figure or trajector) as opposed to more backgrounded anchorage (the expected ground or landmark) and its reversed patterns. This widely known concept of gestalt psychology is not limited to visual processes, but also applies to linguistic encoding patterns. This is illustrated through a selected sample of languages.
I argue that reversal patterns illustrate the human capacity for constructing and relating objects in space which relies not only on objectively given features, but also (inter)subjective encoding decisions. The hypothesis is that the parallels between language and cognition indicate a bridging element between those levels of human conceptual organization. This element can be found in embodied cognition or situated embodiment, assumed as a crucial mediator between the two information levels (Johnson 1987; Lakoff 1987a, Chapters 12 and 13 in particular; Langacker 2008; Robbins and Aydede 2009; Rohrer 2007; Zlatev 1997, 2003, 2010). The various visually based elicitation tools used in approaching this issue are presented in this chapter. These results indicate figure-ground reversals in spatial semantics and hence some subjective encoding decisions.
This chapter presents data from perceptual elicitation tools used on a variety of languages with non-written traditions. As it happens, so-called figure-ground relations are very often linguistically reversed from their expected alignments and do not follow perceptual or objectively given cues (see Dokic and Pacherie 2006: 268 on the differences between perceptual and linguistic spatial representations). Perception does indeed

54

1.10 Structure of the book

consist of more than just figural grouping; it also extends to the formation of shapes and linguistic meaning. This is an interesting point when considering the relationship between language, cognition, and perception in general. Where linguistic figure-ground reversals are found one may claim that visual perception is only partially reflected in language (and hence in frames of reference; see Dokic and Pacherie 2006 for an extensive discussion of the relationship between frames of reference involved in nonlinguistic spatial representation, with a focus on perception). I will also show that the decision to encode a figure or a ground in a particular scene depends on the speaker’s choice of what s/he regards as foregrounded or backgrounded. This leads to a mismatch between the given gestalt and the linguistic encoding pattern.
The fourth chapter on “Degrees of Specificity in Spatial Semantics” presents a cognitive semantic synopsis of spatial topological semantics and, to a lesser degree, frames of reference. The focus is on Dene, and Upper Necaxa Totonac, the agglutinative language spoken in East-Central Mexico. The hypothesis is that differences in semantic detail indicate that speakers of Dene and Totonac encode spatial topological relations at a higher, more detailed degree of specificity than Germanic and Romance languages. This is reflected in a larger inventory of morphosyntactic and semantic choices and spatial devices. Upper Necaxa Totonac encodes spatial relations through adpositions, body parts and posture verb constructions. Here the general focus is on the differing degrees of specificity speakers assign to different figure-ground asymmetries. The results of a visually based elicitation procedure point to differences in the encoding of spatial topological relations between speakers and between languages. This research echoes numerous studies on language variation in spatial semantics familiar from typological and cognitive semantic approaches (Bloom et al. 1996; Levinson 2003; Levinson and Wilkins 2006; Senft 1997). The differing degrees of specificity are the result of different practices chosen by speakers. The data supports the idea that linguistic meaning reflects degrees of specificity in social practices or language games.
The fifth chapter on “Language Loss in Spatial Semantics: Dene” returns to figure-ground asymmetries and degrees of specificity. Again, languages, or rather speakers, carve up the spatial domain depending on individual choice rather than purely objective coordinates. This chapter illustrates intralingual differences, making the point that spatial semantic encodings can differ significantly even within a homogeneous community of speakers . First and foremost, the data points to an ongoing process of language loss in the encoding of spatial relations and spatial cognition in Dene, the highly endangered Northern Athapaskan language covered in

Chapter 1: Setting the stage

55

earlier chapters. A comparison of older Dene speakers (age 65 to 85; data elicitation from 2002 until 2006 in Cold Lake Alberta) with younger speakers (age 45 to 55) shows significant effects of language loss in the latter, seen in the description of simple spatial situations and consequent loss in spatial mental models.
The findings from younger speakers show that they have a more restricted set of spatial morphemes than older speakers. One crucial difference is that older speakers do not generally use spatial morphemes, such as adpositions. Moreover, the process of language loss in spatial semantics is seen in the fact that younger speakers do not use full classificatory verb paradigms (with the relevant grammatical particles) and that their expressions are generally ungrammatical. On the other hand, older Dene speakers construe and categorize spatial relations by using fine-grained morphosyntactic and semantic encoding patterns, that is, the introduced degree of specificity. These morphosyntactic affordances, i.e., the correlation between the environment and the functional characteristics of objects and the human being, are on the verge of extinction since younger speakers are unable to incorporate these patterns in their descriptions of various spatial scenes. As I argue in this chapter, this limitation is due to ongoing language loss and the influence of English as the dominant means of communication.
The sixth chapter presents an overview of a case study entitled “Spatial Concepts in Non-Literate Societies: Language and Practice in Eipo and Dene Chipewyan”50 conducted in collaboration with Wulf Schiefenhövel which describes environmental landmarks and cognitive maps. This chapter concerns linguistic representation and actual practices based on environmental landmarks in two unrelated languages. The chapter concerns both Eipomek and Dene. The focus here is on the repercussions of environmental experience and spatial orientation on language and cognition. The point of departure is the anthropological linguistic approach which places language in its social and cultural context, and cultural practices. Spatial knowledge is not only encoded in mental concepts or categories, it is also embodied and embedded in the lived histories of human beings and their cultural and linguistic practices.
It is apparent that some aspects of spatial cognition are culturespecific, being shaped by culture-specific practices of spatial orientation,

while others seem to be universal cognitive patterns. As far as its representational function is concerned, language plays a dual role, throwing light on both the structures of cognition and on the constructive process of shaping spatial cognition. Chapters 3–5 present the micro-scale of immediate spatial orientation, while Chapter 6 concerns mediate large-scale spatial orientation. Finally, Chapter 7 offers an overall summary and outlook. It presents an initial glimpse of a theory of cognitive semiotics aligned with cognitive anthropological approaches to form a culturalcognitive view of spatial semantics.

Chapter 2: Cognitive representation of knowledge: spatial mental models51

2.1 Introduction
I would like to begin with some very general comments which refer back to the introduction. Traditionally, a thought is generally interpreted as something expressed in words, and so it is natural to assume that its underlying representation must be in a verbal form (Malt and Wolff 2010). But words and propositions are not the only kinds of things of which individuals are consciously aware when they are thinking. They also experience imagery, they “see” pictures in their mind’s eye with varying degrees of intensity. Are words (symbolic representation) and pictures (analogue representation) the sole candidates for thought and cognitive processes?
When addressing the abovementioned phenomenological and gestalt theory issues on visual perception, it should be apparent that the idea of a mental picture is highly idealized. Johnson-Laird and Wason state that Oatley, in his description of Micronesian voyaging, refers not only to embodied cognition theories, but also introduces distributed cognition processes (see also Hutchins 1996; Johnson-Laird and Wason 1977). This process records various means of spatial orientation and navigation between islands without instruments in cultures with non-written traditions. In these cultures, knowledge is transferred by oral and hands-on practices. Their seafarers can undertake voyages with a high degree of navigational accuracy through an elegant system of dead reckoning and more particularly the etak system. They conceive of the boat as stationary with islands moving past it, and the stars wheeling overhead. This spatial mental model plays a key role in spatial orientation in their navigational system. For my purposes, the most significant aspect of the system is that it is no mere visual image. It is a dynamic spatial mental model, that is, a representation of the world from which spatial inference or rather mental triangulation can be made (Johnson-Laird and Wason 1977: 523, passim 526–527).

2.1 Introduction

It is generally assumed that humans, if raised in the appropriate environment, can learn to speak any language and to think and operate effectively in the context of any culture. But what about different peoples’ traditional bodies of specialized lore? Are they organized in similar ways? Cognitive psychologists are interested in understanding how specialists mentally process and store their knowledge so that they can retrieve it as needed. I am interested in the linguistic, or rather semiotic, encoding processes in different languages which point to different encoding decisions based on culture-specific spatial mental models.
Traditional navigators of the central Caroline Islands provide a case in point. Carolinian navigation techniques include a sizable body of knowledge developed for ocean voyaging for distances of up to several hundred miles among the tiny islands and atolls of Micronesia. With no writing system, local navigators have had to commit to memory their knowledge of the stars, sailing directions, seamarks, and how to read the waves and clouds to determine currents and predict weather.
This chapter is concerned with implicit or tacit knowledge of spatial orientation. This survey in particular takes perception at face value, implementing spatial mental models as cognitive representations of implicit knowledge systems in orientation, specifically navigation on land and at sea.52 Johnson-Laird and Wason’s paraphrased description of navigation techniques and distributed cognition above provides a snapshot of the point of departure: it is held that internal representations of implicit knowledge structures are only partially represented in language. Spatial mental models are dynamic systems of representation. As such, I cover various systems of spatial orientation described in language and culture in different areas. Physical geographic parameters are also required for anchoring salient geographic concepts in landscape orientation (Duvall 2011: 121).
The point of departure is a desire to investigate more fully the subject of mental models, an essential prerequisite for understanding how paradigms of perception and representation have been predefined or pre-

52 Minsky uses the term frame-system theory. He proposes that “[w]hen one encounters a new situation […], one selects from memory a structure called a frame. This is a remembered framework to be adapted to fit reality by changing details as necessary. A frame is a data-structure for representing a stereotyped situation like being in a certain kind of living room or going to a child’s birthday party. Attached to each frame are several kinds of information. Some of this information is about how to use the frame. Some is about what one can expect to happen next. Some is about what to do if these expectations are not confirmed. We can think of a frame as a network of nodes and relations” (Minsky 1977: 355). Note that I use spatial mental models and frame-system theory interchangeably (see Knauff 2013 for a logical approach to spatial layout models).

formed by those we are studying. Whether we want to reconstruct their mental models or show how humans move in space, we must identify their a priori notions of space, and the implicit cognitive knowledge or assumed linguistic determinants, i.e., spatial mental models. These are all important features of mental models as cognitive computation mechanisms and processes in particular. The application of mental models needs to be modified since they are usually viewed synchronically53, whereas a more panchronic approach is called for here.
Orientation processes on land and at sea are based on fundamentals in mental triangulation and gestalt theory conceptions of spatial relations (figure-ground asymmetries). A major example seen in orientation on water is dead reckoning, or navigation without instruments (Hutchins 1996: 65–93; see also Hutchins 1983). More specifically, this method of navigation depends on determining one’s position at any given time based on the distance and direction travelled since leaving the last known location (Gladwin 1970: 144). With this method, the navigator monitors the motion of the boat to determine the displacement from a previous position (Hutchins 1996: 56). This mental computing or mental triangulation, i.e., the transformation and propagation of representational states, is arguably also used on land (Hutchins 1996: 49). Along with this method, then, I also investigate travellers’ reports, stories, symbols, icons, winds, roads and other kinds of representation to reconstruct spatial mental models of spatial orientation based on implicit knowledge systems.
As I have stated, the overall project assembles various toponyms, landmarks and reference points in various semiotic systems to elucidate ethnogeography. This works on the assumption that ethnogeography underlies cognitive information-processing systems of spatial orientation (Marr 1982). As this book argues, specific encoding patterns vary between orientation reference systems. Moreover, spatial reference frames are shown which construe a dense matrix or gestalt-like representation of knowledge systems. As such, the text also considers course-maintaining systems on land and at sea based on different sorts of semiotic systems.
The rationale is the belief that spatial mental models/cognitive maps, as gestalt-like representations of environmental cues, form dynamic mental models/cognitive maps. This means that different knowledge systems of an implicit (tacit knowledge) and explicit nature interact with each other

to enable a traveller to find his/her way at sea or through vast terrains.54 As such they are of particular interest when considering universals of spatial encoding patterns as opposed to those which are truly culture-specific or historical. Cultures differ in this respect. What may be common to all cultures, and thus universal, is the gestalt-like constructive process of spatial mental models (see below). These mental models function as implicit knowledge systems which enable humans to navigate in a specific environment at a given time and space.
Here the focus is more on the theory behind mental models which use toponyms of environmental landmarks and topographical reference frames. Mental models represent, among other things, spatial information at an abstract conceptual level of cognitive representation. They are cognitive layouts of the environment and human experience as represented in long-term memory (Wilson and Keil 1999: 25). Knowledge about both space and time must be integrated to enable human orientation in the environment. Humans are capable of forming sophisticated representations of spatial relations integrated as mental models. Some more central mental representations appear to be closely tied to perceptual systems (Ehrenfels 1890; Jastrow 1899; Müller-Lyer 1889; Pinna 2010; Rubin 1921; Thiering 2011; Wertheimer 1923).
Humans use various forms of imagery based on visual, auditory and other perceptual systems to perform internal mental processes such as mental rotation (Shepard and Metzler 1977). Tolman’s results imply that animals and humans go beyond the information given when they go directly to a goal after having learned an indirect path (Tolman 1948). That conclusion is most evident when the spatial cues marking the goal location are not visible from the starting position (Wilson and Keil 1999: 135). Diachronically, a comparison of different semiotic systems is particularly worthwhile, offering as it does insight into the external representation of spatial mental models. Such models may be compared to synchronic representations in terms of universals.
This chapter further presents fundamental theoretical implications of adapting spatial mental models to semiotic systems such as practices. It has been argued elsewhere that maps, people, buildings, objects, historic and fictive events are perceived at a given time and place. Consequently we can establish a link between these cues and cognitive association. The representation of such cues is modeled in cognitive psychology as sche-

mas, frames, scenarios, scripts, mental models, mental frames and cognitive maps. Mental models can include collections of toponyms, landmarks, frames of reference and other cues that help to mentally triangulate a reference system. Objects as reference cues are defined as follows:
Knowledge of an object embodies knowledge of the object’s spatial dimensions, that is, of the gradable characteristics of its typical, possible or actual, extension in space. Knowledge of space implies the availability of some system of axes which determine the designation of certain dimensions of, and distances between, objects in space. (Lang, Carstensen and Simmons 1991: 7)
I am interested in surveying such systems and their linguistic representation. One very specific spatial mental model of a combination of implicit and explicit knowledge is the above mentioned practice of navigation at sea seen in Micronesian cultures. These practices and cognitive processes are adopted to navigation or piloting techniques on land and at sea. Micronesian cultures are renowned for navigation of the open seas without instruments, but rather with mental gestalt-like constructions based, as I argue, on various implicit and explicit knowledge cues. These implicit cues are based on the construction of a so-called “star compass” and a sort of mental triangulation performed with this compass (Hutchins 1983, 1996). This mental triangulation is apparent in the use of a third, phantom or emergency island (Gladwin 1970; Oatley 1977; Sarfert 1911). This mental triangulation is an inference process. It is neatly summarized in the following description of the Micronesian navigator’s techniques, which claims that
[w]hen the navigator envisions in his mind’s eye that the reference island is passing under a particular star he notes that a certain number of segments [etak; M.T.] have been completed and a certain proportion of the voyage has therefore been accomplished. (Gladwin 1970: 184)
In addition, navigators need to know a number of islands (50 to 100 on average), reefs (as seamarks), water drifts, winds, wave colors and so on. Navigators are also explicitly trained by older navigators to empirically accommodate, assimilate and finally equilibrate knowledge systems using a bird’s-eye perspective (Piaget and Inhelder 1956). They learn a vast number of explicit information cues, as well as skills for mentally representing maps and different routes.
This chapter presents the theoretical framework for exploring the degree to which environmental experience and spatial orientation is reflected in texts, language and practices (as implicit knowledge systems such as spatial mental models). It is an ethnogeographic account of place names, distances between cities and other localities, and coastlines or other features. It is argued that non-linguistic information as cultural practice and

2.1 Introduction

implicit knowledge system has an impact on spatial language and categorization in orientation.
Furthermore, I believe that topographical spatial information in particular, but also scale, scope, distance, reference systems of the immediate environment are represented as spatial mental models of topographical coordinates and semiotic practices. The data illustrates the constructive process of environmental landmarks and cultural heritage such as practices, myths and ethnogrammars on the shaping of spatial categorization. Moreover, all manner of landmarks on land and at sea are used as proximate course-maintaining devices for orientation. These landmarks shape and determine a detailed topographical mental model of the environment as represented via language and various practices.
Reference frames are especially important when orienting oneself in different environments. The semiotic systems under review present interesting descriptions of environmental terrains and coordinates. Mental and perceptual course-maintaining in different cultures rely on mental models, that is, the orientation techniques are processes of inference within the structure of cognitive maps. As such, they are structures of spatial reasoning, which is an activity of unconscious inference (Helmholtz 1867). The aim is to employ mental models that draw a correspondence between “real world” cues, such as objects and places, and their symbolic equivalents in the models. As such the models are able to implement knowledge from earlier experiences. They are instruments of deduction processes in the context of given knowledge (Renn and Damerow 2007: 313). They are also context-specific and do not – in contrast with gestalt theory approaches – rely on universal mechanisms. They combine past and present experiences to form a cognitive network. This network also requires cultural, linguistic and historical knowledge. In the case of orientation, mental models are conceived as cognitive maps and these in turn provide mental clues about the traveller’s trajectory in his/her environment.
This project explores the degree to which environmental experience and spatial orientation is reflected in spoken and written language, itineraries, texts, maps and practices. This is in line with current anthropological linguistic approaches which place language and other knowledge systems in social and cultural context, and its cultural practices (Foley 1997; Mark et al. 2011). Spatial knowledge is not only encoded in mental concepts and categories, it is also embodied in the lived histories of human beings and their cultural and linguistic practices as encoded in texts or maps (Foley 1997: 177; Johnson 1987; Siegel and White quoted above).
The issue here is the relationship between non-linguistic information and spatial language, that is, environmental landmarks such as rivers,

Chapter 2: Cognitive representation of knowledge: spatial mental models

63

mountains, trees and winds, and the medium (time, distance, measurement data) between landmarks. The argument is that non-linguistic information has an impact on spatial language and categorization, that is, reference to space and its relation to semiotic systems. Data points illustrate the influence and constructive process of environmental landmarks and cultural heritage in shaping spatial categorization.
Burenhult and Levinson ask how landscape features appear as nameable objects and, in particular, whether there are universal categories (Burenhult and Levinson 2008: 136). Moreover, they argue that landmarks or rather environments are interesting features of categorization (see also Mark et al. 2011). That this is indeed the case will be shown in the analysis of the relevant semiotic systems.
One aim of this book is to present some of the most fundamental spatial notions based on environmental or regional landmarks as transmitted and represented in different empirical sources. This approach deviates from the descriptions of landscape features above in the sense that it adopts spatial mental models that are referred to in navigational orientation techniques. This kind of navigation on land and at sea relies heavily on mental models and mental triangulation in ensuring that the navigator has a spatial conception of his position at any given time. These techniques combine implicit and explicit knowledge systems based on geographical coordinates.

2.2 Theoretical basics
This section presents some theoretical fundamentals which are vital for understanding spatial mental models. The first subsection presents cognitive techniques for orientation and navigation, that is, landmarks, and mental models as cognitive maps. It is argued that for orientation, travellers rely on cognitive maps as a mental process of inference. This is followed by a description of ideas of space and degrees of specificity. The section ends with a look at the basics of figure-ground asymmetries and frames of reference. All of these theoretical issues are important when describing one’s orientation in an environment, whether one uses instruments or not. Other kinds of orientational devices are governed by implicit knowledge of course maintaining and explicit knowledge of place names, buildings, rivers, coasts lines, etc., serving as reference systems. In the course of my argumentation I present some fundamental spatial concepts and representations which are based on anthropomorphological spatial knowledge in different semiotic systems. This spatial knowledge is

developed by members of any culture on the basis of human phylogenetic adaptations throughout their ontogenesis.
Finally, it is important to stress once more that spatial cognition is externally represented in spoken language, texts, and maps as well as in culture-specific practices (Foley 1997: 169–178). Hence, language and practice are understood as external representations of mental concepts or, as Boas put it about hundred years ago, human language is one of the most important manifestations of mental life (Boas 1997 [1911]: 68).
I begin with the general notion of mental models, followed by general comments on visual perception and cognition.

2.3 Cognitive representation of knowledge: spatial mental models
This paragraph introduces a brief summary on mental models (JohnsonLaird 1983; van der Zee and Nikanne 2000). In general terms, mental models are cognitive ways of representing knowledge.
“Mental models represent entities and persons, events and processes, and the operations of complex systems” (Johnson-Laird 2005: 187). Nöth presents a very clear definition of mental models as seen in the introduction:
Unter einem (mentalen) Bild versteht auch die kognitive Psychologie die mentale Reproduktion oder Repräsentation einer nicht gegenwärtigen perzeptuellen Erfahrung. (Nöth 2000: 232)
Nöth is essentially summarizing cognitive psychological theories of mental models or mental pictures (mentales Bild) as mental reproductions and representations of non-present visual experiences. Moser:
[…] eine zentrale Eigenschaft mentaler Modelle: Die mentalen Modelle ermöglichen nicht nur das Finden von geeigneten Heuristiken zur Problemlösung, sondern sie gewichten auch die verschiedenen Aspekte desselben Sachverhalts je nach gewähltem mentalem Modell unterschiedlich. Dadurch wird die Aufmerksamkeit auf ganz bestimmte Problemlösungen gelenkt, während andere aus dem Blickfeld geraten. (Moser 2003: 188)
Finally, Knauff introduces an adaptation of Johnson-Lairds mental model theory, stating
[h]owever, my main motivation here is to develop an alternative account that says that the human reasoned construct and inspect qualitative, non-metrical integrated spatial representations, rather than visual images. In the space to reason theory [Knauff’s proposed theory; M.T.], I call such integrated spatial representations spatial layout models. This is a good place to clarify the difference between

Chapter 2: Cognitive representation of knowledge: spatial mental models

65

mental models in Johnson-Laird’s sense and spatial layout models in my sense. On the one hand, spatial layout models are mental models, since they are also integrated representations. […] On the other hand, I partly concur with the many cognitive psychologists who criticize the fact that the exact contrast between models and images has changed over time and still remains unclear. (Knauff 2013: 33–34; emphasis original)
The quotation below summarizes the idea of mental models as implicit processes of deduction. Here the example is based on Aristotelian dynamics.
Das Beispiel dieser aristotelischen Dynamik zeigt, wie ein mentales Modell durch den Wechsel vom Medium des intuitiven Denkens zur schriftlich fixierten Sprache zum Ausgangspunkt und zur Grundfrage einer naturphilosophischen Theorie werden kann. Die aristotelische Dynamik expliziert in der Form von allgemeinen Aussagen die Struktur von intuitiven Schlussfolgerungen [...]. Das Beispiel macht darüber hinaus deutlich, dass die sprachliche Explikation intuitiver Schlussfolgerungen, indem sie Bedeutungsspielräume einengt, eine Transformation des solchen Schlussfolgerungen impliziten Wissens bewirken kann. (Renn and Damerow 2007: 317)
Renn and Damerow argue that the mental model of Aristotelian dynamics, specifically the motion-implies-force model, is based on an explication of intuitive thinking of ancient philosophers. This model is not based on perception and phenomenology of the Welt-an-sich (the world as it is), but on a mental construct, i.e., a mental model. The transmission from intuitive thinking to written language and theory shows that a mental model can be the basis for a theory. We see the change from implicit (procedural) to explicit (declarative) knowledge structures. More specifically, and more importantly, verbal manifestation of intuitive deduction profiles a transformation of deduction of implicit knowledge structures.
Moreover, mental models consist of elements and the relations between them (spatial, temporal, causal, force dynamics etc.; see specifically Mulder 2007 and Talmy 2000: 409–470 on force dynamics). Elements are prototypically objects in the world (Bryant et al. 2000: 118). Various qualitative properties can be ascribed to these objects. They enable deductive reasoning on the basis of a priori knowledge. The data sources analyzed throughout this project regard any kind of written source as a form of externalized mental representation. There are also clues which fill in the gaps of memory and knowledge. As such they are not universal but context-specific, depending on a culture, its history and the speaker.

2.4 A simple cognitive network

2.4 A simple cognitive network

The Test-Operate-Test-Exit (TOTE) unit is presented as an example of cognitive representation procedures. This unit is a cognitive procedure for calibrating between as-is states and target states in long-term memory. These units enable mental models to adapt to new forms of knowledge. Hence, they act as TOTE procedures in a logarithmic feedback process. This means that an incoming perceptual input In assimilates and accommodates the given mental model Rn, that is, the cognitive knowledge representation (= R) system, to eventually equilibrate the input and output systems (as-is vs. target state). This input-output mechanism is not a linear calibration, but a trial-and-error procedure through feedback processes. In simple terms: new, externally triggered information (= assimilation) meets old information or representation (= accommodation) and requires adjustment (= equilibration). Past experience is here connected and combined with present experience as outlined in semantic network theories (Jackendoff 1983: 122–127; Johnson-Laird 1983: 211–242). This new experience is embedded in a cognitive network. The following function illustrates a simple network as a rule system:
[placex] ! [place place-function ([thingy])]
This rule system applies for the following propositions:
The mouse ran from under table. = [path from ([place under ([thing table])])]. The mouse ran into the room. = [path to ([place in ([thing room])])].
The figure (‘the mouse’), the path (‘into’) and the location and ground (‘table/room’) are conceptual entities. The proposition involves the verb phrase X ‘ran into/ran from under’ Y encoding the trajectory (‘into’ = source(starting point)/goal(endpoint)) of the figure. The transitive motion event ‘ran’ also encodes the starting point from a source and highlights the goal of the movement ‘into’. In English, these entities are linguistically encoded as prepositions, verbs of motion and other participants.
In analyzing different languages with non-written traditions, the goal is to come up with a number of general rule systems which can be implemented in semantic or propositional networks. Semantic networks are representation systems of knowledge in memory. As such they are semantic relationships of conceptual or cognitive entries. Entities of abstract or concrete objects are represented as units in semantic networks (Strube, Becker, Freksa, Hahn, Opwis, and Palm 1996: 422–423). Connections between units represent relations between entities. In English, for exam-

Chapter 2: Cognitive representation of knowledge: spatial mental models

67

ple, it can be argued that path is encoded via ‘to’, ‘from’, ‘towards’, ‘away from’, or via a thingy or placey (Jackendoff 1983: 166). Hence, the task is to identify various cognitive parameters such as figure, ground, scope, scale, perspective and reference frames to describe spatial mental and cultural models in different conceptions of space.
These networks enable us to deduce, from incomplete knowledge, a coherent gestalt similar to cognitive contours55. Moreover, mental models bridge different levels of knowledge representing the same object or event in different knowledge structures.
Again, mental models are specific forms of knowledge representation. The quotations below neatly summarize three different approaches to defining such models. The first two quotes concern the synchronic cognitive knowledge system while the third quotation, from Renn and Damerow, focuses on the historic or diachronic value of mental models.
Mentale Modelle bezeichnen eine bestimmte Form der Repräsentation von Wissen [...]. Das Konzept des mentalen Models sieht vor, daß Menschen strukturelle und dynamische Aspekte komplexer Problembereiche des Alltags (z.B. technische Geräte, logische Schlußfolgerungen) dadurch repräsentieren, daß sie interne Modelle aufbauen, welche die jeweiligen Sachverhalte (Funktionieren einer Kaffeemaschine, Textverstehen bei Gebrauchsanweisungen, räumliche Inferenzen) anschaulich machen und mental zu simulieren erlauben. (Strube, Becker, Freksa, Hahn, Opwis and Palm 1996: 406)
Die einzigen Wege zwischen der Welt und dem Gehirn sind Nervenstränge wie jene, die von Augen, Ohren und der Haut her kommen. Auf welche Weise gelingt es den Signalen, die durch diese Nerven gehen, uns das Gefühl zu vermitteln, uns »in« der Welt außerhalb zu befinden? Die Antwort lautet, daß dieses Gefühl eine komplexe Illusion darstellt. Wir haben nie tatsächlich direkten Kontakt zu der Welt außerhalb. Statt dessen arbeiten wir mit Modellen der Welt, die wir in unseren Gehirnen fertigen. (Minsky 1994: 110; emphasis added)

55 “Some notions commonly cited as image schemas fall instead in my third class, conceptual archetypes. These are experientially grounded concepts so frequent and fundamental in our everyday life that the label archetype does not seem inappropriate. Here are some examples: a physical object, an object in a location, an object moving through space, the human body, the human face, a whole and its parts, a physical container and its contents, seeing something, holding something, handing something to someone, exerting force to effect a desired change, a face-to-face social encounter. These notions are fairly schematic, but considerably less so than the configurational concepts. Some are incorporated as components of others. While they can be quite complex and hard to describe explicitly (try explaining what a physical object is!), they are basic in the sense that they are readily apprehended as coherent conceptual gestalts [emphasis M.T.] at an early developmental stage” (Langacker 2008: 33–34).

2.4 A simple cognitive network

fahrungen einbetten. Sie ermöglichen so Schlüsse aus unvollständigen Informationen. (Renn and Damerow 2007: 313)
According to Strube et al. (first quotation) mental models are specific forms of knowledge representation. Mental models are problem-solving procedures built on internal models of experiences in daily routine. In other words, in mental models “human beings construct mental models of the world, and [...] they do so by employing tacit mental processes” (Johnson-Laird 1983: X)56.
The second quotation by Minsky argues much more epistemologically in stating that the only connection between the world and the brain is the nervous system, including the eyes, ears, and the skin. Minsky argues that the idea of direct contact with the world is an illusion. Human beings, like other animals, are never in direct contact with the world. Instead humans cognitively construe models of the world; cognition is the filter between the world and the human being, in other words, autopoietic systems are in effect (Schmidt 1994, 1996, 1998; Varela, Thomson and Rosch 1991).
In a broader and more diachronic sense, the last quotation states that mental models combine past and present experiences, embedding information to form cognitive networks of memory representation. Note that this is not a new idea since Fauconnier defined his mental spaces as “structured, incrementable sets with elements (a, b, c, …) and relations holding between them (R1ab, R2a, R3cbf, …), such that new elements can be added to them and new relations established between their elements” (Fauconnier 1994: 16). He highlights the idea of matching new and old information in a similar way to Renn and Damerow. Fauconnier is very specific in his modeling of mental spaces and their relations to linguistic cues. He states that
linguistic expressions will typically establish new spaces, elements within them, and relations holding between the elements. I shall call space-builders expressions that may establish a new space or refer back to one already introduced in the discourse. (Fauconnier 1994: 17)
Common to all these approaches is a cognitive level of mental representation. In line with Nunberg (above), Fauconnier argues that human beings establish links or connections “between objects of a different nature for psychological, cultural, or locally pragmatic reasons and that the links thus established allow reference to one object in terms of another appropriately linked to it” (Fauconnier 1994: 3). The basic argument here is the Identifica-

56 Johnson-Laird goes on to state that “the concept is that of recursive mental processes that enable human beings to understand discourse, to form mental models of the real and the imaginary and to reason by manipulating such models” (Johnson-Laird 1983: XI; emphasis original). The key issues is tacit, or as I refer to it, implicit knowledge.

tion Principle. This principle holds that two objects, a and b, are linked by a pragmatic function F (b = F (a)), a description of a, da, may be used to identify its counterpart b. The example Fauconnier uses is a function linking authors with the books containing their work: a = Plato, b = F1(a) = “books by Plato”. The Identification Principle allows us to deduce from “Plato is on the top shelf” that “the books by Plato are on the top shelf”. The first proposition encodes a description or name of a person, da (= Plato) that identifies an object b, i.e., the collection of books (on the book shelf) (Fauconnier 1994: 4). In a similar situation, this principle also profiles a trigger that identifies the target or source domain. It is not Plato who is on the book shelf, but his work. The decision to profile his work depends on the context. It would be rather strange if Plato were sitting on a bookshelf, but this would at least have been a possible world.
As far as implicit knowledge structures are concerned, mental space builders or connectors – the deduction from one piece of information, cue a to another one b – help model the various data cues and reference points as outlined in various texts and oral descriptions by different authors. These connectors are used to model semantic networks which are interrelated knowledge systems of implicit (procedural) and explicit (declarative) processes. This is even more interesting since Fauconnier argues that geographic spaces, for instance, are linguistic spaces (Fauconnier 1994: 30). This represents a direct link between physical or imagined spaces and their linguistic and cognitive counterparts modeled as semantic networks.
How can this interaction between perception and cognition be conceived? The following outline presents a first glimpse of the intricate procedures involved.

2.5 Cognition, perception, and language
In the field of cognitive linguistics, it is widely agreed that languages reflect conceptual structure and that variation across languages encodes different conceptual systems (Evans and Green 2007; Jackendoff 1983; Langacker 1987; Levinson 2003; Levinson and Wilkins 2006; Talmy 2000; Thiering 2009b). About three decades ago, the cognitive linguist (or cognitive generativist, personal communication) Ray Jackendoff queried the nature of meaning (and I would add spatial memory) in human language, “such that we can talk about what we perceive” and “what does the grammatical structure of natural language reveal about the nature of perception and cognition?” (Jackendoff 1983: 3). He further claims, as I do,

70

2.5 Cognition, perception, and language

that to study language is to study cognition. His focus, though, was on the grammatical structure of natural language. In the ensuing three decades, cognitive linguistics has produced many insights into the intricacies of language and cognition from different interdisciplinary perspectives (Evans and Green 2007; Geeraerts and Cuyckens 2007; Langacker 2000, 2008; Levinson 2003; Levinson and Wilkins 2006). As has been outlined above, one common denominator is that language gives insights into the mental world of a speaker and a speaker’s community. This is especially true when combing psychological theories on cognition with semantic models, or semantic networks (Johnson-Laird 1983: 211).
Moreover, cognitive linguistics asks, among other questions, whether language actually has a constructive or determining influence on cognition, and what role visual perception has in this process (Marr 1982: 31–38, and Marr’s Chapter 2 on Vision; see also Thiering 2011). Talmy and others refer in particular to the gestalt theory framework of figure-ground asymmetries (Langacker 1987, 1991, 2000, 2008; Talmy 1978, 1983, 2000). Figure-ground asymmetries are essential in constructing spatial and geometrical relationships (Ehrenfels 1890; Koffka 1930; Pinna 2011; Rubin 1921; Thiering 2011; Wertheimer 1923, 1925).
In visual perception, we choose a reference object to which to relate a canonically smaller object in a given spatial scene (see below). This process is not only constitutive for cognitive representations of objects, events and so on, but also for linguistic constructions, at least from a cognitive linguistic perspective. These constructions are processes embedded in mental models which involve engrams. These engrams, or memory chunks, are cognitive meaning components, meaning that the knowledge of the experienced world is represented in such mental models. These models are named “gestalts” in reference to the constructive process of the speaker in his/her interaction with the perceptual world – linguistically, phenomenologically and cognitively. This gives rise to the idea of a gestalt as a as a mental model or cognitive map in reference to the phenomenologist approach posited by Merleau-Ponty and the later Wittgenstein (Merleau-Ponty 1974, 1976; Wittgenstein 2006).
A mental model is not a static cognitive representation, but rather a dynamic cognitive model. Changing aspects of the figure or the ground also imply changes of meaning ascription (Thiering 2011; see also the chapter on figure-ground reversals below). As such the gestalt model adapts to changes in perception and various information cues that are non-linguistic and linguistic. Changes in figure-ground asymmetries support the idea that they are only partially universal across cultures, changing in response to culture-specific and individual choices. These changes are

online processes adapting to input cues, meaning that mental models are dynamic representation systems. The example of navigation on open seas without instruments supports such gestalt-like mental models. Information cues include the abovementioned aspects such as wind directions, reefs, birds, and the so-called third, phantom or emergency island (Gladwin 1970; Hutchins 1983, 1996; Sarfert 1911). Also reviewed are landmarks, such as rivers and direction of flow, mountains, as well as star constellations which determine direction and thus form frames of reference for orientation. It is assumed that input cues forming a gestalt as a cognitive mental model are multimodal, that is, different information channels influence the cognitive apparatus. These resulting mental models, or abstract mental representations, are conceived as gestalts (Oatley 1977). They combine various implicit and explicit information cues that of which the speaker-hearer is not necessarily conscious.
In terms of cognitive economy, gestalts have the advantage that they gain information in a holographic manner. This sounds more far-fetched than it really is. A holographic visual representation needs only a small number of information cues to construe an image, usually a 3D image (Marr 1982)57. This image is based on the speaker-hearer’s physiological apparatus and his/her cognitive structures. To form a gestalt, for example to orient oneself in a known or unknown environment, a small number of cues are sufficient for construing a gestalt-like representation. This gestalt is much more than a simple figure-ground asymmetry since it also depends on online computing. It also adds various other imaging parameters that set the stage for a speaker-hearer (see below for some additional imaging parameters). Note that Hutchins explicitly argues in favor of this idea, saying of Micronesian navigation that “a practiced navigator can construct the whole compass mentally from a glimpse of only one or two stars near the horizon” (Hutchins 1996: 70). He goes on to say that this ability is indispensable in construing a mental model for his orientation since the star bearings he needs to triangulate may not be visible at the time of the voyage. Hence, “the star compass is an abstraction which can be oriented as a whole by determining the orientation of any part” (Hutchins 1996: 70).
Johnson further argues that these “are gestalt structures, consisting of parts standing in relations and organized into unified wholes” (Johnson

our experience is embodied, that is, structured by the nature of the bodies we have and by our neurological organization […] the concepts we have access to and the nature of the ‘reality’ we think and talk about are a function of our embodiment: we can only talk about what we can perceive and conceive, and the things we can perceive and conceive derive from embodied experience. (Evans and Green 2007: 46)
The empirical support comes from different sources such as elicitation tools, corpora, ethnolinguistic texts and different practices. Practices are simply actions of handcraft or construction sites. In the empirical sources under review, these practices encode knowledge systems transferred from one generation to the next via actual hands-on practices.
Ever since gestalt psychologists developed theories of perceptual constraints on visual perception, the extent to which language and hence symbolic function influence the construal of a visual scene has also been questioned (Ehrenfels 1890; Jastrow 1899; Koffka 1935; Köhler 1929; Metzler 1953; Müller-Lyer 1889; Rubin 1921; Wertheimer 1923, 1925; see Merleau-Ponty 1974, 1976 on a phenomenological approach based on gestalt theory approaches). Minsky points out that we humans always construe mental models of the world based on the structure of our brains (as well as the body; Minsky 1977; but see Gallagher 2005 on the body and mind interaction and Hutchins 1996 on distributed cognition). This means that perception is a mediator or a process between cognition and the external world. Specifically, mental models are the actual construing devices or rather abstract mental representations of “the real world” (Johnson-Laird 1983; Krumnack et al. 2011; Minsky 1994).
The cognitive-semantic approach in accordance with Langacker (1987) and Talmy (1978, 1983, 2000) adopts the figure-ground asymmetry (or Langacker’s technical term trajector-landmark) and uses it for cognitive linguistic and cognitive anthropologist analysis. Broadly speaking, the distinction generally (but not always) follows the syntactic division of a sentence into subject and object (Langacker 1987: 231; Thiering 2011). Below I will describe this asymmetry in more detail.
Along with these mental models, this project presents various ideas of space, or Raumbilder, as introduced above (Malotki 1979). Such ideas of

58 It should be noted that Johnson explicitly attacks objectivist theories of meaning, claiming, for example, that “meaning is an abstract relation between symbolic representations (either words or mental representations) and objective (i.e., mind-independent) reality. These symbols get their meaning solely by virtue of their capacity to correspond to things, properties, and relations existing objectively in the world” (Johnson 1987: xxii).

space, i.e., the speaker’s basic delimination of his/her world of experience, are important in any language and culture. These ideas of space include the deictic parsing of space into ‘here’, ‘there’ and ‘over there’, or simply ‘celestial space’ as opposed to the ‘earth’ as encoded via ‘above’ and ‘down’. Ideas of space are also seen in the projectives ‘left’ and ‘right’, ‘in front of’ and ‘behind’, ‘up’ and ‘down’, ‘near’ and ‘far away’, ‘inside’ and ‘outside’, ‘in’ and ‘on’, the cardinal directions ‘north’, ‘south’, ‘east’, and ‘west’, ‘back’ and ‘forward’, manmade places such as ‘houses’ and ‘geographic places’ or ‘surfaces’ (Malotki 1979: 294–297).59 These are certainly based on cognitive frames of reference, that is, cognitive descriptions of spatial arrays as reference systems serving as a shared spatial anchor (Haun et al. 2011).
The following section presents the idea of frames of reference as coordinate systems for orientation.

2.6 Frames of reference
Frames of reference are crucial in the linguistic encoding of spatial orientation and spatial cognition in particular (Eilan, McCarthy and Brewer 1993; Levinson 1996: 126; but for a critical discussion see Dokic and Pacherie 2006). The actual use of the concept refers back to gestalt theories of perception, which state that an organization of units serves to identify a coordinate system with certain properties of objects resulting in a gestalt. Thus, human beings instantiate relations between objects relying on various frames of reference which, as the name implies, serve as reference points.
According to Malotki (1979), the term “linguistic coordinate” means the division of a spatial configuration into a speaker, a hearer, and a third part (a person or a thing the speaker-hearer refers to; see Bühler 1999[1934]; Ogden and Richards 1923). Hence, a linguistic coordinate system is not just a geographical or mathematical abstract concept, but also a means of spatial configuration in linguistic encoding. The encoding

59 Note that in contrast to Hopi (the language in which Malotki specialises), some languages do not have real terms for cardinal directions. Yet it is believed that expressions such as ‘downstream’ and ‘upstream’ have a similar semantic function. So we can say that selected languages also evoke a three-way system of deictic reference. This three-way separation is similar to the German hier ‘here’, da ‘there’ and dort ‘over there’, which differentiate between proximal and distal distances taking the speaker as the anchor of his/her perspective (note the lack of a medial marker as we have seen for Hopi above).

2.6 Frames of reference

of spatial relations depends on certain spatial (and temporal) parameters that set the linguistic coordinate reference system for the speaker-hearer.
A reference point anchors a specific orientation between objects and the viewer (Carlson 1999, 2000, 2003; Carlson, Logan 2001; CarlsonRadvansky and Irwin 1993; Carlson-Radvansky, Carlson-Radvansky 1996; Levinson 2003). These construals are encoded in different languages in different ways, and thus differently grammaticalized or lexicalized, i.e., different grammatical or morphosyntactic components encode the various reference points (see Verhagen 2007 on construals and perspective). In considering frames of reference, Dokic and Pacherie argue that “perception may be perspective-free, in the sense that it need not involve any frames of reference” (Dokic and Pacherie 2006: 259). I shall determine whether this is also true of the languages and cultures reviewed here.
The meanings of verbal expressions are based on conceptualizations of figure-ground asymmetries (Thiering 2011; see below). In addition, all facets of our general knowledge of a conceived entity contribute to the meaning of an expression which designates this entity, and so we see again that any rigid distinction between semantics and pragmatics is superfluous (Nunberg 1978; Sweetser 1990). The encoding of spatial relations depends on certain spatial (and temporal) parameters that set the linguistic coordinate reference system for the speaker/hearer. In general, spatial marking is based on one of three different reference frames. These are assigned to the objects profiled in the situation (Carlson-Radvansky 1993; Carlson 1999, 2000, 2003; Carlson and Gordon 2001; Coventry and Garrod 2004; Levinson 2003).
The three frames of reference are (a) a viewer/ego-centered or relative frame, as in the English example “he’s to the left of the house” (assuming that from the perspective of the viewer, a person is situated to the left side of the house), (b) an object-centered or intrinsic frame, as in “he’s in front of the house” (assuming that the front is where the main door is located; the object has an inherent front and back side), and (c) an environmentcentered or absolute frame, as in “he’s north of the house/city”.
In (a), the viewpoint depends on the location of the perceiver’s vantage point and his/her relation to the figure and ground. The intrinsic frame in (b) is an object-centered reference system determined by culturespecific inherent features of the object. Finally, the absolute frame (c) is a fixed direction provided by, for example, a cardinal direction (for an extensive overview, see Levinson 2003; Levinson and Wilkins 2006).
This study will primarily focus on the semantic features of location, direction, path and manner of the figure and ground. It is argued that these ascriptions are determined by cultural, environmental and language-

specific affordances (Whorf 1956; Wygotski 1964; Watzlawick 1981; Hunt and Agnoli 1991; Lucy 1992a, 1992b). These in turn depend on speakerimposed figure-ground asymmetries which are attributed to the respective objects (Talmy 1978, 1983, 2000).
So far we have seen that spatial marking is based on the instantiation of one of three different reference frames. These are assigned to the objects profiled in the situation (Carlson 1999, 2000, 2003; Carlson and Logan 2001; Carlson-Radvansky and Irwin 1993; Coventry and Garrod 2004; Levinson 2003, but see Jackendoff 1996, who introduces eight different and more specific frames of reference). Dokic and Pacherie point out that the use of frames of reference “involves different cognitive abilities” (Dokic and Pacherie 2006: 264). The distinctions between these frames of reference are not absolute or clear-cut, rather they are highly idealized classifications which can intersect with each other. Nevertheless, frames of reference do have an advantage in that they can spell out the specific semantic functions and imaging parameters of language and the construer in particular to highlight the often highly subjectivized construction mechanisms.
Grabowski proposes the following situation: a person drives a car, with a passenger, along a road and sees another car at a certain distance, parking in the direction of traffic (in this example the car is a yellow “Beetle”) (Grabowski 1999: 14–15). The passenger asks whether she (the driver) could park “in front of” the Beetle (the German example is: “Halte doch bitte vor dem gelben Käfer an!”). Now, where is “in front of the Beetle”? Grabowski claims that we usually use ‘in front of’, and ‘behind’ as follows: If we move towards and pass by an object, then the place which appears first is called “in front of X (any object)”. The object itself (the yellow Beetle) would appear first and then the location behind the object. Hence, ‘in front of’ means that it is located between the object (the Beetle) and our perspective. ‘Behind the object’ is the location which is beyond the actual object (away from it). But cars have their own front-end and thus an intrinsic orientation. “In front of the Beetle” could therefore also mean the location of the car’s front which is actually ‘behind’ the Beetle from the driver’s perspective. We see that the choice of reference has to be specified to maintain location. Two frames of reference interfere: the intrinsic and the relative. Frames of reference are linguistically based on semantic structures. These are predications characterized relative to cognitive domains such as time, space and color. Any cognitive structure can function as a domain for a predication (Langacker 1987: 56). Moreover, meaning is conceived as

cognitive processing60. Expressions used to describe an ostensibly objective situation may differ in meaning, depending on how the situation is construed. This is seen in figure-ground reversals (Thiering 2011). An expression imposes a particular image on its domain. Imagery is used as a technical term for the cognitive capacity to construe a cognitive domain in alternate ways.
The following examples in (4) give an idea of this variation in different languages (1a–g elicited by the author).61

60 Langacker argues more specifically that verbs are symbolic processes, i.e., “a verb is a symbolic expression whose semantic pole designates a process” (1997: 244; highlight original). Different states are profiled in such a process consisting of a figure (trajector) and a ground (landmark) in a spatial domain. The key processes are summary and sequential scanning as contrasting modes of cognitive processing. The former is an additive process, a set of events contributing to a single configuration (coexistent and simultaneously available) whereas the latter involves the transformation of one configuration or blending into another (Langacker 1987: 145; see also Fauconnier 1994 on conceptual blending).

The results in (at least 4a–c, and possibly also 4d) indicate the speaker’s use of a particular kind of contextualized, intrinsic frame of reference (Levinson 2003; Levinson and Wilkins 2006). It does not encode an ‘in front of’ (nádaghe in Dene) relation of the primary to the secondary object. This is different to English, Norwegian, German, and Dutch (4e–g, 1,j) which use a relative frame of reference (the human body or viewer’s location being the anchor for orientation). Dene speakers encode a rather figure-dependent construal in which the entrance of the church is profiled as the intrinsic focal point in the encoding of the relation of the figure to the ground.
An intrinsic frame of reference expresses the figure’s orientation more specifically. Such expressions are generally called non-biased geometry, as opposed to biased geometry (Talmy 1983: 240). In expressions based on biased geometry, a relative frame of reference is instantiated that depends on the speaker’s perspective of the scene. In other words, the speaker profiles the figure as being in a frontal axis to the ground, depending on the speaker’s perspective and scope. This scope is important in Langacker’s stage model introduced above (Langacker 1987). It implies that the scope of the figure to be localized depends on various qualities of the ground. Langacker argues that speakers set a stage in which various imaging parameters are at work, e.g., figure, ground, scale, scope and distance. This stage enables the speaker to set a coordinate system which helps to construe different asymmetries.
I argue that the different frames conceptually construe different gestalts based on language-dependent features. An interesting example considering variation of frames is the navigational system of some Microne-

Chapter 2: Cognitive representation of knowledge: spatial mental models

79

sian seafarers. They use cognitive maps based on gestalt principles (Gladwin 1970; Hutchins 1983; Oatley 1977; Sarfert 1911). Micronesian navigation techniques combine different frames of reference to construe a cognitive map for orientation. As is argued, this cognitive map is a schematization as a gestalt. This gestalt serves as a coordinate system for the seafarer. With no nautical instruments, the seafarer construes a cognitive map for travel between islands from just a few anchor or reference points. Beside practical knowledge, they use orally transmitted knowledge of the various characteristics of the sea, such as riffs, currents, winds, and between 50 to 100 islands which all determine the journey. We can only understand these techniques if we assume cognitive maps to be mental models based on gestalt principles. This means that just one information input is required for construing a complete gestalt, again based on the process of cognitive contours.

2.7 Figure-ground constructions
As outlined above, this survey addresses the question of spatial mental models, specifically the role of meaning in the form of mental models in spatial semantics and its various figure-ground alignments. Consequently the focus is on participants that are construed as foregrounded (being canonically the figure or trajector) or backgrounded (the expected ground or landmark) and reversed patterns. This widely-known aspect of gestalt psychology is not limited to visual processes, but also applies to linguistic and verbal encoding patterns (Langacker 1987; Talmy 1978, 1983, 2000; Thiering 2011).
In considering the figure-ground asymmetry, the cognitive semanticist Talmy adopts a somewhat simplified gestalt psychology dichotomy. I concur with Talmy’s definition, arguing that certain cognitive categories play an important role in attributing the primary and secondary objects of a scene or stage (Talmy 1983: 230). These functions are encoded by the figure and ground of a scene – the variable element or positive space versus the reference element or negative space (Hofstadter 1980; Talmy 1978: 627; 1983: 232; 2000). The former is the smaller, moveable object whereas the latter is usually the larger, permanently located object (see Talmy’s 20 parameters for the domain of spatial configurations of figure-ground asymmetries; Talmy 1983: 277–78).
Three basic factors determine the contrast between figure and ground: the size, movement, and position of the figure in relation to the ground in the shared knowledge of the discourse participants. Talmy states that ad-

80

2.7 Figure-ground constructions

positional phrases profile relationships such as the location of the figure in relation to the ground, the time of the unfolding event, the manner in which the event unfolds, and the transition, motion and path of the figure (Talmy 2000).
Talmy adopts and simplifies the gestalt theorists’ figure-ground asymmetry, stating that a physical object is located or moves with respect to another object which serves as a reference point (Talmy 1978: 627). This asymmetry is embedded in schematization. Schematization is the process whereby specific aspects of a reference point of a scene are profiled to represent the whole gestalt (Talmy 2000; Sinha and Kuteva 1995). Talmy defines the basic asymmetry in a schematization process as follows:
The Figure object is a moving or conceptually movable point whose paths or site is conceived as a variable [...]. The Ground object is a reference-point, having a stationary setting within a reference-frame, with respect to which the figure’s path or site receives characterization. (Talmy 1978: 627, 2000: 315)
In a similar vein, the cognitive grammarian Ron Langacker defines this asymmetry as “a trajector as the figure in a relational profile; other salient entities are identified as landmarks” (Langacker 1987: 231). He further argues that
[…] relational predications display an inherent asymmetry in the presentation of their participants. This asymmetry is not reducible to semantic roles, i.e. the nature of participant involvement in the profiled relationship. [...] it is observable even for predications that designate symmetrical relationships: X equals Y is not precisely equivalent semantically to Y equals X, nor is X resembles Y equivalent to Y resembles X. [...] In the expression X equals Y [...], X is referred to as a trajector, and Y as a landmark. This terminology reflects the intuitive judgment that Y provides a reference point with respect to which X is evaluated or situated [...]. (Langacker 1987: 231)
This semantic distinction between the two conceptual categories reflects the fundamental notion of figure and ground in gestalt psychology (Ehrenfels 1890; Jastrow 1899; Köhler 1920, 1929; Koffka 1935: 177–210; Müller-Lyer 1889; Rubin 1921; Wertheimer 1923, 1925). It should be noted though that the gestalt psychologist’s definition is much more complex and broader than the notions adopted in cognitive semantics. This is why I introduced various imaging parameters above (Table 2). Nevertheless the basic idea of a reference object and an object that needs an anchor in a phenomenology of perception is somewhat similar.
Conceptually, the cognitive semantic notion is very specific in the distribution of meaning components in a sentence. Talmy shows that ostensibly similar sentences such as (a) “The bike is near the house” and (b) “The house is near the bike” are not the same semantically. They present two different (inverse) forms of a symmetric relation (Talmy 2000: 314).

Chapter 2: Cognitive representation of knowledge: spatial mental models

81

In (a) the house is the reference object, and in (b) it is the bike, which seems unlikely in actuality. Depending on the real world situation, a speaker might refer to the bike as the reference object for various reasons.
Zlatev presents a similar example in support of construed situations. In the expressions (a) “‘The tree is by the car” and (b) “The car is by the tree”, different situations are encoded. These differences indicate different worlds of human experience, that is, a non-objectivist approach is favored (Zlatev 2003: 332; see also Zlatev 2007). The semantic function chosen by the speaker does not correspond to the world of part-whole partitioning, but rather language-specific information. This might be due to pragmatics or culture-specific decisions or biases. This example already reveals that language, or rather writers/speakers, choose to reverse ostensibly natural figure-ground asymmetries. The empirical evidence presented here also supports this observation. In the list of characteristics above, Talmy presents various characteristics of the figure-ground asymmetry (Table 1) specifying the relationship, such as the figure being of greater concern or relevance (more salient) where the ground is of lesser concern or relevance (more backgrounded) (Talmy 2000: 316). This semantic distribution is different from the gestalt notion which is more perceptual, based on geometric coordinates (Lewin 1936: 87–92, 118–154).
Some of the these notions and technical terms are used to analyze cultural assumptions, traditional habits and behaviors, patterns and aims of action, and elementary measurement procedures in spaces. Indeed I claim that the application of cognitive psychological and cognitive semantic models onto different semiotic systems enhances the implicit presupposition of knowledge of spatial mental models. Moreover, the cognitive semantic approach outlined here is important in analyzing the selected data sources.
Cognitive and linguistic structures are intertwined in the construction of a cognitive world in the form of mental models. Subjective decisions to relate (for example, objects) depend not only on the cognitive apparatus, but also on language and cultural affordances as represented by the different semiotic systems and practices. It is argued that reversal patterns of figure-ground asymmetries and the various degrees of specificity (see below) indicate a human capacity for constructing and relating objects in space independent of phenomenological cues in the objective world, but rather based on implicit knowledge structures, i.e., mental models (Thiering 2011, 2013). Therefore, this process of ascribing meaning to a visual situation depends not only on objectively given features such as buildings,

82

2.7 Figure-ground constructions

walls, cities, rivers and mountains, but subjective and pragmatic encoding decisions as well.
In cognitive semantics this shift of aspects of semantic foci is seen in the different ascriptions of phenomenological figure-ground relations. Visual aspects can shift depending on the speaker/hearer’s focus and his/her construction of a spatial situation. Rubin states that
dazu ist der Nachweis erforderlich, daß wirklich ein ansehnlicher Unterschied zwischen dem besteht, was bei ein und derselben objektiven Figur erlebt wird, wenn ein Feld, das bei einer Gelegenheit als Figur bezw. Grund, bei einer anderen Gelegenheit als Grund bezw. Figur erlebt wird. (Rubin 1921: § 4, 31)
Rubin basically seeks to prove the difference between figure-ground asymmetries and their reversals. Why does a figure becomes a figure at a certain point, while at another point the same figure functions as a ground or reference point? This shift in meaning was also examined by the later Wittgenstein, among others. Wittgenstein differentiates between Aspektsehen and Aspektblindheit (Wittgenstein 2006: Part II: 213). He claims that Aspektsehen and Aufleuchten eines Aspekts are different processes (Wittgenstein 2006: Part II). I would also add that these are indeed different perceptual cognitive processes which intersect.
Gestalt theory processes and universal laws of perception are still employed in phenomenological approaches, but are now complemented by background information on the speaker and attention span. Wittgenstein already points to the fact that universal laws do not suffice in encoding spatial relations. He also adds certain criteria of experience with the perceived object. His duck-rabbit head example taken from the gestalt psychologist Jastrow, originally published in 1899, highlights this fact perfectly. We perceive either a duck or a rabbit, but never both aspects at once. We can say that the phenomenological aspect is a dazwischen, an “inbetween” the aspects, an oscillating of aspects. In fact, we might perceive neither of the aspects unless we are prompted, “what (else) do you see?”. So context and cultural expectations trigger different aspects and consequently different figure-ground settings. This is an extension of classic gestalt theory approaches that is important to implicit knowledge structures and spatial mental models in my approach.
There is one additional component to this survey which is crucial in deciding between figure or ground: embodied cognition. Rohrer states that the most general definition of embodiment is that “the human physical, cognitive, and social embodiment ground our conceptual and linguistic systems” (Rohrer 2007: 27). Furthermore, Johnson argues

Chapter 2: Cognitive representation of knowledge: spatial mental models

83

that human bodily movement, manipulation of objects, and perceptual interactions involve recurring patterns without which our experience would be chaotic and incomprehensible […]. (Johnson 1987: xix)
As stated in the introduction, these recurring patterns are known as “image schemas”, and they function as abstract structures of mental images.63 Mental models, as defined by Renn and Damerow (2007), have the advantage that they present knowledge structures, and changes thereto, as diachronic processes. They are therefore dynamic systems and, as JohnsonLaird argues, not reduced to propositional or syllogistic knowledge (Johnson-Laird 1983).
In addressing the linguistic parsing of spatial relations, the next section introduces the concept of degree of specificity, or the morphosyntactic and semantic detail used in encoding spatial relations. This question of degree is here particularly applied to measurement of distances.

2.8 Degree of specificity
Human beings are embedded in shared cultural practices in a specific culture (Zlatev 1997, 2010; see also Johnson 1987). Naturally, this is echoed by situated embodiment and distributed cognition. Linguistically such situated embodiment constructions are represented morphosyntactically. As such, one phenomenon explored in more detail is the abovementioned degree of specificity regarding the figure’s location with respect to the ground (Svorou 1993; Thiering 2013a; see below). This degree of specificity, or semantic granularity, relates to the amount of detailed expressive morphosyntactic content with which figure-ground asymmetries describe spatial relations in various languages and texts. As an example, Svorou argues that the English prepositional phrase “on the door” has a lower degree of specificity compared to “on the left side of the door” (Svorou 1993: 6–8; see also Langacker 2008: 19, 43, 55–57; Ameka 2006: 371 for an example in Ewe). The latter specification encodes further partitions of the door into smaller regions (Thiering 2011, 2013).
Through their language, or rather language affordances, speakers are required to depict a visual scene in a highly specific and often highly contextualized way. These affordances are the semantic content encoded via specific morphosyntactic devices (Gibson 1986: 127–143). This is even
"""""""""""""!
63 As we have seen, cognitive psychology invokes other concepts, such as cognitive maps, idealized cognitive models, frames, mental models, slots and scripts, each with a different focus of knowledge representation (Anderson 1990; Knauff 2013; Neisser 1976; Schanks and Abelson 1977;).

84

2.9 Mental models as cognitive maps: orientation as implicit spatial reasoning

more relevant when considering the impact of different semiotic systems in a culture. The ability to preserve knowledge via such symbols (texts, itineraries, instruments, travellers reports, maps, practices, etc.) enables us to construct different mental models for instance, for orientation.
With a more synchronic point of view, Malotki presents various facets of the Hopi language, encoding spatial relations and demonstrating various degrees of specificity (Malotki 1979; Svorou 1993; Thiering 2013a).64 As we have seen, this linguistic phenomenon of the figure’s location with respect to the ground is related to the amount of detailed expressive content with which spatial relations are described in various languages (Svorou 1993). Malotki states that Hopi uses a fine-grained linguistic system to encode spatial relations and that its spatial concepts also differ, to a certain degree, from most other languages (Malotki 1979: 293). The study of these fine-grained structures in different sources is my point of departure for analyzing spatial mental models.
It should come as no surprise that different languages and cultures offer language-specific affordances, that is, the semantic content hard-wired into specific morphosyntactic devices or patterns. These patterns are a verbal manifestation of mental models. As such, spatial concepts are linguistically represented in different forms, which are rooted in the respective language system.
Different semiotic encoding systems and oral presentations present crucial environment-dependent encoding patterns mirrored in implicit knowledge structures. Lakes, mountains, rivers, walls, buildings, bridges and cities are significant limitations in various cultures. Note the difference between small-scale (buildings, walls) and large-scale orientation (between cities). These limitations have repercussions for language patterns and the carving-up of spatial concepts at the language level.

2.9 Mental models as cognitive maps: orientation as implicit spatial reasoning
It is believed that travellers, and navigators for that matter, locate their current position on the Earth’s surface symbolically within spatial mental models, or more specifically, cognitive maps.
Orientation in the environment which relies on toponyms or landmarks, for example, requires the traveller to mentally compare the direc-

tion of travel toward the destination with a reference orientation in the respective cognitive map. The process of dead reckoning is of particular interest here since I believe that orientation, and certain techniques of navigation and pilotage, are similar to spatial mental models found in other spatial domains. Navigating without instruments requires recording distance and maintaining course based on wind directions, reefs, tides, birds, visible islands, but particularly etak systems (the following webpage from the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) provides an excellent overview: http://www.penn.museum/sites/navigation/intro.html).
According to Hutchins, etak systems are not distance measures, but rather temporal measurements (spatial duration; Hutchins 1996: 87–88; see also Gladwin 1970). The etak is based on the sidereal compass, an abstract construction of star positions. A specific mental model for the required journey is adapted to actual conditions (winds, visibility, etc.). The sidereal compass provides directional frames of reference, but also enables the traveller to envision a third island as a reference point. The star compass divides the great circle of the horizon into 32 points named for the stars (with the exception of Polaris) which rise and set at those points. These 32 points form a sidereal star compass which provides the system of reference for organizing all directional information about winds, currents, ocean swells, and the relative positions of islands, shoals, reefs and other seamarks (Gladwin 1970; Goodenough 1953; Hutchins 1996; Riesenberg 1972; Sarfert 1911). The diametrically opposite points of this compass are seen as connecting in straight lines through a central point. A navigator thinks of himself, or of any location from which he is determining directions, as this central point. So whenever he faces a compass point, there is a reciprocal point at his back.
The third island (or emergency island, or phantom island depending on the researcher) is a reference point used to determined distance travelled. It is over the horizon and out of sight of the first two islands that serve as reference points. As Hutchins points out, this system of encoding distance travelled “in terms of the changing bearing of a reference island is called etak” (Hutchins 1996: 70; emphasis original). The navigator knows the star bearings for the different inter-island routes in the relevant area. He also knows the star bearings of the reference island from his point of origin and the bearing of the reference island from his destination. So the navigator conceptualizes the reference island with reference to a particular star (keeping in mind the sidereal compass)
and moves back abeam of the canoe during the voyage through a succession of star bearings until the canoe reaches its destination, at which time the reference
