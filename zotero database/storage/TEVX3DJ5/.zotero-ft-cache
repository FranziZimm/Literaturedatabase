preface to the 2000 edition
Images and Signs
M I A most grateful to my publisher for inviting me to write a new Preface to this
book, for though Art and Illusion has now been around for some forty years, I have found that its title has misled some people to think that I value, or even
advocate, illusionistic paintings. There can be no such misunderstanding of its
subtitle, A Study in the Psychology of Pictorial Representation, for this is in-
deed what the book is about. Anyone who has ever attempted to draw a likeness of a friend, or to sit down in front of a motif to reproduce it faithfully on paper or
canvas, will have had experience of the psychological problems which are here involved. What the ancient Greeks called mimesis (the imitation of nature) has proved a difficult task: it took the artists of the ancient world some 250 years of systematic research to achieve this end, and artists of the Renaissance took the same time before they were able to eliminate what Albrecht Diirer called "false-
ness" in pictures.
But this commonsense interpretation of the history of Western art has recently been attacked on the ground that the whole idea of mimesis, truth to nature, is a will-o'-the-wisp, a vulgar error. There never was an image that looked like nature; all images are based on conventions, no more and no less than is language or the characters of our scripts. All images are signs, and the discipline
— that must investigate them is not the psychology of perception as I had be— lieved but semiotics, the science of signs. 1
I have little doubt that this reaction is connected with the radical transforma-
tion the visual arts have undergone in the past century, when mimesis was indeed rejected as a worthy aim of art. But it seems to me a little rash to assert that what
— you do not like does not exist after all, it was precisely in this century that what
we call the "entertainment industry" became instead the provider of illusions, and
pursued this aim systematically and with increasing success.
Many readers will have experienced the coming of color television and its psychological and social effects. To be sure, people had been enchanted with their black and white television sets, but the more they became habituated to its images, the more they were apparently captivated by the addition of color that approximates the image even more closely to reality. The value attached to this

XXVI

PREFACE TO THE 2000 EDITION

— new invention was not only expressed in the different license fees "penny plain

— and tuppence colored" it also created a new demand which the black and white

no longer satisfied. It lacked an element that could, and therefore should, be

there, and those who had to do without it felt "deprived" and disadvantaged.

Families have been known to go without necessities in order to indulge in this

advance, which is also a status symbol. Surely it is worth investigating the psycho-

logical factors involved.

Remember also the improvements in the gramophone industry since the time

of Edison's contraption, immortalized in the logo of His Master's Voice, to the
developments of CD and stereo, which claim to transport us directly to the concert hall. I am old enough even to recall the times when, as a schoolboy, I saw

movies in the cinema in which the dialogue had to be read on the screen between
— the sequences of actions. Later I experienced the sensation in every sense of — the word of the first "talkies," when Al Jolson first intoned his tear-jerker

Sonny-Boy. Then came "glorious technicolor" and the various experiments with

three-dimensional films.

Meanwhile, of course, technical developments in the creation of illusions

made much further progress. Simulators were developed for the training of pilots, who put on a helmet through which their eyes were fed the appearance of an

environment rushing past, which they were asked to control. More recently, so-

called "virtual reality" has been perfected, which allows us not only to see and

hear an invented reality but even to touch it with specially constructed gloves. I
do not know whether this device will, or can become a medium of art; all that

matters in the present context is the undeniable evidence that images can be

approximated to the experience of reality.
Is the same also true of signs? Long before the gurus of Paris made semiology

fashionable, a much greater mind had seen to what extent art can be approached

as a system of signs. The mind was that of William Shakespeare. In quoting from

the Prologue to Henry V, I shall try to throw some fresh light on the problem broached, but obviously not solved, in Art and Illusion:

But pardon, gentles all, The flat unraised spirit, that hath dared
On this unworthy scaffold, to bring forth So great an object: Can this cockpit hold The vasty fields of France? or may we cram Within this wooden O, the very casques
That did affright the air at Agincourt?

PREFACE TO THE 2000 EDITION
0, pardon! since a crooked figure may
Attest, in little place, a million;
And let us, ciphers to this great accompt, On your imaginary forces work. . . .
Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts . . .
And make imaginary puissance: Think, when we talk of horses that you see them . . .

XXV11

To come down from these dizzy heights, let us remember that the Prologue is indeed talking about signs, not images. The word "horse," of course, is a conventional sign, so that only those who have learned the language can obey the playwright's injunction to see a horse when the actor talks of one. There was a famous film made of the play, with Laurence Olivier as Henry V, where we could actually
see the horses "printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth."
Not only can we see such sights on the cinema screen, but we cannot help seeing them, unless we close our eyes. The film exploits the weakness, or sluggishness, of our vision to make us see movement where there is only a succession
of stills. We do not have to mobilize our imagination; we are the passive, though
willing, victims of an inescapable illusion.
Admittedly, there will always be some who will rebel against such enslavement of their senses, people who may even prefer to read Shakespeare's play at home rather than have their imagination clash with that of a film director or theatrical producer; and, who can blame them, considering the way unsolicited intruders often impose their vision on the play? And yet, seeing a tolerable production on the stage still differs from reading. It may not compel our senses in the way the film compels them, but a performance certainly assists our imagination,
or, to recall Shakespeare's words, our "imaginary forces."
Very crudely then, the film may reduce our expenditure of mental energy, and it may be classed among the countless labor-saving devices with which tech-
nology has provided us, from the invention of the wheel to the pocket calculator.
Here we may also find the reason why moralists and aestheticians have so
regularly opposed or resisted any step in the direction of illusion. Perhaps they
are right; we should rather keep our mental energy in trim than let others do the work for us. After all, there are social institutions which must remain immune from labor-saving devices: I refer to games and to sport, of which the very func-
tion is to test and exercise our mental and physical energies. Apparently there are no such taboos in the nursery. The kind of make-believe
we all call playing does not resist the artifice of the toy industry, of dogs which

XXV1U

PREFACE TO THE 2000 EDITION

can bark and wag their tails, or dolls which can say "mama." The child can happily

play without these expensive aids, but once they are on the market, children long

for them.

The link between play and art has often been made. For me it is an important

reminder of the fact that illusions must be kept distinct from false beliefs. After

all, children can distinguish between dolls and babies, and few people sitting in

the theater believe that there is Prospero's island immediately adjoining the audi-

torium. Yet, if there is a sudden announcement referring to an alarm or a change

in the cast, we may need a moment of adjustment to remember where we are.

The best example I know of this experience comes not from the normal stage

but from the puppet theater. Those of us who have watched such a performance

may remember that the more involved we became, the more our imagination took

over, until we forgot that what was in front of us was tiny puppets. They grew to

normal size, as it were. But suddenly, what looked like a gigantic hand appeared

among the strings and, for a moment at least, we had to adjust our perception,

since the scale of the puppets had become our norm.
I am fond of this example because it so dramatically demonstrates the influ-

ence that our expectations can have on our perceptions. No medium of art could

function if it did not so influence our perceptions through the expectations that

are set up, and if it did not, in Shakespeare's words, "work on our imaginary

forces," and "piece out its imperfections with our thoughts."

Psychology describes this form of perceptual tuning by the term mental set,

a form of selective attention, which is described in ordinary parlance as the differ-

ence between looking and seeing, listening and hearing. Without such a filtering

device we would be overwhelmed by the myriad stimuli that reach us from the

outer world. I have a good deal to say about this phenomenon in the pages that
— follow notably at the end of the Introduction and in the chapter on "Conditions — of Illusion" but I believe it will not be unhelpful if I here return to the topic, for

it is precisely this process and this possibility that is missed by the semiotic ap-

proach to images. To put it briefly, I believe that the difference between signs and

images rests in the different mental set we have to adopt for their understanding.

my It suits

purpose that one of the most intelligent artists of our century,

Magritte, liked to meditate on this difference. In his painting of two framed can-
vases, one is just a blue patch, the other says "del." The first, we may say, is an

image, the second, signs. In the terminology of the American philosopher Charles

Pierce, the image can also be described as an iconic sign, because it has some-

thing in common with its meaning or denotation, the blue color. The word "del"

is a non-iconic sign; its meaning is purely conventional, and so are the four

letters of which it is composed. If we had not learned French, and if we had not learned the Western alphabet, we could only guess at the meaning. Could we
necessarily guess that the blue patch represents the sky? Hardly. It might be a
sample of a material, or of a paint, but in conjunction with the word "ciel" we would rightly reject such quibbles. Once we are alerted, we recognize the sky. Not that this prevents us from distinguishing between more or less faithful, more
or less convincing renderings of the sky that we know from the history of art. We
do not normally expect the word "ciel" to be more or less like the sky. The meaning of signs is conveyed not by their overall appearance, but by
what are called distinctive features. Among our capital letters, every vertical
stroke with two horizontal strokes typifies an "F," regardless of size, color or shape. It is characteristic of signs in general that they rely on such distinctive features, the rest being irrelevant. Karl Biihler speaks of abstractive relevance
here.- In reading we are set to pick out these relevant features quite automat-
— ically so automatically, I believe, that we may be slightly surprised to find that
the only difference between Ear and Far is one small, horizontal stroke. Even so,
one group of signs says Ear, the other Far. We are so conditioned by our mental
set when we read that these squiggles are associated with the sounds of the
English language.
The meaning of the four characters PAIN is obvious to us when confirmed by the sequence spelling TROUBLE. However, if the same four characters are fol-
lowed by ET COUVERT, and if we are at all conditioned to switching to French,
we shall read "pain et couvert" as it is seen on a menu. Ambiguities of this kind turn out to be a useful testing ground for observing the mechanism we are after, since the need to switch our mental set tends to make us aware of its power.
Shakespeare was obviously in a semiotic mood when he wrote the Prologue to Henry V, which prompted him to describe the Globe as a "wooden O." As far as I
know, actors habitually pronounce this description by the vowel "o" (as in Globe), but is it not more likely that the sign on the page should be read as "naught" after all, the Prologue then goes on to speak of "figures" and "ciphers," which applies to a zero,' but not to a vowel? Normally the two meanings of the upright
oval on the page are unlikely to bother us, but we can always construct a se-
quence of signs that trips up our mental set, so that the meaning remains unresolved. Should ^£1023 be read as two vowels and four figures, or as four vowels
and two figures? Only the context can decide. Not that we must read any oval as a sign. A string of ovals can also be an ornament purely used for decoration, as in
this case:
0000. But add the word "PLUM" underneath pi^ and you transform the

mental set: the oval no longer appears to stand on a neutral background, it is
surrounded by an infinite halo of space, because we expect plums to be solid, and

the suggestion of a foreshortened stalk and leaves : u\

The difference between images and signs, then, does not lie in the degree of iconicity or conventionality. Images can function as signs as soon as they are
recognized. We need only think of the labels on cans to realize that a perfect
iconic image can function as a sign; but experience also shows that where the
— — image is used as a sign as in heraldry, trademarks, or travel guides [P.i] it
tends to become increasingly conventionalized. In the history of human civilization, signs and images tend to have a common
ancestry. Most scripts started out as pictograms, as rudimentary images, and
there are several instances allowing us to observe how the needs of their users gradually modified them into signs, exhibiting merely select distinctive features,
like the letters of our alphabet. Here is a series of Chinese signs to be read from
right to left [P. 2]: The top row shows how the pictogram for mountains became
the current character for mountain. The next, a horse with four legs, was turned into the character for horse unknown to Shakespeare. The next is a diagrammatic image of a chariot. Something analogous happened to the Egyptian hieroglyphs,

XXXU

PREFACE TO THE 2000 EDITION

when the need for fluency and speed turned them first into hieratic, and then into

demotic script.

Was it not the mental set looking for distinctive features in reading that

turned the images into signs? And might not a different mental set have led to the

opposite effect? There is a chapter in Art and Illusion entitled "Reflections on

the Greek Revolution" which suggests such a development. Meanwhile I have
come across a passage in Herodotus that appears to confirm my reading: 4 Her-

odotus tells us that the Egyptians considered Pan to be one of the eight gods that

existed before the other twelve, and that their artists represented him (Pan)

exactly as the Greeks do, with the head and legs of a goat. "They so represent

him," Herodotus assures us, "not because they really think he looks like that.

On the contrary, they do not believe him to look different from the other gods,
— but that is how they depict him why, I prefer not to say."

/

What interests me in this passage is not so much whether Herodotus' report

— is correct I know of many Egyptian gods with animal heads, but I have never

seen one with the feet of a goat. What excites me is the fact that the Greek

historian obviously took it for granted that the image of a god shows us what he

looks like, but that his Egyptian informants had told him that, at least in one case,

they did not share this assumption; in fact, it was a conventional sign.

It is interesting to reflect that, at the time Herodotus wrote this, one of the

most famous cult images of the ancient world took shape: the Zeus at Olympia.
We have no copies of that work, except for a poor rendering on a Roman coin, but

we have a good many literary sources, which tend to confirm that the Zeus made

by Pheidias was felt to evoke his majestic presence. Indeed, the remark recorded

by a Roman writer of the impression the statue made on a Roman general sums

up this feeling: "When he saw Jove as if he were present he was moved in his

heart."

("Iovem

velut

praesentem

intuens

motus

animo

5
est.")

No doubt, in his lost statue, Pheidias had not omitted what we may call the
— "distinctive features" of the god his traditional attributes, such as the thunder-

bolt and the eagle. But he turned the sign into an image by conveying the divinity

of the Lord of Olympus through his physiognomy, reflecting, as we read, the

famous description of the god in Homer, where his nod shakes Olympus.

That such powers were indeed expected of artists is again confirmed by a

near-contemporary, in the Memorabilia of Xenophon, where we encounter Soc-

rates in conversation with a sculptor. He makes him admit that the artist's task

can never be simply to imitate the physical features, but that he must also repre-

sent "the action of the soul" (te erga psyches)." My point is again that it requires a
— — very different mental set a different tuning to respond to this achievement

than it does to recognize the distinctive features of a script or the attributes of a
cult image. The first is a finite task that is soon performed, the second is what we
would call "open-ended," for it mobilizes our imagination. It was what I have described in the chapter concerned as a chain reaction
that led ultimately to that perfection of mimesis of which we read in the accounts of Pliny and others. One of the effects that might still be mentioned here was the
rise of two genres in Greek literature which are linked to the visual arts: the
epigram on works of art, of which The Anthology has preserved so many charm-
ing examples, and the rhetorical exercise of ekphrasis, the interpretation of real or fictitious images in ornate and vivid prose. Both genres like to dwell on illu-
sionistic effects with hyperbolic praise, but we should pause before we dismiss this reaction: Whenever a current style is modified in the direction of realism, our
mental set over-reacts; it is the unexpected degree of realism that will surprise
and captivate contemporaries, much as we have observed in our entertainment
industry.
What is left of ancient murals and floor mosaics amply confirms the high esteem in which illusionistic tricks were held in the ancient world. The Roman architect Vitruvius thoroughly approved of such illusionistic wall paintings, which he called "imitations based on reality," but he opposed what was then a new fashion for "Stalks instead of columns and curled leaves instead of gables. . . .
Such things," he says rightly, "neither are, nor can be. How can a reed sustain a
roof or a slender stalk a seated statue?"7 Evidently Vitruvius was so habituated to seeing wall paintings as mimesis of an imaginary reality that he was unable to switch to the decorative play of forms and serpents we call "grotesques."
In Art and Illusion, I merely alluded to developments that spelt the end of
classical art, but it goes without saying that the mental set expecting mimesis was in conflict with the new religion of Christianity, that had inherited from the Jews the injunction of the Decalogue: "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven
— image or any likeness of any thing" an injunction which was especially aimed at
the fashioning of idols.
The tensions created by the new faith and some of the compromises they
generated are far too complex and elusive to be discussed in our particular context. In religious and mystical usage, the distinction between sign and image can be obviated in the symbol which the contemplating mind regards as the image of
— a transcendent reality an inexhaustible plenitude of meanings seen through a
glass darkly. 8
The complexity of these issues is best illustrated through a passage in the writings of Dionysius the Areopagite, who, referring to the description in Revela-

tion of the Throne of the Lord supported by a lion, an ox, an eagle, and an
— angel four creatures which have always been interpreted by the Church as sym— bolizing the four Evangelists comments that such shocking symbols were used
deliberately to prevent us from thinking that we might see a true likeness of those heavenly beings, as might happen were they described as radiant figures clad in
shining robes.
The same rejection of mimesis is also implied in the famous formula of Pope Gregory the Great, that "painting presents to the illiterate what writing offers to those who can read." The mental set that this formula required was bound to result in the transformation of images into conventional signs. As far as such a generalization can be applied, this is indeed what happened in the early Middle Ages, until the pendulum swung back and the image again replaced the sign.
Many years ago Emil Male" suggested that the role I assigned to drama in the .ancient world was performed by the preachers of the mendicant orders in the
thirteenth century, asking the audience to visualize the Bible and legendary events. If this mental set led to a great escalation of illusionistic devices, it would help to explain the development of the arts from Cimabue to Michelangelo, familiar, and over-familiar to art historians from Vasari's Lives.
Our age has tended to dismiss Vasari's idea of progress as naive triumphalism, but has he really made it all up? He tells us, in a characteristic passage, how Francesco Francia and Pietro Perugino had overcome that "certain dryness of
manner" that marked the style of earlier masters, so that "people ran like mad to
see that novel and live beauty and thought that it would never be possible to do better. But," Vasari goes on, "their error was clearly shown up through the work
of Leonardo da Vinci, who truly imparted to his figures breath and movement." Once more I venture to compare these reactions with those triumphs of the
entertainment industry that I mentioned at the beginning of this Preface. But this
very analogy may also prompt us to reflect on the reasons which increasingly led
to the divorce between the fine arts and the artifices of science.
There is a passage in John Constable's correspondence which seems to me immensely telling in this respect. Constable was one of my principal witnesses in Art and Illusion because of his ability and his dogged determination to get rid of
— — all second-hand conventions or what he called "manner" and to achieve a
maximum fidelity to natural appearances. In 1823 Constable visited a sensational display, the diorama constructed by Daguerre, later the inventor of the daguer-
rotype. "It is in part a transparency," he wrote, "the spectator is in a dark chamber, and it is very pleasing and has great illusion. It is outside the pale of art because its object is deception. The art pleases by reminding, not deceiving." 1 "

PREFACE TO THE 2000 EDITION

— "Outside the pale of art" what could he have meant by that pale, or limit?
Would we go quite wrong in suggesting that, for Constable, art had become something like a game of skill, with its own rules, which must be kept free of laborsaving devices? To deceive the eye is to cheat, for the painter must please by reminding, just as the playwright of Shakespeare's Prologue must work on our

"imaginary forces." Fidelity to nature has to be achieved within the limits of the
medium. Once this compact between the artist and the beholder is destroyed, we are outside the pale of art. Indeed, as soon as Daguerre's and Fox Talbot's mechanical methods entered the field, art had to shift the goalposts, and move the

pale elsewhere.
An anecdote about Matisse which I quote in Art and Illusion, sums it all up: When a lady, looking at one of his portraits, told him that the arm of the woman was too long, he replied: "Madam, you are mistaken, this is not a woman, this is a painting." No wonder Matisse's contemporary, the art dealer Daniel Kahnweiler,

wrote that paintings should be seen as signs, and not as illusory objects: "Elle (la
peinture) ne se justifie que si on la considere comme une creation de signes et

non d'objets feints.""

PREFACE
W N H E I was honored by an invitation to deliver the A. W. Mellon Lectures in
the Fine Arts, at the National Gallery in Washington, I proposed as my subject
the psychology of representation. I was very grateful to the Trustees for agreeing to a field of inquiry that extends beyond the frontiers of art to the study of perception and optical illusion. For the mysterious way in which shapes and marks can be made to signify and suggest other things beyond themselves had
intrigued me since my student days. In my book The Story of Art, I had sketched
the development of representation from the conceptual methods of the primitives
and the Egyptians, who relied on "what they knew," to the achievements of the impressionists, who succeeded in recording "what they saw." While thus making
use of the traditional distinction between "knowing" and "seeing," I ventured to
suggest in my last chapter that the self-contradictory nature of the impressionist
program contributed to the collapse of representation in twentieth-century art.
My assertions to the effect that no artist can "paint what he sees" and discard all
conventions were of necessity somewhat aphoristic and dogmatic. To clarify and substantiate them I had to re-examine the very theory of perception I had found so serviceable. This book is a record of this re-examination. It does not aim at upsetting the previous interpretation but at justifying and refining it in the light of contemporary work in psychology. The earlier book, in short, applied a tradi-
tional hypothesis about the nature of vision to the history of representational
styles; this book has the more ambitious aim of using the history of art, in its turn, to probe and test the hypothetical framework itself. Thus I had to assume that the reader would know the main phases of representational styles which are
described in the earlier book. No more specialized knowledge than that is required. Even less do I assume a knowledge of psychology, for in this field I am
myself a layman and a learner. In stressing this fact, however, I do not want to sound unduly apologetic. As I see it, the great purpose for which the A. W. Mellon Lectures were founded was to keep the discussion of art in flux and to advance the subject. I believe we can do so only if we learn from the artists to shun the
ready-made and to take intellectual risks. All I promised my understanding
audience in Washington was not to play safe.

PREFACE

The seven lectures I gave in the spring of 1956 were entitled "The Visible

World and the Language of Art." All of them are incorporated in this book, the

majority with only slight changes (Chapters 1, in, x, xi). Of the remaining three,

one survives in a considerably extended form as Chapter rx; the other two have

expanded into several chapters and constitute sections of Chapters n and v, vn
and vni respectively. A good deal of supplementary matter also came from

lectures on this general topic which I gave at various times during my tenure of

the Slade Professorship at Oxford, at various institutions of the University of

London to which I belong, during a visit to Harvard University, and at the annual

congress of the British Psychological Society in Durham in 1955, where I out-
lined my program of research.

Such a process of expansion was probably inevitable as soon as the material

here presented was released from the tyranny of the clock. Indeed, my main

difficulty was to make the underlying argument sufficiently explicit without

allowing every chapter to swell into a volume. Despite much recasting and

rewriting, therefore, I decided to take advantage of the lecture form, which

enjoys the privilege of leaving stones unturned and avenues unexplored. It also

encourages the optimistic assumption that the reader will settle down in a chair,

as the listener has to, and will follow the arguments and the illustrations in the

sequence in which they are presented. For it should be clear by now that this is

not a picture book with explanatory letterpress. It is reading matter with ex-

planatory pictures. The publishers have spared no effort to keep the illustrations

close to the passage which they support. The arrangement of the notes serves a

We similar purpose.

don't interrupt our lectures, as a rule, to bombard the

audience with bibliographical data. I have kept the references out of the reader's

sight and assembled all the notes at the end, referring back to the pagination of

the text and to the topic there discussed. Any reader looking for chapter and

verse or seeking the way to further literature should find it easy to spot the

relevant information. The full titles of books sometimes cited in a shortened

form are listed at the end.
It was no lack of gratitude toward the authors I have used which made me

thus remove the titles of their works from immediate view. On the contrary, I

should like at this point to acknowledge my profound indebtedness to the self-

denying work of those experts, who must have sacrificed years of their lives and

much rewarding research to make their knowledge available to nonspecialists.

The fact, for instance, that the notes contain some of the quoted passages in the

original language and that I have sometimes used my own translations should

not obscure my indebtedness to the editors and translators of the Loeb Classical

Library. Nor should an occasional reference to individual papers in psychological
periodicals hide my dependence on the books which stood on my shelf through-
out the time of writing: I have in mind such indispensable surveys as C. E. Osgood, Method and Theory in Experimental Psychology (1953), R. S. Woodworth and Harold Schlosberg, Experimental Psychology (1954), and also the
compact, small volume by O. L. Zangwill, An Introduction to Modern Psychology (1950). Among specialized studies of vision, M. D. Vernon, A Further Study of
Visual Perception (1952), presents an admirable conspectus, while Wolfgang Metzger, Gesetze des Sehens (2nd edn., 1953), surveys the whole field from the
point of view of the Gestalt school. I also owe much to Ralph M. Evans, An
Introduction to Color (1948), but most of all to J. J. Gibson, The Perception of
the Visual World (1950), which, I hope, prevented me from underrating what
the author calls "the awe-inspiring intricacy of vision."
Even closer to the fringe of my intellectual horizon I hope to have profited
from D. O. Hebb, The Organization of Behavior (1949), Viktor von Weizsacker, Der Gestaltkreis (1950), F. H. Allport, Theories of Perception and the Concept of Structure (1955), and most of all, perhaps, F. A. Hayek, The Sensory Order
(1952).
The enumeration of books representing different schools of psychology will
arouse, in the mind of the specialist, the suspicion that my approach must be fundamentally eclectic. Up to a point this suspicion would be justified, but my
selection was not without a bias of its own. If any student of the subject should wish to know at this stage what direction this bias took, I would refer him to the famous joint paper by E. C. Tolman and E. Brunswik, "The Organism and the Causal Texture of Environment," Psychological Review, 1935, which stresses the
hypothetical character of all perceptual processes.
It so happens that I saw this paper only after having completed my book.
I do not mention this fact in order to claim originality; I rather want to emphasize the part played by living traditions in the shaping of our selective interests. The paper was written in Vienna in 1934, at a time when I had some fleeting
contact with Egon Brunswik, who kindly served as a subject in a series of
experiments on the reading of facial expressions in art which I helped to organize
under the direction of my late friend Ernst Kris. Above all it was Ernst Kris, the
art historian turned psychoanalyst, who, during a friendship lasting more than
twenty years, taught me the fruitfulness of a psychological approach. Our joint research into the problem of caricature first brought me up against the question
of what is involved in accepting an image as a likeness. The basic results of our research are embodied in an essay in his book Psychoanalytic Explorations in

PREFACE

Art ( I 952), on which I have drawn in these chapters. What the printed word can hardly convey was the passion and versatility of his ever-inquiring mind, to which I owe the conviction that the history of art will become sterile unless it is constantly enriched by a close contact with the study of man.
It was in the same years, before Hitler's occupation of Vienna, that I was fortunate enough to meet Karl R. Popper, who had just published his book The Logic of Scientific Discovery (Eng. tr., 1959), in which he established the priority of the scientific hypothesis over the recording of sense data. Any
acquaintance I may have with problems of scientific method and philosophy I
owe to his constant friendship. I should be proud if Professor Popper's influence were to be felt everywhere in this book, though naturally he is not responsible
for its many shortcomings.
It was from Dr. Gottfried Spiegler, an X-ray physicist, that I learned to see the interpretation of all images as a philosophical problem. Professor Wolfgang
Kohler generously gave me of his time in Princeton and reassured me that the
complex questions encountered in the practice of art are still of potential interest to psychological research. Professor Richard Held, of Brandeis University,
elucidated several points and introduced me to the department of psychology at Princeton University, where I saw the Ames Demonstrations. Oskar Kokoschka, who invited me to speak at the "School of Seeing" at the Salzburg Summer Academy, convinced me that the mysteries of perception can still fascinate a great artist of our time. Conversations with Professor Roman Jakobson, of Harvard
University, and with Professor Colin Cherry, of the Imperial College of Science
in London, have given me tantalizing glimpses into the exciting fields of linguistic
theory and information theory.
Naturally I cannot enumerate all my immediate colleagues at the Warburg Institute and the Slade School of Art of the University of London to whom I owe
stimulation and encouragement. But I should at least like to mention those who
kindly read the manuscript of this book at various stages and offered suggestions for its improvement : they are Professor Ian Bialostocki, Professor Gertrud Bing, Professor Harry Bober, Mr. B. A. R. Carter (who also contributed diagrams), Professor Philipp Fehl, Mrs. Ellen Kann, Mr. H. Lester Cooke, Miss Jennifer Montagu, Mr. Michael Podro, and Mrs. Ruth Rubinstein. Mr. William McGuire
at the publishing end and my wife and my son Richard on this side helped
nursing the book and its author. For permission to quote in the text I acknowledge gratefully as follows: to

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION

CHANGESin the body of the book are restricted to a few corrections of fact
or of wording. Any major alterations would have thrown the careful layout

which so successfully dovetails text and illustrations fatally out of gear. But
I gladly accepted my publisher's invitation to write a Preface to this second

edition.
My first duty is surely to thank all those whose interest and understanding have made this reprinting necessary after less than a year. My second duty

would be to take account of all criticisms and to remove all sources of misunder-

standing that these may have revealed. I cannot do this in a preface, but I can

at least draw attention to a few of them. One such stumbling block is still the

rash assumption that a book on the rise of illusionist art must want to set up

my fidelity to nature as the standard of artistic perfection. If

disclaimers on

pages 7 and 8 did not suffice, my discussion of caricature and other nonillusionist

aspects of representation should have saved me from this misinterpretation. It

is an interesting and undeniable fact that many great artists of the past were

fascinated by problems of visual truth, but none of them can ever have thought that visual truth alone will make a picture into a work of art.
Another group of readers have sought support from this book for the opposite view according to which the demand for fidelity to nature must always

be meaningless since everybody sees nature differently. Actually I have tried to show (e.g., on pages 276 and 299) that the undeniable subjectivity of vision
does not preclude objective standards of representational accuracy. A wax dummy can be indistinguishable from its prototype, and a view through a peephole at a picture may look the same as the view at a solid object quite regardless
of who does the viewing or whether he admires or despises the trick. What may have caused this misunderstanding (apart from overstatements
on pages 38 and 49, which I have now rectified) is my repeated assertion that
no artist can copy what he sees. There is no contradiction here, for the success-

ful trompe l'ceil no less than the striking caricature are not only the result of

careful looking but also the fruit of experimentation with pictorial effects. The invention of these effects, as I have tried to show, was stimulated by the dis-

satisfaction which certain periods of Western civilization felt with images that

Xlii

PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION

failed to look convincing. It is the gTadual modification of the traditional sche-
matic conventions of image making under the pressure of novel demands that forms one of the main themes of the book.
Here I should perhaps point to a less obvious difficulty, which should, however, not be too hard for the reader to overcome. As an historian of art I took
the existence and frequency of such schematic vocabularies as my starting
point without demonstrating their character in detail. It lies in the nature of
this problem that it would need a disproportionate number of illustrations merely to show vast numbers of Egyptian servant figures, Chinese bamboo paintings, Byzantine madonnas, Gothic angels, or Baroque putti in order to prove what an
attentive look at museums and art books will confirm — how narrow is the range and how subtle are the variations within which the craftsmen and artists of
the past created their masterpieces. For the real purpose of this book is not to describe but to explain the reasons for the unexpected difficulty which artists
encountered who clearly wanted to make their images look like nature. I admit that this intention is not always easy to prove, and I am grateful
to one of my painter friends, who helped me to formulate my problem afresh by asking me to tell quite simply what would be the opposite of the view I hold.
It would be a state of affairs in which every person wielding a brush could always achieve fidelity to nature. The mere desire to preserve the likeness of a beloved person or of a beautiful view would then suffice for the artist to "copy
what he sees." Those would be right who regard all deviations from nature in non-naturalistic styles as intentional. This view looks plausible in our own world
because most city dwellers have absorbed a great deal of knowledge of pictorial
effects from posters and picture postcards. We have no right whatever to assume
a similar freedom of choice for those who cannot pick up the trick at second hand. I recently came across an episode in the memoirs of a painter that illustrates this point. Brought up among orthodox Jews in Poland who did not admit pictorial representations, Jehudo Epstein tells in Mein Weg von Ost nach West (Stuttgart, 1929) how pathetically he failed when he tried for the first time to sketch a castle on a hill in his home town and what a revelation it was to him when somebody then lent him a textbook on perspective.
To explain this need of the painter to profit from the experiences of preced-
ing generations I had to investigate in my turn the working of pictorial effects and to ask how they relate to the way we normally process the information that reaches us from the visible world in which we live and move. In my treatment
of this question, some philosophical critics from the neopositivist camp have
objected to my equation of seeing and interpreting. They fear, I suspect, that
this approach might undermine the faith in the reliability of sense observations

and thus give aid and comfort to their enemies. I do not share their apprehen-
sions, but I am not wedded to any form of words. I would be ready to substitute
another for the offensive term "interpretation," provided it described the same process of trial and error by which alone we weed out illusions and test and revise our beliefs about the world, in perception no less than in science. Perhaps I should have been a little more explicit in the presentation of this hypothesis,
since no critic has, to my knowledge, taken up the central arguments on pages
272 and 329. None of these discussions about perception will ever solve the mystery of
art. I do not believe that any book that claimed to do so could be worth reading.
The disappointment which a few critics seem to have felt when they discovered
the limited nature of my problem reflects, I fear, the immaturity of the study
of art as compared with the study of nature. Those who have made a little
progress in the understanding of the metabolism of the heart are rarely reproached nowadays for having failed to solve the mystery of life. Whether or not this book represents such progress in the understanding of pictorial represen-
tation and its history depends on the validity of its arguments. And so I return to the great debt of gratitude I owe the many readers whose willingness to enter into these arguments and to join in their examination surpassed my boldest
dreams.

NOTE FOR THE 1969 PRINTING
It would be a task beyond my powers to bring this book "up to date" by taking
account of all publications in psychology, in philosophy, and in the history of art
which may have a bearing on its argument. But the reader may like to know that the conclusion of my central chapter, "The Analysis of Vision in Art," for which I quoted an "aside" by Professor J. J. Gibson (p. 328), can now rest on the solid support of a closely reasoned book by that great student of perception, The Senses
Considered as Perceptual Systems (Boston, 1966). I should also like to draw attention to an important article I overlooked and to which I should have referred
in my attack on the idea of the "innocent eye": R. Blanche, "La Vision du peintre
et la psychologie de la perception," Journal de psychologie normale et pathologique, April-June, 1946, pp. 153-80. As for myself, I have reviewed some of the problems of this book from a slightly different vantage point in a lecture "Visual Discovery through Art" at Austin, Texas, published in Arts Magazine, November 1965.

NOTE FOR THE 1969 PRINTING

Not that there are no contradictions between these various approaches to
the same problems. On the contrary, many of the most basic questions raised by this book still remain open. My colleagues know that I am still apt to pounce on them in a College Common Room or Refectory and make them look with me
at some indifferent portrait of an academic worthy, not for the sake of its artistic merit, but to help sorting out what is going on when we look at such a painting.
They may have to walk with me from one corner of the room to the other in order to watch the apparent shift in the sitter's orientation, they may have to
try to screen off the frame with their hands and report on the degree to which
they "lose the surface" of the painting, they may be cross-examined about their capacity to remain aware of the picture plane while scrutinizing the make of the sitter's gown or the expression on his face. Strangely enough there is no agreement about the way these experiences should be described, though I have not been convinced that my account is much in need of revision. I believe, more-
over, that some of these questions could be amenable to experimental investiga-
tion. Should I hear of any conclusive results I venture to hope that I may be
able, one day, to refer to them in yet another Preface.

NOTE FOR THE 1972 PRINTING

It was somewhat incautious of me to write in November 1967 that a subsequent

Preface to this book might refer to "conclusive results." One of the great attrac-

tions of a lively field such as the psychology of perception is precisely that few

conclusions are likely to remain unchallenged for long. Happily, therefore, the

problems raised in this book are still live issues. I am engaged in a friendly

debate with Professor J. J. Gibson, to whose important work I referred in the

last Note, and whose most radical formulations I first ventured to question in

Gibson, in his turn, published an article, "On Information available in Pic-

exchange on pp. 195-199 and 308 of the same year. Meanwhile, I also wrote "The "What' and the 'How': Perspective Representation and the Phenomenal

World" for R. S. Rudner and I. Scheffler (editors), Logic and Art: Essays in

Honor of Nelson Goodman (Indianapolis, 1972), which I here cite because it

deals once more with the old teaser of the apparent shift in the orientation of

representations mentioned in the Preface to the Third Edition and offers an

explanation which I certainly regard as an improvement on what I wrote in

this book (pp. 276ff.). Whether or not it can be called a "conclusive result" will

be for others to say.

ART AND ILLUSION
A Study in the Psychology
of Pictorial Representation

INTRODUCTION
Psychology and the Riddle of Style
Art being a thing of the mind, it follows that any scientific study of
art will be psychology. It may be other things as well, but psychology
it will always be.
Max J. Friedlander, Von Kunst unci Kennerschaft
THE ILLUSTRATION in front of the reader should explain much
more quickly than I could in words what is here meant by the "riddle of style." Alain's cartoon neatly sums up a problem which has haunted the
minds of art historians for many generations. Why is it that different ages
and different nations have represented the visible world in such different
ways? Will the paintings we accept as true to life look as unconvincing
to future generations as Egyptian paintings look to us? Is everything concerned with art entirely subjective, or are there objective standards in such matters? If there are, if the methods taught in the life class today result
in more faithful imitations of nature than the conventions adopted by the Egyptians, why did the Egyptians fail to adopt them? Is it possible, as our cartoonist hints, that they perceived nature in a different way? Would not
such a variability of artistic vision also help us to explain the bewildering images created by contemporary artists?
These are questions which concern the history of art. But their answers cannot be found by historical methods alone. The art historian has done
his work when he has described the changes that have taken place. He is concerned with the differences in style between one school of art and

4

INTRODUCTION

another, and he has refined his methods of description in order to group,

organize, and identify the works of art which have survived from the

past. Glancing through the variety of illustrations we find in this book,

we all react, to a major or minor extent, as he does in his studies: we

take in the subject of a picture together with its style; we see a Chinese

landscape here and a Dutch landscape there, a Greek head and a seven-

have come to take such classifications so

much for granted that we have almost stopped asking why it is so easy to

tell whether a tree was painted by a Chinese or by a Dutch master. If

could not count on the fact that the boys in Alain's life

class would produce a typical Egyptian figure. Even less could we hope

to detect whether an Egyptian figure was indeed made three thousand

years ago or forged yesterday. The art historian's trade rests on the con-

viction once formulated by Wolfflin, that "not everything is possible in

every period." To explain this curious fact is not the art historian's duty,

but whose business is it?

II
there was a time when the methods of representation were the proper
concern of the art critic. Accustomed as he was to judging contemporary works first of all by standards of representational accuracy, he had no doubt that this skill had progressed from rude beginnings to the perfection of illusion. Egyptian art adopted childish methods because Egyptian artists knew no better. Their conventions could perhaps be excused, but they could not be condoned. It is one of the permanent gains we owe to the great artistic revolution which has swept across Europe in the first half of the twentieth century that we are rid of this type of aesthetics. The first prejudice teachers of art appreciation usually try to combat is the belief that artistic excellence is identical with photographic accuracy. The picture post card or pin-up girl has become the conventional foil against which the student learns to see the creative achievement of the great masters. Aesthetics, in other words, has surrendered

its claim to be concerned with the problem of convincing representation,

the problem of illusion in art. In certain respects this is indeed a libera-

tion, and nobody would wish to revert to the old confusion. But since

neither the art historian nor the critic still wishes to occupy himself with

this perennial problem, it has become orphaned and neglected. The im-

pression has grown up that illusion, being artistically irrelevant, must also

be psychologically very simple.
We do not have to turn to art to show that this view is erroneous. Any

psychology textbook will provide us with baffling examples that show the

complexity of the issues involved. Take the simple trick drawing which

can see the picture as either a

rabbit or a duck. It is easy to discover both readings. It is less easy to
describe what happens when we switch from one interpretation to the other. Clearly we do not have the illusion that we are confronted with a "real" duck or rabbit. The shape on the paper resembles neither animal very closely. And yet there is no doubt that the shape transforms itself in some subtle way when the duck's beak becomes the rabbit's ears and
brings an otherwise neglected spot into prominence as the rabbit's mouth.
I say "neglected," but does it enter our experience at all when we switch back to reading "duck"? To answer this question, we are compelled to look for what is "really there," to see the shape apart from its interpretation, and this, we soon discover, is not really possible. True, we can switch from one reading to another with increasing rapidity; we will also "remember" the rabbit while we see the duck, but the more closely we watch ourselves, the more certainly we will discover that we cannot experience alternative readings at the same time. Illusion, we will find, is hard to describe or analyze, for though we may be intellectually aware of the fact

6

INTRODUCTION

that any given experience must be an illusion, we cannot, strictly speak-
ing, watch ourselves having an illusion. If the reader finds this assertion a little puzzling, there is always an
instrument of illusion close at hand to verify it: the bathroom mirror. I specify the bathroom because the experiment I urge the reader to make
succeeds best if the mirror is a little clouded by steam. It is a fascinating
exercise in illusionist representation to trace one's own head on the sur-
face of the mirror and to clear the area enclosed by the outline. For only
when we have actually done this do we realize how small the image is which gives us the illusion of seeing ourselves "face to face." To be exact, it must be precisely half the size of our head. I do not want to trouble
the reader with geometrical proof of this fact, though basically it is sim-
pie : since the mirror will always appear to be halfway between me and
,
my reflection, the size on its surface will be one half of the apparent size.
But however cogently this fact can be demonstrated with the help of similar triangles, the assertion is usually met with frank incredulity.
And despite all geometry, I, too, would stubbornly contend that I really
see my head (natural size) when I shave and that the size on the mirror surface is the phantom. I cannot have my cake and eat it. I cannot make
use of an illusion and watch it. Works of art are not mirrors, but they share with mirrors that elusive
magic of transformation which is so hard to put into words. A master of
introspection, Kenneth Clark, has recently described to us most vividly
how even he was defeated when he attempted to "stalk" an illusion. Looking at a great Velazquez, he wanted to observe what went on when the
brush strokes and dabs of pigment on the canvas transformed themselves into a vision of transfigured reality as he stepped back. But try as he might, stepping backward and forward, he could never hold both
visions at the same time, and therefore the answer to his problem of how it was done always seemed to elude him. In Kenneth Clark's example,
the issues of aesthetics and of psychology are subtly intertwined; in the examples of the psychology textbooks, they are obviously not. In this book I have often found it convenient to isolate the discussion of visual effects
from the discussion of works of art. I realize this may sometimes lead to
an impression of irreverence; I hope the opposite is the truth. Representation need not be art, but it is none the less mysterious for

Psychology and the Riddle of Style

that. I well remember that the power and magic of image making was first revealed to me, not by Velazquez, but by a simple drawing game
I found in my primer. A little rhyme explained how you could first draw a circle to represent a loaf of bread (for loaves were round in my native
Vienna); a curve added on top would turn the loaf into a shopping bag;
two little squiggles on its handle would make it shrink into a purse; and now by adding a tail, here was a cat [3]. What intrigued me, as I learned

3 How to draw a cat
the trick, was the power of metamorphosis: the tail destroyed the purse and created the cat; you cannot see the one without obliterating the other. Far as we are from completely understanding this process, how can we hope to approach Velazquez?
I had hardly anticipated, when I embarked on my explorations, into
what distant fields the subject of illusion would take me. I can only ap-
peal to the reader who wishes to join in this Hunting of the Snark to train himself a little in the game of self-observation, not so much in museums as in his daily commerce with pictures and images of all kinds— while sitting on the bus or standing in the waiting room. What he will see there
will obviously not count as art. It will be less pretentious but also less embarrassing than poor works of art that ape the tricks of Velazquez.
When we deal with masters of the past who were both great artists
and great "illusionists," the study of art and the study of illusion cannot
always be kept apart. I am all the more anxious to emphasize as ex-
plicitly as I possibly can that this book is not intended as a plea, disguised or otherwise, for the exercise of illusionist tricks in painting today. I should like to prevent this particular breakdown of communication be-
tween myself and my readers and critics because I am, in fact, rather
critical of certain theories of nonfigurative art and have alluded to some

8

INTRODUCTION

of these issues where they seemed relevant. But to chase this hare would

be to miss the point of the book. That the discoveries and effects of rep-

resentation which were the pride of earlier artists have become trivial

today I would not deny for a moment. Yet I believe that we are in real

danger of losing contact with the great masters of the past if we accept

the fashionable doctrine that such matters never had anything to do with

art. The very reason why the representation of nature can now be looked

upon as something commonplace should be of the greatest interest to the

historian. Never before has there been an age like ours when the visual
image was so cheap in every sense of the word. We are surrounded and

assailed by posters and advertisements, by comics and magazine illustra-

We tions.

see aspects of reality represented on the television screen and

in the movies, on postage stamps and on food packages. Painting is taught

at school and practiced at home as therapy and as a pastime, and many

a modest amateur has mastered tricks that would have looked like sheer

magic to Giotto. Perhaps even the crude colored renderings we find on a

box of breakfast cereal would have made Giotto's contemporaries gasp.

I do not know if there are people who conclude from this that the box is

superior to a Giotto. I am not one of them. But I think that the victory

and vulgarization of representational skills create a problem for both the

historian and the critic.

The Greeks said that to marvel is the beginning of knowledge and

where we cease to marvel we may be in danger of ceasing to know. The

main aim I have set myself in these chapters is to restore our sense of

wonder at man's capacity to conjure up by forms, lines, shades, or colors

those mysterious phantoms of visual reality we call "pictures." "Should

we not say," said Plato in the Sophist, "that we make a house by the art

of building, and by the art of painting we make another house, a sort of

man-made dream produced for those who are awake?" I know of no better

description to teach us the art of wonder again — and it detracts nothing

from Plato's definition that many of these man-made dreams, pro-

duced for those who are awake, are banished by us from the realm of art,

perhaps rightly, because they are almost too effective as dream substitutes,

whether we call them pin-ups or comics. Even pin-ups and comics, rightly

viewed, may provide food for thought. Just as the study of poetry remains

incomplete without an awareness of the language of prose, so, I believe,

the study of art will be increasingly supplemented by inquiry into the lin-

guistics of the visual image. Already we see the outlines of iconology, which

investigates the function of images in allegory and symbolism and their

reference to what might be called the "invisible world of ideas." The way the

language of art refers to the visible world is both so obvious and so myste-

rious that it is still largely unknown except to the artists themselves who

can use it as we use all languages -without needing to know its grammar

and semantics.

A great deal of practical knowledge is stored in the many books written

by artists and art teachers for the use of students and amateurs. Not

being an artist myself, I have refrained from enlarging on such technical
matters beyond the needs of my argument. But I should be happy if each

chapter of this book could be seen as a provisional pier for the much-

needed bridge between the field of art history and the domain of the

Ill
the reader who likes to be plunged in medias res is advised to turn
from here to the first chapter. There is a good old tradition, however (as good and as old, in fact, as Plato and Aristotle), which demands that those
who tackle a philosophical problem and propose a new solution should
first give a critical account of its history. In the next three sections of this Introduction, therefore, I shall briefly survey the growth of our ideas about
style and explain how the history of representation in art became increasingly mixed up with the psychology of perception. The final section will be
devoted to the present situation and to the program of this book. The word "style," of course, is derived from "stilus," the writing instru-
ment of the Romans, who would speak of an "accomplished style" much
as later generations spoke of a "fluent pen." Classical education was centered on the student's power of expression and persuasion, and thus a great deal of thought was given by the ancient teachers of rhetoric to all aspects of style in speech and writing. Their discussions provided a storehouse of ideas on art and expression that had a lasting influence on criti-

INTRODUCTION

cism. Most of these efforts were concerned with analyzing the psychological effects of various stylistic devices and traditions and the development of a rich terminology to describe the "categories of expression," the ornate and the humble, the sublime and the bombastic. But characters of this
kind are notoriously hard to describe, except in metaphors: we speak of
a "scintillating" or a "woolly" style. Without this need, the terminology of style might never have spread to the visual arts. Casting around for vivid methods of characterization, the ancient writers on rhetoric liked to bring in comparisons with painting and sculpture. Quintilian, in par-
ticular, inserts a brief history of art from the "hard" manner of archaic sculpture to the "softness" and "sweetness" of fourth-century masters to illustrate the rise of Latin oratory and its change in character from rough vigor to smooth polish. Fascinating as these discussions are, they frequently suffer from a confusion which we have inherited. The problems of expressive modes are rarely disentangled from that of varying skills. Thus what looks like progress from the point of view of the mastery of a medium can also be viewed as decline into empty virtuosity. Polemics between the various schools of rhetoric make ample use of such moral arguments. Asiatic bombast is decried as a sign of moral decay, and the return
to a pure Attic vocabulary is hailed as a moral victory. There exists an essay by Seneca in which the corruption of style at the hands of Maecenas is mercilessly analyzed as a manifestation of a corrupt society in which affectation and obscurity count for more than straightforward lucidity. But arguments of this kind did not remain unanswered. Tacitus, in his
dialogue on oratory, presents a case against the Jeremiahs of his time who
decried contemporary styles. Times have changed and so have our ears.
We demand a different style of oratory. This reference to the conditions of
the time and the diversity of "ears" is perhaps the first fleeting contact between the psychology of style and that of perception. I know of no such explicit reference in ancient writings on art. Not that the bearing of the painter's skill on the psychology of perception was lost on antiquity. In one of Cicero's philosophical dialogues, the Academica, the argument turns on the status of sense perceptions as a source of knowledge. The
skeptic who denies the possibility of any knowledge is reminded of the acuteness and perfectibility of our eyes: "How much painters see in shade and protrusions that we do not see!" exclaims the speaker, only to

:

n

be reminded later that this argument merely proves how feeble the vision of an ordinary Roman must be, for how many painters are Romans?
There is no evidence, however, that classical antiquity fully realized
the implications of this observation. Strictly speaking, it poses a question
which is still unsolved. Are painters successful in the imitation of reality because they "see more," or do they see more because they have acquired
the skill of imitation? Both views are somehow supported by commonsense experience. Artists know that they learn by looking intensely at na-
ture, but obviously looking alone has never sufficed to teach an artist his trade. In antiquity the conquest of illusion by art was such a recent achievement that the discussion of painting and sculpture inevitably
centered on imitation, mimesis. Indeed it may be said that the progress
of art toward that goal was to the ancient world what the progress of technics is to the modern: the model of progress as such. Thus Pliny told the history of sculpture and painting as the history of inventions, assigning definite achievements in the rendering of nature to individual artists the painter Polygnotus was the first to represent people with open mouths and with teeth, the sculptor Pythagoras was the first to render nerves and veins, the painter Nicias was concerned with light and shade. In the Renaissance it was Vasari who applied this technique to the history of the arts of Italy from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century. Vasari never
fails to pay tribute to those artists of the past who made a distinct contribution, as he saw it, to the mastery of representation. "Art rose from humble beginnings to the summit of perfection" because such natural geniuses
as Giotto blazed the trail and others were thus enabled to build on their
achievements. Thus we read of the mysterious Stefano: "Although the foreshortenings which he made are faulty in manner . . . owing to the
difficulty of execution, yet, as the first investigator of these difficulties, he
deserves much greater fame than do those who follow after him with a
more orderly and regulated style." Vasari, in other words, saw the invention of the means of representation as a great collective enterprise of such difficulty that a certain division of labor was inevitable. Thus he says of Taddeo Gaddi: "Taddeo always adopted Giotto's manner but did not greatly improve it except in the coloring, which he made fresher and more
vivid. Giotto had paid so much attention to the improvement of other as-
pects and difficulties of this art that although he was adequate in coloring,

12

INTRODUCTION

he was not more than that. Hence Taddeo, who had seen and learned what Giotto had made easy, had time to add something of his own by im-
proving coloring."
I hope to show in the course of this book that this view is by no means as naive as it is sometimes made out to be. It appears naive only because Vasari, too, could not disentangle the idea of invention from that of the imitation of nature. This contradiction nearly comes to the surface in
Vasari's treatment of Masaccio, whom he credits with the discovery that
"painting is nothing more than the simple portrayal of all things alive in nature by means of design and color as nature herself produces them." Masaccio, for instance, "loved to paint drapery with few folds and an easy fall just as they are in natural life, and this has been of great use to artists, so that he deserves to be commended as if he had invented it."
It is at such moments the reader will ask himself what difficulty
there could have been in this simple portrayal which prevented artists before Masaccio from looking at the fall of drapery for themselves. It took some time for this question to emerge in an articulate form, but its formulation and the first attempts to answer it are still bound up with the academic tradition of art teaching.
The question of what is involved in "looking at nature"— what we
today call the psychology of perception— first entered into the discus-
sion of style as a practical problem in art teaching. The academic teacher bent on accuracy of representation found, as he still will find, that his pupils' difficulties were due not only to an inability to copy nature but also to an inability to see it. Discussing this observation, Jonathan
Richardson remarked, early in the eighteenth century: "For it is a cer-
tain maxim, no man sees what things are, that knows not what they ought to be. That this maxim is true, will appear by an academy figure
drawn by one ignorant in the structure, and knitting of the bones, and anatomy, compared with another who understands these thoroughly . . . both see the same life, but with different eyes."
It was but a step from such observations to the idea that the changes in style such as Vasari had described were not only based on an improvement of skill but were the result of different modes of seeing the world. This step had already been taken in the eighteenth century and, appropriately, by an academic teacher, James Barry, in one of the lectures de-

t^vl

livered at the Royal Academy. Barry was puzzled by Vasari's story that Cimabue's Madonna Rucellai [4] (now generally attributed to Duccio) was acclaimed as a masterpiece in the thirteenth century. "The very great deficiencies of this work of Cimabue," Barry said, "might, perhaps, induce some to think that he could not possibly have availed himself of the inspection of nature when he painted it. But the imitations of early
art are exactly like those of children; nothing is seen even in the spectacle
before us, until it be in some measure otherwise previously known and
sought for, and numberless observable differences between the ages

INTRODUCTION

of ignorance and those of knowledge show how much the contraction
or extension of our sphere of vision depends upon other considerations than the simple return of our mere natural optics. The people, then, of those ages only saw so much, and admired it, because they knew no
more."
Stimulated by the rise of science and the new interest in factual observation, these questions of vision were much debated by artists at the
start of the nineteenth century. "The art of seeing nature," said Constable
in his pungent way, "is a thing almost as much to be acquired as the art of reading the Egyptian hieroglyphs." There is a new edge to this utterance,
for this time it is addressed to the public rather than to artists. The public has no right to judge the veracity of a painting, Constable implies, because its vision is clouded by ignorance and prejudice. It was this same conviction that led Ruskin, in 1843, to publish his Modern Painters in defense of Turner. This vast treatise is perhaps the last and most persuasive book in the tradition that starts with Pliny and Vasari in which the history of art is interpreted as progress toward visual truth. Turner is better than Claude or Canaletto, Ruskin argues, because he knows demonstrably more about
natural effects than his predecessors. But this "truth of nature is not to be discerned by the uneducated senses." Let the doubting critic analyze the structure of waves and clouds, of rocks and vegetation, and he will have
to admit that Turner is correct every time. The progress of art here becomes a triumph over the prejudices of tradition. It is slow because it is so hard for us all to disentangle what we really see from what we merely know and thus to recover the innocent eye, a term to which Ruskin gave cur-
rency.
Without being aware of the fact, Ruskin had thus laid the explosive charge which was to blow the academic edifice sky-high. For Barry "the simple return of our natural optics" had appeared insufficient to produce
anything better than the Madonna Rucellai. For Ruskin and those who followed him, the painter's aim was to be to return to the unadulterated truth of natural optics. The discoveries of the impressionists and the
heated debates which they aroused increased the interest of artists and
critics in these mysteries of perception. Had the impressionists really the right to claim that they saw the world as they painted it, that they reproduced "the image on the retina"? Was that the goal toward which

15

the whole history of art had been moving? Would the psychology of per-
ception finally solve the artist's problems?

IV
this debate revealed what is was bound to reveal: science is neutral, and the artist will appeal to its findings at his peril. The distinction between what we really see and what we infer through the intellect is as
old as human thought on perception. Pliny had succinctly summed up the position in classical antiquity when he wrote that "the mind is the
real instrument of sight and observation, the eyes act as a sort of vessel receiving and transmitting the visible portion of the consciousness." Ptol-
emy devotes much thought in his Optics (c. a.d. 150) to the role of judgment in the process of vision. The greatest Arab student of the subject,
Alhazen (d. a.d. 1038), taught the medieval West the distinction between sense, knowledge, and inference, all of which come into play in perception. "Nothing visible is understood by the sense of sight alone," he says, "save light and colors." The problem raised by this tradition acquired fresh urgency when John Locke came to deny all innate ideas and insisted that all knowledge comes to us through the senses. For if the eye reacts only to light and color, where does our knowledge of the third dimension
come from? It was Berkeley who, in his New Theory of Vision ( 1709 ), ex-
plored the ground afresh and reached the conclusion that all our knowledge of space and solidity must be acquired through the sense of touch and movement. This analysis into "sense data," begun by the British empiricists, continued to dominate psychological research in the nineteenth century when intellectual giants such as Helmholtz developed the science
of physiological optics. But neither Berkeley nor Helmholtz made the mistake of confusing "seeing" with the visual sensation. On the contrary, the distinction between what came to be known as "sensation" — the mere
registering of "stimuli"— and the mental act of perception based, as Helmholtz put it, on "unconscious inference" was a commonplace of nine-
teenth-century psychology.
It was thus not difficult to counter the psychological arguments of the impressionists that their paintings showed the world "as we really see it" with equally valid psychological arguments for the reliance of tradi-

tional art on intellectual knowledge. In the course of this debate, which began toward the end of the nineteenth century, the whole comfortable idea of the imitation of nature disintegrated, leaving artists and critics per-
plexed.
Two German thinkers are prominent in this story. One is the critic Konrad Fiedler, who insisted, in opposition to the impressionists, that
"even the simplest sense impression that looks like merely the raw material for the operations of the mind is already a mental fact, and what we call the external world is really the result of a complex psychological
process."
But it was Fiedler's friend, the neoclassical sculptor Adolf von Hildebrand, who set out to analyze this process in a little book called The Problem of Form in the Figurative Arts, which came out in 1893 and gained the ear of a whole generation. Hildebrand, too, challenged the ideals of scientific naturalism by an appeal to the psychology of perception : if we attempt to analyze our mental images to discover their primary constituents, we will find them composed of sense data derived from
vision and from memories of touch and movement. A sphere, for in-
stance, appears to the eye as a flat disk; it is touch which informs us of the properties of space and form. Any attempt on the part of the artist to eliminate this knowledge is futile, for without it he would not perceive the world at all. His task is, on the contrary, to compensate for the absence of movement in his work by clarifying his image and thus conveying not only visual sensations but also those memories of touch which enable us to reconstitute the three-dimensional form in our minds.
It is hardly an accident that the period when these ideas were so eagerly debated was also the period when the history of art emancipated
itself from antiquarianism, biography, and aesthetics. Issues which had been taken for granted so long suddenly looked problematic and required
reassessment. When Bernard Berenson wrote his brilliant essay on the
Florentine painters, which came out in 1896, he formulated his aesthetic creed in terms of Hildebrand's analysis. With his gift for the pregnant phrase, he summed up almost the whole of the sculptor's somewhat turgid
book in the sentence "The painter can accomplish his task only by giving tactile values to retinal impressions." For Berenson, Giotto's or Pollaiuolo's claim on our attention is that they had done precisely this. Like

Hildebrand, he was concerned with aesthetics rather than with history. Three years later, in 1899, Heinrich Wolfflin paid tribute to Hilde-
brand in the preface to his classic book on Classic Art. The ideal of clarity and spatial order presented by Wolfflin in his descriptions of Raphael's masterpieces shows the marks of Hildebrand's influence no less vividly than does Berenson's image of Giotto. But Wolfflin saw that Hildebrand's categories were suitable not only as an aid to appreciation but also as a tool for the analysis of various modes of representation. The final "polarities" he was to evolve in his Principles of Art History, the distinction between the solid clarity of Renaissance modes and the "painterly" complexities of the Baroque, still owe much to Hildebrand's approach. It was Wolfflin who gave currency to the catchword of the "history of seeing" in art history, but it was also he who warned against taking this metaphor too seriously. Wolfflin, in fact, never mistook description for explanation. Few historians were more acutely aware than he of the problem posed by the very existence of representational styles, but with that restraint which he had inherited from his great predecessor Jakob Burckhardt, he never
entered into speculations about the ultimate causes of historical change.
It was thus left to the third of the founding fathers of stylistic history, Alois Riegl, to marry Hildebrand's ideas to the study of artistic evolution. Riegl's ambition was to make the history of art scientifically respectable by eliminating all subjective ideals of value. He was favored in this
approach by his work in a museum of arts and crafts. Studying the history
of decorative art, of pattern and ornament, he had become convinced of the inadequacy of those assumptions which had dominated the scene — the "materialist" assumption that pattern depended on such techniques as weaving and basketry and the technological assumption that what
counts in art is skill of hand. After all, the decorative patterns of many so-called "primitive tribes" testify to an amazing manual dexterity. If
styles have differed it must be because intentions have changed. In his first book, the Stilfragen of 1893, Riegl showed that questions of this kind could and should be discussed in a purely "objective" manner without introducing subjective ideas of progress and decline. He sought to demonstrate that plant ornament evolves and changes in one continuous tradition, from the Egyptian lotus to the arabesque, and that these changes, far from being fortuitous, express a general reorientation of

l8

INTRODUCTION

artistic intentions, of the "will-to- form" which manifests itself in the smallest palmette no less than in the most monumental building. To this approach, the notion of a "decline" was meaningless. The historian's task is not to judge but to explain.
It so happens that another art historian in Vienna, the great Franz Wickhoff, was also bent, at the same time, on clearing a period of the stigma of decline. In 1895 he was publishing the Vienna Genesis, a precious manuscript of late antiquity, and he wanted to demonstrate that what
had been considered the debased and slovenly style of Roman imperial
art deserved such an accusation as little as did the modern impressionists, whose much-maligned paintings Wickhoff had learned to love. The art of the Romans, Wickhoff concluded, was as progressive in the direction of visual subjectivity as the art of his own time.
Riegl seized on this interpretation as the basis for an even bolder generalization. In 1901 he defined his position toward Hildebrand's muchdiscussed theories: The historian could accept Hildebrand's psychological analysis; he could not share his artistic bias. Reliance on touch was neither better nor worse than reliance on vision; each was justified in its
own right and in its own period. Having been commissioned to publish
archaeological finds from the period of declining antiquity, Riegl wrote
his famous book Spatromische Kunstindustrie ("Late Roman Arts and Crafts"), which represents the most ambitious attempt ever made to
interpret the whole course of art history in terms of changing modes of
perception.
The book is hard to read and even harder to summarize, but Riegl's main argument is that ancient art was always concerned with the render-
ing of individual objects rather than with the infinite world as such. Egyptian art shows this attitude in its extreme form, for here vision is only allowed a very subsidiary part; things are rendered as they appear to the
sense of touch, the more "objective" sense which reports on the permanent
shape of things irrespective of the shifting viewpoint. Here, too, is the rea-
son why Egyptians shunned the rendering of the third dimension, be-
cause recession and foreshortening would have introduced a subjective
element. An advance toward the third dimension, which grants the eye its share in the perception of modeling, was made in Greece. It needed,
however, the third and last phase of ancient art -late antiquity -to

Psychology and the Riddle of Style

19

develop a purely visual mode of rendering objects as they appear from a distance. But paradoxically this advance strikes the modern observer as a regression because it makes bodies look flat and shapeless, and since only
individual things are rendered, irrespective of their surroundings, these
lumpy figures look doubly harsh as they stand out against an indefinite foil of shadowy depth or golden ground. Within the context of world history, however, late antique art was not a decline but a necessary phase of transi-
tion. The intervention of Germanic tribes, whom Riegl considered more
inclined to subjectivity, enabled art to continue its transformations on a higher plane, from a tactile conception of three-dimensional space as conceived in the Renaissance to a further increase in visual subjectivity in the Baroque and so to the triumph of pure optical sensations in impressionism: "Every style aims at a faithful rendering of nature and
nothing else, but each has its own conception of Nature. . . ."
There is a touch of genius in the single-mindedness with which Riegl tries by one unitary principle to account for all stylistic changes in architecture, sculpture, painting, and patternmaking. But this single-minded-
ness, which he took to be the hallmark of a scientific approach, made him a prey to those prescientific habits of mind by which unitary principles proliferate, the habits of the mythmakers. The "will-to-form," the
Kunstwollen, becomes a ghost in the machine, driving the wheels of artistic developments according to "inexorable laws." In fact, as Meyer Schapiro has pointed out, Riegl's "motivation of the process and his explanation of its shifts in time and space are vague and often fantastic. Each great phase corresponds to a racial disposition. . . . Each race
plays a prescribed role and retires when its part is done. . . ."
It is not difficult to see in this picture of world history a revival of those romantic mythologies which found their climax in Hegel's philos-
ophy of history. To classical antiquity and to the Renaissance, the history of art had reflected the increase in technical skill. In this context the arts themselves were sometimes spoken of as having a childhood, maturity, and decline. But the romantics saw the whole of history as the great drama of mankind's evolution from childhood to maturity. Art became the "expression of the age" and a symptom of the phase which the World Spirit had reached at any given point. In the context of such speculations, the German romantic physician Carl Gustav Carus had

20

INTRODUCTION

actually anticipated Riegl in his interpretation of the history of art as a
movement from touch to vision. Wanting to plead for the recognition of
landscape painting as the great art of the future, he based his advocacy on the laws of historical inevitability: "The development of the senses in
any organism begins with feeling, with touch. The more subtle senses of hearing and seeing emerge only when the organism perfects itself. In
almost the same manner, mankind began with sculpture. What man formed had to be massive, solid, tangible. This is the reason why paint-
ing . . . always belongs to a later phase. . . . Landscape art . . . presupposes a higher degree of development."
I have discussed elsewhere why this reliance of art history on mytho-
logical explanations seems so dangerous to me. By inculcating the habit of talking in terms of collectives, of "mankind," "races," or "ages," it 'weakens resistance to totalitarian habits of mind. I do not make these accusations lightly. Indeed I can quote chapter and verse by enumerating the lessons which Hans Sedlmayr wanted the reader to draw from reading Riegl's collected essays, the introduction to which he wrote in 1927.
Having presented what he considered the "quintessence" of Riegl's doctrine, Sedlmayr proceeded to enumerate the false intellectual positions which those who embrace Riegl's views of history must give up as
untenable. Among the convictions we are asked to surrender is the idea that "only individual human beings are real, while groups and spiritual collectives are mere names." It follows for Sedlmayr that we must also "reject the belief in the unity and immutability of human nature and human reason" no less than the idea that "nature remains the same and is only 'represented' in different modes." Finally, we must renounce the
causal analysis of history "which conceives of historical change merely as a resultant of blind and isolated chains of causation." There is such a thing as the "meaningful self-movement of the Spirit which results in genuine historical totalities of events."
I happen to be a passionate believer in all those outmoded ideas which Sedlmayr in 1927 asked a gullible public to discard in favor of a Spenglerian historicism. Like K. R. Popper, on whose words in The Poverty of Historicisiii I cannot improve, "I have not the slightest sympathy with these 'spirits'; neither with their idealistic prototype nor with their dia-
lectical and materialistic incarnations, and I am in full sympathy with

Psychology and the Riddle of Style

21

those who treat them with contempt. And yet I feel that they indicate,
at least, the existence of a vacuum, of a place which it is the task of sociology to fill with something more sensible, such as an analysis of problems arising within a tradition." Styles, I believe, are instances of
such traditions. As long as we have no better hypothesis to offer, the existence of uniform modes of representing the world must invite the facile explanation that such a unity must be due to some supraindividual
spirit, the "spirit of the age" or the "spirit of the race."
Not that I deny that historians, like other students of groups, often
find attitudes, beliefs, or tastes that are shared by many and might well
be described as the mentality or outlook dominant in a class, generation, or nation. Nor do I doubt that changes in the intellectual climate and changes in fashion or taste are often symptomatic of social change, or that an investigation of these connections can be worth while. Both in the writings of Riegl himself and in those of his followers and interpreters, such as Worringer, Dvorak, and Sedlmayr, there is a wealth of challenging historical problems and suggestions, but I would assert that what is their greatest pride is in fact their fatal flaw: by throwing out the idea
of skill they have not only surrendered vital evidence, they have made it
impossible to realize their ambition, a valid psychology of stylistic change.
The history of taste and fashion is the history of preferences, of various acts of choice between given alternatives. The rejection by the PreRaphaelites of the academic conventions of their day is an example, and so is the Japonism of art nouvean. Such changes in style and in the prestige of styles might be described (though hardly exhaustively) in terms of a "will-to-form"; no one doubts they were symptomatic of a whole cluster of attitudes. But what matters here from the point of view of method is that an act of choice is only of symptomatic significance, is expressive of something only if we can reconstruct the choice situation. The captain on the bridge who could have left the sinking ship but
stayed must have been a hero; the man who was trapped in his sleep and drowned may also have been heroic, but we shall never know. If we
really want to treat styles as symptomatic of something else (which may, on occasion, be very interesting), we cannot do without some theory of alternatives. If every change is inevitable and total, there is nothing left to compare, no situation to reconstruct, no symptom or expression to be

investigated. Change becomes the symptom of change as such, and to hide this tautology, some grandiose scheme of evolution has to be called in, as happened not only to Riegl but to many of his successors. There are few historians today, and even fewer anthropologists, who believe that mankind has undergone any marked biological change within historical periods. But even those who might admit the possibility of some slight oscillation in the genetic make-up of mankind would never accept
the idea that man has changed as much within the last three thousand
years, a mere hundred generations, as have his art and his style.

evolutionism is dead, but the facts which gave rise to its myth are still stubbornly there to be accounted for. One of these facts is a certain kinship between child art and primitive art that had suggested to the unwary the false alternatives that either these primitives could not do better because they were as unskilled as children or that they did not want to do anything else because they still had the mentality of children. Both these conclusions are obviously false. They are due to the tacit assumption that
what is easy for us must always have been easy. It seems to me one of
the permanent gains of the first contacts between art history and the
psychology of perception that we need no longer believe this. Indeed,
though I regret the misuse of this psychology in its historicist form, I admit to a certain nostalgia for the speculative boldness of those nineteenth-century optimists. Perhaps this is due to the fact that I still had the privilege of being taught by such bold minds who, at the turn of this
century, tried to tackle the problem of why art has a history. One of them was Emanuel Loewy, whose famous study The Rendering of Nature in Early Greek Art came out in 1900. That book, it seems to me, contains
most of what is worth preserving in evolutionism. Loewy, too, was influenced by Hildebrand and by the outlook of
sense-data psychology. Like other critics of his period, Hildebrand had
attributed the peculiarities of child art to a reliance on vague memory images. These images were conceived of as the residue of many sense impressions that had been deposited in the memory and there coalesced into typical shapes, much in the way typical images can be created by

Psychology and the Riddle of Style

23

the superimposition of many photographs. In this process, Loewy thought,

the memory sifted out the characteristic features of objects, those aspects

which show them in their most distinctive form. The primitive artist, like

the child, takes these memory images as his starting point. He will tend to represent the human body frontally, horses in profile, and lizards from

above. Loewy's analysis of these "archaic" modes is still basically accepted,

though his explanation is really circular: since the primitive artist ob-

viously does not copy the outside world, he is believed to copy some in-

visible inside world of mental images. For these mental images, in their

turn, however, the typical pictures of primitives are the only evidence.

None of us, I believe, carries in his head such schematic pictures of

bodies, horses, or lizards as Loewy's theory postulates. What these words

conjure up will be different for all of us, but it will always be an elusive

welter of fleeting events which can never be communicated in full. But

this criticism cannot detract from the value of Loewy's analysis of those

features which the works of children, untutored adults, and primitives

have in common. By taking as his subject not the evolution of mankind

but the first occasion in history when these features were slowly and

methodically eliminated in early Greek art, Loewy taught us to appreciate

the forces which have to be overcome by an art aiming at the illusion of

reality. Each of these steps appears as a conquest of hitherto unknown

territory that had to be secured and fortified in a new tradition of image

making. Thus arises the tenacity of the newly invented types that no

theory of art in terms of "sense impressions" was able to account for.

my It so happens that

teacher in the history of art, Julius von

Schlosser, was also particularly interested in the role of the type and even

of the stereotype in tradition. His starting point had been in numismatics,

and he soon found his way to the study of medieval art, where the sway

of the formula is so marked. The problem of the use of "precedents" or

"similes" in medieval art never ceased to fascinate Schlosser despite the

fact that the influence of Croce made him increasingly suspicious of

psychological explanations. Those who know his meditations on these

problems will recognize some of their recurrent themes in this book.

What Schlosser did for the Middle Ages, his contemporary Aby

Warburg did for the Italian Renaissance. In pursuing the problem that

governed his life, the problem of what exactly it was that the Renaissance

24

INTRODUCTION

sought in classical antiquity, Warburg was led to investigate the rise of

Renaissance styles in terms of the adoption of a new visual language.

He saw that the borrowings of Renaissance artists from classical sculpture

were not haphazard. They occurred whenever a painter felt in need of a

particularly expressive image of movement or gesture, of what Warburg

came to call Pathosformel. His insistence that quattrocento artists, who

had previously been regarded as the champions of pure observation, so

frequently took recourse to a borrowed formula made a great impression.

Aided by interest in iconographic types, his followers found increasingly

that dependence on tradition is the rule even with works of art of the

Renaissance and the Baroque that had hitherto been regarded as nat-
uralistic. Investigations of these continuities have now largely replaced

the older preoccupation with style.

It was Andre Malraux who seized upon the significance of these

findings in his captivating volumes on The Psychology of Art. There is
much of Hegel and Spengler in Malraux's rhapsodic hymns to myth and

to change, but he has at last disposed of the misunderstanding which

comes in for its share of ridicule in Alain's cartoon, the idea that the

styles of the past literally reflect the way these artists "saw" the world.

Malraux knows that art is born of art, not of nature. Yet, for all its fascina-

tion and its brilliant psychological asides, Malraux's book fails to give us

We what its title promises, a psychology of art.

still have no satisfactory

explanation for the puzzle of Alain's cartoon. But we may be better pre-

pared than Riegl was to attempt such an explanation. We have learned

a good deal about the grip of conventions and the power of traditions in

more fields than one. Historians have investigated the hold which the

formula has over the chronicler who means to record recent events;

students of literature, such as Ernst Robert Curtius, have demonstrated

the role of the "topos," the traditional commonplace, in the warp and

woof of poetry. The time seems ripe to approach the problem of style

once more, fortified by this knowledge of the force of traditions.

I realize that this insistence on the tenacity of conventions, on the

role of types and stereotypes in art, will be met with skepticism by those

who have not worked in this field. It has almost become the stock accusa-

tion against art history that it concentrates on a search for influences

and thereby misses the mystery of creativity. But this is not necessarily

25

the case. The more we become aware of the enormous pull in man to
repeat what he has learned, the greater will be our admiration for those
exceptional beings who could break this spell and make a significant
advance on which others could build.
Even so, I have sometimes asked myself whether my assumptions are
really borne out by the facts of art history, whether the need for a formula is as universal as I postulated it to be. I remembered a beautiful passage
from Quintilian where he speaks of the creativity of the human mind
and uses the artist as an illustration:
"Not everything that art can achieve can be passed on. What painter
ever learned to represent everything that exists in nature? But once he has grasped the principles of imitation, he will portray whatever presents
itself. Which craftsman has not made a vessel of a shape he has never
seen?" It is an important reminder, but it does not account for the fact that
even the shape of the new vessel will somehow belong to the same family
of forms as those the craftsman has seen, that his representation of "everything that exists in nature" will still be linked with those representa-
tions that were handed on to him by his teachers. It is once more the stubborn fact of Alain's Egyptian boys that has to be accounted for, and no historian of art will be inclined to underrate the sway of style, least of all the historian who maps the long road to illusion.

to tackle these central problems of our discipline, I believe, it cannot be

sufficient to repeat the old opposition between "seeing" and "knowing,"

or to insist in a general way that all representation is based on conven-

We tions.

have to get down to analyzing afresh, in psychological terms,

what is actually involved in the process of image making and image

reading. But here a formidable obstacle arises. The simple type of psy-

chology on which Barry and Ruskin, Riegl and Loewy relied with such

confidence no longer exists to guide us. Psychology has become alive to

the immense complexity of the processes of perception, and no one claims

to understand them completely.

Bernard Berenson could introduce his excursion into these fields with

26

INTRODUCTION

the words "psychology has ascertained. . . ." Those who consult more recent books will not find the same tone of assured authority. J. J. Gibson, for instance, writes in his exciting study The Perception of the Visual
World, "Learning to attend to novel features of the world, to explore it,
is something which psychologists do not understand at present" — and down go the hopes of the historian. D. O. Hebb in his well-known book The Organization of Behavior even tells us that "the perception of size, brightness and pitch should be written down for the present as not yet accounted for by any theory." Nor is this perplexity confined to basic questions. Discussing the so-called "spreading effect," the unexpected way superimposed colors may affect each other, which is so important for the painter, Ralph M. Evans in his basic Introduction to Color says: "The
writer feels that until this effect can be explained without elaborate
assumptions we cannot say that we understand the way in which the
visual process operates."
In these circumstances it may seem foolhardy to invoke the results of one field of uncertain study for the explanation of our own uncertainties.
Yet, encouragement for this kind of venture comes precisely from one of the greatest pioneers in the field of perceptual psychology, Wolfgang Kohler. In his lectures on Dynamics in Psychology (1940), Kohler extols
the virtues of "trespassing as a scientific technique":
"The most fortunate moments in the history of knowledge occur when facts which have been as yet no more than special data are suddenly referred to other apparently distant facts, and thus appear in a new light. For this to happen in psychology we should keep ourselves informed about more than our subject-matter in the narrowest sense." And Kohler
asks : "If the present situation of psychology offers us an excellent reason -or should I say a marvellous pretext— for extending our curiosity be-
yond our limited field, should we not rather be impatient to seize this
opportunity at once?" At least one of Kohler's followers has seized the opportunity and has
ventured from psychology into the field of art. Rudolf Arnheim's book Art and Visual Perception deals with the visual image from the point of
view of Gestalt psychology. I have read it with much profit. His chapter on growth, which deals with child art, seems to me so instructive that I
was relieved to be able to exclude this much-discussed example from the
field of my inquiry. For the historian and his problems of style, on the

Psychology and the Riddle of Style

27

other hand, the book yields less. Perhaps its author is too eager to follow Riegl in his "objectivity," too eager also to vindicate the experiments of twentieth-century art to see the problem of illusion as anything but a
Philistine prejudice. The fact that different periods are known to have had different standards of "lifelikeness" makes him hope that a "further shift of the artistic reality level" will make works of Picasso, Braque, or
Klee "look exactly like the things they represent." If he is right, the Sears Roebuck catalogue of the year 2000 will represent the mandolins, jugs,
or twittering machines for sale on this new reality level. The book by W. M. Ivins, Jr., Prints and Visual Communication, is
an astringent antidote to these intellectual fashions. For Ivins has shown that the history of representation can indeed be treated in the context
of the history of science without reference to aesthetic issues. It is in this context that I should also like to mention Anton Ehren-
zweig's book The Psychoanalysis of Artistic Vision and Hearing. The speculative boldness with which the author tries to fit the findings of Gestalt psychology into a system of Freudian ideas deserves attention and respect. Ehrenzweig certainly does not make the mistake of underrating those forces that have to be overcome by scientific naturalism in art. He
gives us challenging descriptions of the visual chaos that art seeks to dominate, but he, too, I believe, mars his analysis by a refusal to discuss objective reality tests and by a flight into evolutionist speculations.
The three books I have mentioned prove what we all know, that
certain problems are "in the air" and clamor for solutions. Being already
at work when the books came out, I cannot claim that my judgment about them is unbiased. But to me they seemed to demonstrate most
forcefully the necessity for the historian of style to stage a counterraid
across the psychologist's frontier. It is more than a few isolated results of psychological experiments that I hope to bring back from this foraging expedition. It is the news of a radical reorientation of all traditional ideas
about the human mind, which cannot leave the historian of art un-
affected. This reorientation is implicit in Arnheim's treatment of child art and in Ehrenzweig's ideas of unconscious perception, but their insistence on the ideas and terminology of one particular school of psychological
theory has perhaps somewhat obscured its general nature and importance. The basic terms which critics, artists, and historians have hitherto
used with confidence have lost much of their validity in this assessment.

28

INTRODUCTION

The whole idea of the "imitation of nature," of "idealization," or of "ab-

straction" rests on the assumption that what comes first are "sense im-

pressions" that are subsequently elaborated, distorted, or generalized.

K. R. Popper has dubbed these assumptions the "bucket theory of the

mind," the picture, that is, of a mind in which "sense data" are deposited

and processed. He has shown the unreality of this basic assumption in

the field of scientific method and the theory of knowledge, where he

insists on what he calls the "searchlight theory," emphasizing the activity of

the living organism that never ceases probing and testing its environment.

The fruitfulness of this approach is increasingly felt in many fields of psychology. However much theories may differ, their emphasis shifts

steadily from the stimulus to the organism's response. This response, it is

becoming clear, will be vague and general at first and gradually will

become more articulate and differentiated.

"The progress of learning is from indefinite to definite, not from

We sensation to perception.

do not learn to have percepts but to differen-

tiate them," writes J. J. Gibson, discussing vision.
"Modern research makes it probable that at first there are yet un-

organized and amorphous wholes which progressively differentiate,"

writes L. von Bertalanffy on his problems of theoretical biology.

It would be easy to parallel these quotations in the writings of Jean

Piaget on the intellectual growth of children or in those on children's

emotional development by Freud and his disciples. Even recent studies of

the way machines can be said to "learn" stress this same direction -from

the general to the particular. In the course of this book I have sometimes

referred to such parallels. I have done so with diffidence, for in these
fields I am not even a trespasser. Moreover, I am aware of the dangers of

amateurishness and the drift of fashion in such matters. In the end

there can be only one justification for the approach I advocate in this

book, if it proves useful in the day-to-day work of the historian. But

in a study of illusion I could not very well do without a theory of percep-

tion. It was here that I found it most useful to think along the lines I have

indicated, in terms of sorting and categorizing rather than in terms of

associations. The theoretical model for this approach, which ultimately

goes back to Kant, is worked out most consistently in F. A. Hayek's book

The Sensory Order. But I have profited most of all from Popper's insist-

ence on the role of anticipation and tests. In psychology this approach is

Psychology and the Riddle of Style

adopted in the theories of Bruner and Postman that "all cognitive processes, whether they take the form of perceiving, thinking, or recalling, represent 'hypotheses' which the organism sets up. . . . They require 'answers' in the form of some further experience, answers that will either
confirm or disprove them." It is in the logic of this situation, as Popper has shown, that con-
firmations of these "hypotheses" can never be more than provisional while their refutation will be final. There is no rigid distinction, therefore, between perception and illusion. Perception employs all its resources to
weed out harmful illusions, but it may sometimes fail to "disprove" a false hypothesis— for instance, when it has to deal with illusionist works
of art.
I firmly believe that some such theory of perceptual trial and error will prove fruitful in other fields than mine, but I have endeavored to
keep it in the background. My main concern was with the analysis of
image making — the way, that is, in which artists discovered some of these secrets of vision by "making and matching." What Alain's Egyptian boys had to learn before they could create an illusion of reality was not to "copy what they saw" but to manipulate those ambiguous cues on which we have to rely in stationary vision till their image was indistinguishable from reality. In other words, instead of playing "rabbit or duck" they had to invent the game of "canvas or nature," played with a configuration of colored earth which -at a distance at least -might result in illusion. Artistic or not, this is a game which could emerge only as a result of countless trials and errors. As a secular experiment in the theory of perception, illusionist art perhaps deserves attention even in a period which has discarded it for other modes of expression.
At the risk of giving away my plot, I will confess to the hurried reader
or critic that these conclusions, here anticipated, will only be presented
in full in the ninth chapter of this book, where some of the problems discussed in this introduction will be taken up again. I cannot now prevent him from going to those pages at once, but I should like to plead that a book that centers on an argument must be built like an arch. The coping stone will look as if it is hanging in the air unless it is seen to be supported by the neighboring stones. Each chapter of this book somehow
tends inwards toward the center of the problem, but the results of each
should receive support from the whole structure. The limits of likeness

imposed by the medium and the schema, the links in image making
between form and function, most of all, the analysis of the beholder's
share in the resolution of ambiguities will alone make plausible the bald
statement that art has a history because the illusions of art are not only the fruit but the indispensable tools for the artist's analysis of appearances. I hope the reader will not stop at this point but will test this idea
with me in its application to physiognomic expression and beyond that
to the borders of aesthetics, that promised land which he will only glimpse from afar.
I am well aware that this lengthy approach through the quicksands of perceptual theory puts a considerable strain on the reader who is in a
hurry to get to the emotional core of art. But I feel that these vital „ matters can be discussed with greater chance of success once the ground
has been cleared a little. I am confirmed in this conviction by a passage in Psychoanalytic Explorations in Art by my late friend and mentor Ernst Kris, with whom I so often discussed these matters and who did not live
to read this final version of the book:
"We have long come to realize that art is not produced in an empty
space, that no artist is independent of predecessors and models, that he no less than the scientist and the philosopher is part of a specific tradition and works in a structured area of problems. The degree of mastery within this framework and, at least in certain periods, the freedom to modify these stringencies are presumably part of the complex scale by which achievement is being measured. However, there is little which psychoanalysis has as yet contributed to an understanding of the meaning of this framework itself; the psychology of artistic style is unwritten."
The reader must not expect the subsequent chapters to fill the gap which Kris has shown. The psychology of representation alone cannot solve the riddle of style. There are the unexplored pressures of fashions and the mysteries of taste. But if we ever want to understand the impact of these social forces on our attitude toward representation in art -the changing prestige of mastery or the sudden disgust with triviality, the
lure of the primitive and the hectic search for alternatives that may determine the fluctuations of style -we must first try to answer the simpler
questions posed by Alain's cartoon.

5 Constable: Wivenhoe Park, Essex. 1816

From Light into Paint
Painting is the most astounding sorceress. She can persuade us through the most evident falsehoods that she is pure Truth.
Jean Etienne Liotard, Traite des principes et des
regies de la peinture
AMONG the treasures of the National Gallery of Art in Washington
hangs a painting of Wivenhoe Park in Essex by John Constable [5]. No
historical knowledge is needed to see its beauty. Anyone can enjoy the rural charm of the scene, the artist's skill and sensitivity in rendering the play of sunlight on the green pastures, the gentle ripples on the lake with its swans, and the beautiful cloudscape that encloses it all. The picture looks so effortless and natural that we accept it as an unquestioning and
unproblematic response to the beauty of the English countryside.
But for the historian there is an added attraction in this painting. He knows that this freshness of vision was won in a hard struggle. The year
1 81 6, in which Constable painted this countryseat of one of his first
patrons, marks a turning point in his artistic career. He was moving toward that conception of painting which he was later to sum up in his
lectures at Hampstead. "Painting is a science," Constable said, "and should
be pursued as an inquiry into the laws of nature. Why, then, may not
landscape painting be considered as a branch of natural philosophy, of which pictures are but the experiments?"

34

PART ONE: THE LIMITS OF LIKENESS

What Constable called "natural philosophy" we today call "physics";

the assertion that the quiet and unassuming painting of Wivenhoe Park

should be classed with the abstruse experiments of physicists in their

my laboratories must sound puzzling at first. Yet it is

conviction that

Constable's statement should not be confused with those wild utterances

with which artists sometimes like to startle and shake their complacent

contemporaries. He knew what he was talking about. In the Western

tradition, painting has indeed been pursued as a science. All the works of

this tradition that we see displayed in our great collections apply dis-

coveries that are the result of ceaseless experimentation.

If this sounds a little paradoxical, it is only because much of the

knowledge gained by these experiments in the past has become common

property today. It can be taught and applied with the same ease with

which we use the laws of the pendulum in a grandfather clock, though it

needed a Galileo to discover and a Huygens to apply them. Indeed, there

are artists who think the field to which Constable devoted his scientific

endeavors has been fully investigated by now and that they must turn to

different areas for experiment. Instead of exploring the visible world,

they probe the mysteries of the unconscious mind or test our response to

abstract shapes. Compared with these hectic activities, Constable's paint-

ing of Wivenhoe Park looks so natural and obvious that we are inclined

We to overlook its daring and its success.

accept it as simply a faithful

record of what the artist actually saw in front of him— "a mere transcript

of nature," as paintings of this kind are sometimes described, an approxi-

mation at least to that photographic accuracy against which modern

artists have rebelled. Let us admit there is something in this description.

Constable's painting is surely much more like a photograph than the works

of either a Cubist or a medieval artist. But what do we mean when we

say that the photograph, in its turn, is like the landscape it represents?

This is not a problem which is very easily discussed with the aid of

illustrations alone because illustrations will inevitably beg the question.

But it should not be too hard to demonstrate at least one of the points

where the painter's experiments adjoin those of the physicists. The two

photographs here reproduced [6, 7] were taken on the spot where Con-
stable must have stood when he painted Wivenhoe Park. For the park

still exists, though the house was much altered and the view of the lake

is now obscured by rhododendrons. What is it these pictures "transcribe"?

Surely there is not one square inch in the photograph which would be

identical with, say, a mirror image, such as one might have produced on

the spot. The reason is obvious. The black-and-white photograph only

reproduces gradations of tone between a very narrow range of grays. Not

one of these tones, of course, corresponds to what we call "reality." In-

deed, the scale depends largely on the photographer's choice in the dark-

room and is partly a matter of processing. It so happens that the two

photographs illustrated here were printed from one and the same nega-

tive. The one printed within a narrow scale of grays produces the effect

of misty light; the other, where stronger contrasts were used, gives a

different effect. The print, therefore, is not even a "mere" transcript of the

negative. The photographer who wanted to get the most out of this snap-

' shot taken on a rainy day would himself have to turn experimenter with

different exposures and different papers. If this is true of his humble

activity, how much more it will apply to the artist.

For the artist, too, cannot transcribe what he sees; he can only trans-

late it into the terms of his medium. He, too, is strictly tied to the range

of tones which his medium will yield. Where the artist works in black and

We white this transposition is easily seen.

made by Constable on almost the same spot. In one [8] he seems to have used a rather hard-pointed pencil. He had therefore to adjust all his

gradations to what is objectively a very narrow range of tones, from the

black horse in the foreground to the distant trees through which the light of the sky appears to shine, as represented by the grayish paper. In a
later drawing [9] he used a darker and cruder medium which allowed more forceful contrast. But what we call "contrast" here is actually a very
small step in the intensity of the light reflected from different areas of the
drawing. He also represented the identical view in an oil sketch [10] now
in Oxford, where the tonal gradations are translated into colored areas. Does it therefore reproduce what the artist had in front of his eyes?
It is tempting to think so. Why should not the painter be able to imitate

the colors of any object if the maker of wax images manages this trick so remarkably well? He certainly can, if he is willing to sacrifice that aspect of the visible world that is likely to interest him most, the aspect of light.
When we say that an image looks exactly like its prototype we usually mean that the two would be indistinguishable when seen side by side in
the same light. Place them in different lights and the similarity will disappear. If the difference is small, we can still restore the match by brightening the colors of the object in the dimmer light, but not if the one is in the shade and the other in sunlight. It was not for nothing that painters were advised since ancient times to have their studios facing north. For
if the painter of a portrait or a still life hopes to copy the color of his motif area by area, he must not allow a ray of sunlight to play havoc with his
procedure. Imagine him matching a white tablecloth with his whitest white— how could his palette then still yield the extra brightness of a sunlit patch or the brilliance of a sparkling reflection? The landscape painter has even less use for literal imitation. Remember once more the photographer's troubles. If he wants us to admire the wonderful autumn tints he photographed on his latest trip he will lure us into a darkened room to display his transparencies on a silver screen. Only the borrowed light of the projector lamp, aided by the adaptability of our eyes, will allow him to match the range of light intensities he had enjoyed in nature.
It so happens that Constable himself had occasion to comment on a similar expedient. He describes in a letter the new invention called the "diorama," which was on view in the 1820's. "It is in part a transparency;
the spectator is in a dark chamber, and it is very pleasing, and has great illusion. It is without [i.e., outside] the pale of the art, because its object is deception. The art pleases by reminding, not by deceiving."
Had Constable written today he would probably have used the word "suggesting." The artist cannot copy a sunlit lawn, but he can suggest it. Exactly how he does it in any particular instance is his secret, but the word of power which makes this magic possible is known to all artists -it
is "relationships."
No professional critic has seen the nature of this problem more clearly than a famous amateur artist who has taken up painting as a pastime.
But then this is no ordinary amateur but Sir Winston Churchill "It would be interesting if some real authority investigated carefully

I. From Light into Paint

the part which memory plays in painting. We look at the object with an
intent regard, then at the palette, and thirdly at the canvas. The canvas

receives a message dispatched usually a few seconds before from the natural object. But it has come through a post office en route. It has been transmitted in code. It has been turned from light into paint. It reaches

the canvas a cryptogram. Not until it has been placed in its correct rela-

tion to everything else that is on the canvas can it be deciphered, is its meaning apparent, is it translated once again from mere pigment into
light. And the light this time is not of Nature but of Art."
I am not that "real authority" on memory to whom Sir Winston appeals for an explanation of this mystery, but it seems to me that we will be able
to tackle this aspect only after we have learned more about that "trans-

mission in code" which he discusses.

II
i am not sure we are ever quite sufficiently surprised at our capacity to
read images, that is, to decipher the cryptograms of art. To Sir Winston, the "post office" and its code were no more than a brilliant metaphor, but we might do worse than take it literally. After all, post offices (in England, at least) do transmit such visual information as weather charts and photographs by means of telegraph and radio, and to do so they must in fact "code" them into simple signaling systems. The technicalities of this process need not concern us, suffice it to show that a simple but serviceable image can be translated into equal units which are either filled or empty. Any large street sign composed of electric bulbs will demonstrate this principle — a notation of which are to be "off" or "on" will create the required configuration of light. The telegraphed picture and indeed the television screen, produced as they are by the varying intensities of one beam scanning the field, illustrate the principle involved. But
before I get out of my depth I prefer to withdraw to the safer example
of art forms in which this creation of cryptograms can be studied with
greater ease. There are many media of art in which such an "on" or "off"
principle is applied— let us think of certain types of drawn work or lace in which the netting is filled in or left empty of pattern but still gives
perfect images of men and beasts [n]. It does not matter in such a

medium whether the filled-in squares represent "figure" or "ground."
All that counts is the relationship between the two signals. Maybe it was some textile technique in which reversal of relationships
was frequent and automatic that first brought home to craftsmen the fact
that the negative image is as easy to decode as the positive. It is well
known that the Greek vase painters made use of this principle of reversal when they switched over from the earlier black-figured technique [12]
to the red-figured style in which the tone of burnt clay is reserved for the figure [13]. They knew that what is needed to set off the intended shape against the nonintended ground is the relationship of contrast, of "yes" or "no," regardless of the direction of the change.
The Greeks went on from there and developed the cryptograms for the rounded form as distinct from the flat silhouette, that is, the threetone code for "modeling" in light and shade which remained basic to all

later developments of Western art. Its system is well exemplified on a South Italian vase, where the shape of the head is "heightened" with whitish paint on one side of the vase to suggest light [14] and "shaded" with a darker tone on the other side [15]. Instead of having a mere "yes"
indicate the intended form, we have the neutral tone and its two modifica-
tions toward light and darkness.

No medium illustrates the code character of this gradation more
clearly than that of the mosaic. Four graded tones of tesserae will suffice for the mosaicists of classical antiquity to suggest the basic relationships of form in space. I confess to being naive enough to admire these simple
tricks of the craftsmen who laid down the floor mosaics for villas and baths throughout the Roman Empire [16]. They exemplify the relational
cryptograms which remained in use throughout Western art, the contrast of figure and ground on the one hand and, within the figure, the modifications of the "local color" through the simple "more" or "less" of light.

As a matter of fact, we have become so obedient to the artist's suggestions that we respond with perfect ease to the notation in which black
lines indicate both the distinction between ground and figure and the gradations of shading that have become traditional in all graphic techniques. Baldung Grien's woodcut of the Fall [17] looks perfectly complete and legible to us in its notation of black and white. It is all the more

interesting to study the additional effect of the second plate [18] -one of the earliest examples of the chiaroscuro woodcut technique. By lowering the tone of the ground the artist can now use the white of the paper to indicate light. The gain from this modest extension of range is dramatic, for these indications of light not only increase the sense of modeling but also convey to us what we call "texture" -the way, that is, in which
43

light behaves when it strikes a particular surface. It is only in the chiaroscuro version of the woodcut, therefore, that we get the "feel" of the
scaly body of the serpent [19]. The three-step relationship has certainly proved an ideal instrument
for Western art in exploring our response to light. But we are also capable
of reading a two-step system in reverse, as it were. Such artists as Urs Graf successfully experimented with a technique that cuts out any indica-
tion of shading and renders only the incidence of light [20] against a dark background. Our response to relationships
suffices to make this curious notation look perfectly "nat-
ural."
The fact that all graphic techniques operate with conventional notation is, of course, familiar ground, but when it comes to painting, there is still a certain amount of confusion in the minds of the public and of the critics as to what we mean by "true to nature." The task of the painter with
his many colors seems so much simpler than that of the
graphic artist with his limited cryptograms. It is in fact more
complex. His aim of "imitation" may cut across the need for that basic information about relationships which we need
for our decoding. I must plead guilty to sharing this confu-
sion in my Story of Art when I quoted a well-known anecdote
about Constable and his patron, Sir George Beaumont : "The story goes that a friend remonstrated with him for not giving his foreground the requisite mellow brown of an old violin, and that Constable thereupon took a violin and put it before him on the grass to show the friend the difference between the fresh green as we see it and the
warm tones demanded by convention." It was an amusing gesture, but obviously we must not infer that Sir
George had never noticed that grass was green and violins brown, or that Constable made that momentous discovery. Both of them knew, of course,
that such matching will never do. The point at issue was a much more subtle one— how to reconcile what we call "local color" with the range of
tonal gradations which the landscape painter needs to suggest depth.
We find an echo of these discussions in an observation by Benjamin
West recorded in The Farington Diary: "He thinks Claude [21] began his

pictures by laying in simple gradations of flat colours from the Horizon to the top of the sky, — and from the Horizon to the foreground, witht.
putting clouds into the sky or specific forms into the landscape till He
had fully settled those gradations. -When He had satisfied himself in
this respect, He painted in his forms, by that means securing a due
gradation,— from the Horizontal line to the top of his sky,— and from the
Horizontal line to the foreground. — Smirke remarked how entirely all positive colour was avoided, even to the draperies of the figures.— Turner said He was both pleased & unhappy while He viewed it,— it seemed to be
beyond the power of imitation." These experiments with gradations from a pale blue to a mellow
brown by seventeenth- and eighteenth-century artists taught Sir George Beaumont how to suggest light and distance in a landscape. The eighteenth century had even invented a mechanical device to aid the painter in this transposition of local color into a narrower range of tones. It consisted of a curved mirror with a toned surface that was appropriately often called the "Claude glass" and was supposed to do what the black-

and-white photograph does for us, to reduce the variety of the visible
world to tonal gradations. That this method had its merits we need not
doubt. Eighteenth-century masters achieved most pleasing effects with
foregrounds of warm brown and fading distances of cool, silvery blues.
Looking at Reynolds' Lady Elizabeth Delme and Her Children in the National Gallery in Washington [26] or, for that matter, at Thomas Gainsborough's Landscape with a Bridge [22], we realize the value of an even gradation based on the brown of the foreground. Indeed, a glance at Constable's View of Salisbury Cathedral [23] convinces us that he, too, achieved the impression of light and depth by modulating tone. The difference is one of degree. Constable questioned the need to remain within the compass of one scale. He wanted to try out the effect of respecting the local color of grass somewhat more -and, indeed, in his Wivenhoe Park he is seen pushing the range more in the direction of bright greens. Only in the direction of-for, needless to say, if we would match fresh green grass against the canvas it would still be nearer to the Cremona fiddle. It is a transposition, not a copy.
Once we realize this basic fact, the master's contention that all paintings should be viewed as experiments in natural science loses much of its puzzling character. He is trying to produce what he called the "evanescent effects of nature's chiaroscuro" on canvas, within a medium which ex-
cludes matching. Indeed his experiments resulted in discoveries. For
instance, there was resistance at first against so much green, which was
thought to upset the needed tonal gradation. There is a pathetic story about Constable's sitting on the jury of the Royal Academy, of which he
was a member, when by mistake one of his own paintings was put on the
easel for judgment, and one of his colleagues said rashly, "Take that
nasty green thing away." But we also know that when his Hay Wain was shown in Paris, French artists were stimulated to repeat his experiments
and lightened their palettes. We need only walk through any major
gallery to see that in the end Constable's method found acceptance. Green
is no longer considered "nasty." We can read much brighter pictures, such
as the landscapes by Corot [24] and, what is more, enjoy the suggestion of light without missing the tonal contrasts which were thought
indispensable. We have learned a new notation and expanded the range
of our awareness.

This is the main lesson the historian should learn from the measurements of the physicists. The truth of a landscape painting is relative, the

more so the more the artist dares to accept the challenge of light. Great

scientists, such as Briicke in the nineteenth century, even drew the

conclusion from this fact that painters should not attempt sunlit scenes.

"A little more poetry and a little less midday sun would do our modern

We landscape painters a lot of good," he wrote in 1877.

now know that

he was wrong, but then it is easy for us to know it. The experiments of the

impressionist painters have convinced us that these limitations of the
medium can be overcome: a painter like Monet [25] can suggest the effect of the midday sun by exploiting the dazzle that results from its

glare, and such pictures will even gain in poetry from the artist's determi-

nation to achieve the impossible. To predict this success, Briicke would

have had to be a creative artist himself. For a scientist his objections were

perfectly rational. Too often the conflict between the artist and the public,

between tradition and innovation, is told without regard for that simple
fact. On the one side we are shown the purblind public, bred on false-

hoods; on the other the artist, who sees the truth. History based on this

fallacy can never be good history. And nothing may help us to overcome

these limitations better than Constable's description of landscape painting

as an inquiry into the laws of nature.

It is only in one respect that we should perhaps amend his formulation. What a painter inquires into is not the nature of the physical world

but the nature of our reactions to it. He is not concerned with causes but with the mechanisms of certain effects. His is a psychological problem —

that of conjuring up a convincing image despite the fact that not one

individual shade corresponds to what we call "reality." In order to understand this puzzle— as far as we can claim to understand it as yet —

science had to explore the capacity of our minds to register relationships

rather than individual elements.

Ill

same whatever the key it is played in, so we respond to light intervals, to
what have been called "gradients," rather than to the measurable quantity of light reflected from any given object. And when I say "we," I include
newly hatched chickens and other fellow creatures who so obligingly
answer the questions psychologists put to them. According to a classic
experiment by Wolfgang Kohler, you can take two gray pieces of paper — one dark, one bright -and teach the chickens to expect food on the brighter of the two. If you then remove the darker piece and replace it by
one brighter than the other one, the deluded creatures will look for their dinner, not on the identical gray paper where they have always found it,
but on the paper where they would expect it in terms of relationships —
that is, on the brighter of the two. Their little brains are attuned to gradients rather than to individual stimuli. Things could not go well with
' them if nature had willed it otherwise. For would a memory of the exact stimulus have helped them to recognize the identical paper? Hardly ever! A cloud passing over the sun would change its brightness, and so might even a tilt of the head, or an approach from a different angle. If what we
call "identity" were not anchored in a constant relationship with environment, it would be lost in the chaos of swirling impressions that never
repeat themselves.
What we get on the retina, whether we are chickens or human
beings, is a welter of dancing light points stimulating the sensitive rods
and cones that fire their messages into the brain. What we see is a stable
world. It takes an effort of the imagination and a fairly complex apparatus to realize the tremendous gulf that exists between the two. Consider any
object, such as a book or a piece of paper. When we scan it with our
eyes it projects upon our two retinas a restless, flitting pattern of light of various wave lengths and intensities. This pattern will hardly ever repeat itself exactly — the angle at which we look, the light, the size of our pupils, all these will have changed. The white light a piece of paper reflects when turned toward the window is a multiple of what it reflects
when turned away. It is not that we do not notice some change; indeed, we must if we want to form an estimate of the illumination. But we are never conscious of the objective degree of all these changes unless we use
what psychologists call a "reduction screen," in essence a peephole that
makes us see a speck of color but masks off its relationships. Those who

rarely confuse the one with the other because

the coal will on the whole be the blackest patch in our field of vision, the

handkerchief the whitest, and it is relative brightness that matters and
that we are aware of. The coding process of which Sir Winston Churchill

speaks begins while en route between the retina and our conscious minds. The term which psychology has coined for our relative imperviousness to

the dizzy variations that go on in the world around us is "constancy." The color, shape, and brightness of things remain to us relatively constant,
even though we may notice some variation with the change of distance,

illumination, angle of vision, and so on. Our room remains the same room from dawn through midday to dusk, and the objects in it retain their shape and color. Only when we are faced with special tasks involving
attention to these matters do we become aware of uncertainties. We

would not judge the color of an unfamiliar fabric in artificial light, and

A so with colors. faint light is disturbing at first, but with the aid of the

physiological adaptation of the eye we soon get the feel of relationships,

and the world assumes its familiar face.
Without this faculty of man and beast alike to recognize identities across the variations of difference, to make allowance for changed condi-

tions, and to preserve the framework of a stable world, art could not exist.
When we open our eyes under water we recognize objects, shapes, and colors although through an unfamiliar medium. When we first see
pictures we see them in an unfamiliar medium. This is more than a mere pun. The two capacities are interrelated. Every time we meet with an unfamiliar type of transposition, there is a brief moment of shock and a period of adjustment -but it is an adjustment for which the mechanism

exists in us.

1 suspect that somewhere here lies the preliminary answer to the question of how far we must learn to read such images as line drawings or black-and-white photographs and of how far this capacity is inborn. As far as I can make out, primitive tribes that have never seen such images are not necessarily able to read them. But it would be wrong to conclude from this fact that the symbolism of photography is merely conventional. It appears to be learned with surprising speed once the nature of the required adjustment is understood.
I believe that something similar accounts for both the initial difficulty
and the subsequent ease in adjusting ourselves to new types of notations in painting. To eyes used to the style of Fantin-Latour's Portrait of Sonia [27], Manet's Madame Michel-Levy [28] must at first have looked
as harsh and glaring as sunlight looks to the deep-sea diver.
It is once more in Constable's correspondence that we find rich docu-
mentation of this difficulty which besets the path of the artist-innovator. Hearing of that rare bird, a prospective buyer for one of his landscapes, the
embittered painter writes : "Had I not better grime it down with slime and
soot, as he is a connoisseur, and perhaps prefers filth and dirt to freshness and beauty?" "Rubbed out and dirty canvases," he writes elsewhere, "take
the place of God's own works." Intent as he was on the rendering of light,
he could not but deplore and despise the visual habits of the public that had
adjusted its eyes to the gloom of old varnish. His point of view, as we know, has prevailed. The yellow varnish that was spread over paintings in the nineteenth century to give them what was called a "gallery tone" has
disappeared with the Claude glass. We have been taught to look into
light without putting on black spectacles. But it would be a little rash to assume that this revolution has at last
given us the truth and that we now know what pictures should look like. Constable rightly deplored the visual habits of those who were used to
looking at dirty canvases, and he went so far as to deplore the founding of
the National Gallery in London, which would mean "the end of art in poor old England." But today the position may be reversed. The brighter
palette, the strong and even loud colors to which first impressionism and

then twentieth-century paintings (not to mention posters and neon lights) have
inured us may have made it difficult for us
to accept the quiet tonal gradations of
earlier styles. The National Gallery in London has now become the focus of discussion about the degree of adjustment we should be prepared to make when we look
at old paintings. I venture to think this issue is too fre-
quently described as a conflict between the objective methods of science and the subjective impressions of artists and critics. The objective validity of the methods used in the laboratories of our great galleries is as little in doubt as the good faith of those
who apply them. But it may well be argued
that restorers, in their difficult and re-

sponsible work, should take account not only of the chemistry of pigments but
also of the psychology of perception — ours and that of the chicken. What we want of them is not to restore individual
pigments to their pristine color, but something infinitely more tricky and delicate to preserve relationships. It is particularly
the impression of light, as we know, that
rests exclusively on gradients and not, as one might expect, on the objective brightness of the colors. Wherever we observe a sudden steep rise in the brightness of a

ing through the eye of the Pantheon in Pannini's attractive picture [30].

Once more it is the sharp edge of the patch of light that creates the il-
lusion. Mask it off and the impression of light will largely disappear. I am

told that this fact presents a problem of which the restorer must learn to be

aware. Whenever he starts the process of cleaning, he will produce a similar

difference in brightness, an unexpected gradient which will look as if light

were streaming into the picture. It is a psychological effect cleverly ex-

ploited by an amusing poster of the National Clean-up Paint-up Fix-up
Bureau [31]. But I would not send my pictures to that admirable institution

for treatment. This seductive impression of daylight dispelling the gloom

is created within the picture; the gradient which causes it will disappear
when the cleaning is finished. As soon as we are then attuned to the new

key of brightness, the constancies come into their own and the mind returns

We to its proper business of assessing gradients and relationships.
