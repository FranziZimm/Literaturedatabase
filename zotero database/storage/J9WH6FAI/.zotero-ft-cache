Editorial Policy
International Journal of Language Studies is seeking submissions of previously unpublished manuscripts on any topic related to the area of language study. Articles should be written so that they are accessible to a broad audience, including those individuals who may not be familiar with the particular subject matter addressed in the article. Articles should report on original research or present original content that links to previous research, theory, and/or teaching practices. Contributors should note that articles containing only descriptions of software, classroom procedures, or those presenting results of attitude surveys without discussing data on actual language learning outcomes will not be considered. Full-length articles should be no more than 10,000 words in length, including references and appendices, and should include an abstract of no more than 150 words. Decision as to whether longer (i.e., up to a maximum of 25,000 words) papers will be accepted or not depends on IJLS reviewers' comments as well as the quality of the manuscript itself.
Submission of an article implies that the work described has not been published previously (except in the form of an abstract or as part of a published lecture or academic thesis), that it is not under consideration for publication elsewhere, that its publication is approved by all authors and tacitly or explicitly by the responsible authorities where the work was carried out, and that it will not be published elsewhere in the same form, in English or in any other language, without the written consent of International Journal of Language Studies. Authors should acknowledge these points in a cover letter that accompanies their manuscript.
Receipt of manuscripts will be acknowledged, but they cannot be returned; therefore, authors should retain a copy of the paper exactly as it was submitted. Since page proofs cannot be sent to authors for last minute corrections, authors must proofread manuscripts carefully, giving special attention to the accuracy of quotations and references. Acceptance of an article means that authors have transferred copyright to IJLS. Authors are encouraged to download the copyright transfer form from the journal site, complete it, and sign and send it to IJLS via surface mail or through a fax machine. This transfer will ensure the widest possible dissemination of information. If excerpts from other copyrighted works are included, the author(s) must obtain written permission from the copyright owners and credit the source(s) in the article.
All article manuscripts submitted to International Journal of Language Studies (IJLS) go through a two-step review process.
v

Step 1: Internal Review
The editor(s) of the journal first review each manuscript to see if it meets the basic requirements for articles published in the journal (i.e., that it reports on original research or presents original content that links to previous research, theory, and/or teaching practices), and that it is of sufficient quality to merit external review. Manuscripts which do not meet these requirements are not sent out for further review, and authors of these manuscripts are encouraged to submit their work elsewhere. This internal review may take up to about 6 weeks. Following the internal review, authors are notified by e-mail as to whether their manuscript has been sent out for external review or, if not, why not. Authors can get their papers sent out for external review by making sure that:
x the copyright transfer form is completed, signed, and sent to IJLS; x a cover letter accompanies the manuscript; x they have cited papers from earlier issues of IJLS in their works; x first person usage has been avoided for more clarity in the paper; x no or very little formatting is used; x the manuscript is strictly blind; x the manuscript follows APA Editorial Style; x the manuscript title is concise (preferably fewer than 10 words) and
adequately descriptive of the content of the article; x the manuscript is accompanied by an abstract of about 100-150 words; x the abstract is written so as to provide the substance of the full paper; x the manuscript is in native or acceptable native-like English; x a set of 5 to 8 keywords separated by semicolon follows the abstract; x paragraphs are not indented and no tabs are used; x typeface is Cambria, Times New Roman, Georgia or Courier New; x Arial typeface has NOT been used in any part of the manuscript; x if their work contains phonetic/African/complex non-English symbols,
they have embedded all fonts in their DOC file and have also sent a PDF version of the manuscript; x no manual hyphenation is used (i.e., Space bar on the keyboard should not be used for indenting text); x quotations longer than 40 words appear as separate blocks without quotation marks; x all citations are referenced and all references are cited; x no headers and/or footers are used whatsoever; x no pagination is used; x tables and figures appear in the correct position, are numbered consecutively, and are captioned according to APA Editorial Style;
vi

x graphics in the manuscript are only in black-and-white or patterned format;
x gray shading is not used in diagrams and tables; x the manuscript is only saved in Microsoft Word 2003 DOC format; and x a separate file including author data (e.g., full name, affiliation, country,
email, short biography) and acknowledgments is also submitted.
Step 2: External Review
Submissions which meet the basic requirements are then sent out for blind peer review from 3-4 experts in the field, either from the journal's editorial board or from our larger list of reviewers. This second review process takes 4-6 months. Following the external review, the authors are sent copies of the external reviewers' comments and are notified as to the decision (accept as is, accept pending changes, revise and resubmit, or reject). Our reviewers make decisions based on a set of considerations; if authors know about their standards, they can take a strong step in getting their work published in IJLS. We, therefore, suggest that before submitting their work to IJLS, authors should make sure that:
x the paper is easy to read and free from grammatical or spelling errors; x the paper is based on rigorous academic standards; x the paper is presented in a format which is accessible by IJLS audience; x the paper focuses on justification, results and implementation, and has
readable content cast in APA Editorial Style; x technical material (e.g., guide to phonetic symbols, questionnaires, etc.) is
appendixed; x the paper has clarity of presentation, is well organised and clearly written. x the paper makes a significant contribution to the body of knowledge
related to IJLS; x the topic is highly significant, breaks new ground, and provides a
foundation for future research; x the topic of the paper is relevant, timely, and of interest to the audience of
IJLS; x the rationale for the paper is well grounded; it is based on a known theory
or on an interesting issue; x The research methodology for the study is appropriate and applied
properly; x the material of the paper is technically accurate and sound; x if this paper is a survey, it provides strong evidence of reliability and
validity of the constructs; x discussion of the results is based on analysis of data; x results are not overstated or overgeneralized; and x implications and recommendations are relevant and useful.

How to Submit Manuscripts Contributors should submit their contributions in electronic form, as email attachment or on a computer disk. A short biographical note of the author/s is required as well as a complete address (in a separate file). Contributions should be sent to the editor in chief at: ijls.editors@yahoo.com. The electronic manuscript should be strictly anonymous; authors should not identify themselves in the electronic manuscript itself, or in the filename used for the manuscript. Legal Notice According to the guidelines available from the official website of International Journal of Language Studies, submission of a paper to IJLS means that the author(s) are automatically transferring the copyright for their work to the editor-in-chief no matter whether the submission is accompanied by the completed and autographed copyright form or not. Submission of a paper to International Journal of Language Studies also means that (a) the author has not made double or parallel submissions elsewhere, and (b) the paper has not been previously published, presented, or disseminated elsewhere.

Clinical linguistics: A primer
Louise CUMMINGS, Nottingham Trent University, UK
Clinical linguistics is an important and growing area of language study. Yet, this linguistic discipline has been relatively overlooked in comparison with mainstream branches of linguistics such as syntax and semantics. This paper argues for a greater integration of clinical linguistics within linguistics in general. This integration is warranted, it is argued, on account of the knowledge and methods that clinical linguists share with academics in other areas of linguistics. The paper sets out by discussing a narrow and a broad definition of clinical linguistics before examining key stages in the human communication cycle. This cycle represents the cognitive and linguistic processes involved in the expression and interpretation of utterances. Language and communication disorders are characterized in terms of specific points of breakdown in this cycle. The contribution of each branch of linguistic study—phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics and discourse—to an analysis of language disorders is considered. Data from a range of clinical subjects, both children and adults, is used to illustrate the linguistic features of these disorders. The paper concludes with a summary of the main points of the discussion and a preview of a companion article to be published in the International Journal of Language Studies.

1. Introduction
This paper will introduce the reader to a branch of linguistics that is often overlooked by academic linguists. That branch is called clinical linguistics. Despite the relative neglect of clinical linguistics in the curriculum of most university linguistics courses, it will be demonstrated that this important application of linguistic concepts and theories has the potential to extend the study of language in interesting and novel ways. The discussion will be

developed along the following lines. In section 2, a narrow and a broad definition of clinical linguistics will be considered. These definitions are examined, not as a means of constraining the discussion, but simply with a view to providing some focus for what could otherwise be a very broad and unwieldy account. This section will also consider a number of other disciplines which more traditional areas of linguistic study can overlook, but which clinical linguists must fully embrace.
In section 3, an overview is presented of the different clinical conditions in which language is impaired. To facilitate this discussion, the human communication cycle is presented with each category of language disorder indicated as a point of breakdown in this cycle. In section 4, the language impairments of several clinical populations are examined in relation to the disciplines that are most closely identified as integral to the study of linguistics. These disciplines are phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics and discourse. Data from clinical subjects will be used to demonstrate specific features of language breakdown. The paper will conclude with a summary of the main points of discussion as well as a preview of a companion article to be published in the International Journal of Language Studies entitled “Clinical linguistics: State of the art.”
2. Definitions of clinical linguistics
A linguist, who has had a very profound influence on the development of clinical linguistics, provides us with the first of two definitions which will be examined in this section. The linguist in question is David Crystal1 and his definition of the field unfolds as follows: clinical linguistics is “the application of linguistic theories and methods to the analysis of disorders of spoken, written, or signed language” (Crystal, 1997, p. 418). Crystal’s definition is important in at least two respects. The first respect is that it lays the ground for applying any theoretical framework or linguistic method to the study of language disorders. Accordingly, there is a place for linguistic theories such as optimality theory and relevance theory within the study of language disorder. Optimality theory has been applied to the study of phonological disorders
1 Some indication of David Crystal’s influence on clinical linguistics can be gauged from his numerous and varied publications in the area over a period of many years. These publications commenced in 1976 with the publication of The Grammatical Analysis of Language Disability with Paul Fletcher and Michael Garman. They included four editions of the book Introduction to Language Pathology between 1980 and 1998 with Rosemary Varley. More recently, Crystal has written the foreword to the volume Methods in Teaching Clinical Linguistics and Phonetics, which is edited by Nicole Whitworth and Rachael-Anne Knight and which contains a chapter on Pragmatics by the author (Cummings, 2013a).

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 1-30 3
(see Stemberger & Bernhardt (1997) for discussion), while relevance theory has played a less prominent, but nonetheless important, role in the investigation of pragmatic disorders (see Cummings (2009, 2014) for discussion of relevance theory in a clinical context). Similarly, linguistic methods as wide-ranging as conducting experiments and undertaking phonetic transcription to recording and analysing conversations are as integral to the work of clinical linguists as they are to the investigations undertaken by psycholinguists, phoneticians and discourse and conversation analysts. Crystal’s definition places the full gamut of linguistic theories and methods at the service of clinical linguists, who have employed both over the years to very good effect.
The second respect in which Crystal’s definition is important is that it widens the focus of language disorders to include disorders of written and signed language as well as spoken language. There can be little doubt that the clinical study of language has been unduly preoccupied with speech and oral communication over other language modalities. Clinical language assessment has traditionally privileged the auditory-oral language route over reading, writing and signing. Similarly, goals of clinical language intervention have almost exclusively involved gains in spoken language comprehension and the intelligibility of speech as opposed to improved functioning in other language areas. The traditional emphasis on speech has even been reflected in the titles of the professionals who assess and treat clients with language disorders, as well as in the nomenclature of the professional bodies which represent these clinicians. The term ‘speech therapist’ in the UK was only replaced by ‘speech and language therapist’ in 1990, while the College of Speech Therapists became the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists in 1995. The dominance of speech and spoken language has resulted in the relative neglect of non-verbal communication and written language disorders both as topics of academic study and as priorities for clinical research. More recently, the development of areas such as augmentative and alternative communication is beginning to redress this imbalance. It is an imbalance which has no place in clinical linguistics, as Crystal’s definition quite clearly demonstrates.
So Crystal’s definition of clinical linguistics has much to commend it. However, it still views language disorders largely as phenomena to be ‘analysed’, as if these disorders can be abstracted from the individuals who have them and treated as interesting topics of academic study. As well as regarding language disorders as phenomena to be ‘analysed’, these disorders must be viewed as conditions which have predominantly adverse effects upon the lives of the children and adults who experience them. As such, language disorders should be assessed and treated with a view to mitigating these effects rather than merely analysed. (Of course, Crystal would not disagree with this point. It is simply that it is not a feature of his definition.)

4 L. Cummings
One cannot talk about the assessment and treatment of language disorders without acknowledging the work of the clinicians who make this possible. These clinicians, known as speech and language therapists in the UK (or speech-language pathologists in the US), are included within an expanded definition of clinical linguistics proposed by the author in 2008:
‘Clinical linguistics is the study of the numerous ways in which the unique human capacity for language can be disordered. This includes ‘language disorders’, as standardly conceived. However, it also includes disorders that result from disruption to the wider processes of language transmission and reception [. . .] Most notably, it includes all the disorders that are encountered by speech and language therapists across a range of clinical contexts’ (Cummings, 2008, p. 1).
Like Crystal’s definition, this expanded definition gives emphasis to all the ways in which language is received and transmitted. The stated ‘wider processes’ include reading, writing and signing in addition to speech and hearing. Through the use of the terms ‘transmission’ and ‘reception’, the expressive and receptive uses of language are emphasized. (This is another feature not explicitly addressed in Crystal’s definition, but which he would not wish to challenge.) So this expanded definition retains Crystal’s emphasis on non-oral forms of language, while at the same time bringing the clinical profession which assesses and treats clients with language disorders clearly into focus. To me at least, this is a sine qua non of any definition that is attempting to characterize a clinical discipline.
So we can see one important way in which clinical linguistics differs from other branches of language study. It is simply not meaningful to discuss this field of linguistics in isolation from its clinical practice in the form of speech and language therapy. But clinical linguistics differs from other branches of language study in another fundamental respect. The knowledge base of the clinical linguist is a very broad one indeed. As well as possessing linguistic concepts and theories, the clinical linguist must have an understanding of relevant areas within a number of medical disciplines. Understanding aphasia in the adult who sustains a cerebrovascular accident or stroke, a voice disorder in the individual who develops a laryngeal carcinoma, and language disturbances in clients with schizophrenia requires a sound grasp of aspects of neurology, otolaryngology and psychiatry, respectively. Knowledge of genetics and embryology is integral to an understanding of the large number of genetic and chromosomal disorders in which there are significant language, speech and hearing disorders. Beyond medicine, the clinical linguist must be acquainted with disciplines such as child development, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience. These are not areas which must be embraced

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 1-30 5
by academic linguists, but they are very much part of the working knowledge of clinical linguists. This will become increasingly evident in later sections as we examine some of the disorders studied by clinical linguists.
3. The human communication cycle
The communication of any linguistic utterance, via speech, writing or signing, is a complex activity that involves the interplay of a large number of cognitive and linguistic processes. From the most abstract level of generating a communicative intention to the movement of specific articulators across dimensions of space and time, these processes must act in concert with each other across increasingly concrete levels of linguistic planning, programming and speech execution. In this section, we examine the different stages that lead from the generation of a communicative intention by one language user to the recovery of that intention by another language user. The communication cycle through which we will wend our way will have illustrative value in a couple of respects. Firstly, it will allow us to locate each main category of disorder studied by clinical linguists to a specific point of breakdown in the human communication cycle. Secondly, the cycle will also allow us to demonstrate how each branch of linguistics can be applied to the study of distinct phases in the formulation and understanding of linguistic utterances and disorders thereof. For example, concepts in semantics will be shown to be integral to the study of semantic disorders in aphasia, with the latter represented as a breakdown in the stages of language encoding and decoding in the communication cycle. With each category of language disorder characterized in terms of the communication cycle, the stage will then be set for an examination of those disorders in section 4.
Among the many thoughts and mental states that speakers entertain, only some are communicated to others. What motivates some thoughts to become communicative intentions, while others are overlooked or dismissed, is a diverse set of considerations including the speaker’s needs in a particular situation and his or her interests at a certain point in time. The generation of communicative intentions is a poorly understood process, with everything from the form or structure of these intentions to their relationship to other mental states still essentially unknown. Certainly, theories of pragmatic interpretation tend to treat communicative intentions as a given, with the thrust of these accounts devoted to explaining the linguistic and other processes that speakers use to make these intentions manifest to hearers. Having established a communicative intention, a speaker (writer or sign user) must then translate it into a linguistic code in a stage of processing known as language encoding. During this stage, specific syntactic, semantic and phonological structures are constructed in accordance with rules and principles which constrain the ultimate linguistic form of the utterance. These

6 L. Cummings
rules prohibit certain syntactic sequences such as the use of a main verb before an auxiliary verb within an utterance marked as declarative (e.g., *The man walking was across the road). These rules also specify acceptable sound sequences for the speaker’s native language, so that while the consonant cluster /ăk/ is acceptable at the end of words in English (e.g., ‘link’), it is not acceptable at the beginning of words.
Even a linguistically encoded communicative intention is still an abstract entity in terms of the further stages of processing that are needed to transform it into an utterance which can be articulated by a speaker. An abstract linguistic specification of an utterance must undergo a stage called motor programming, during which a series of motor patterns are selected and arranged with the aim of directing the activity of the articulators. It is these motor patterns which will ensure the correct timing and sequencing of articulatory movements and coordination of these movements with other components of the speech production mechanism (e.g., phonation, respiration). However, these motor patterns are still somewhat removed from the neuromuscular messages which will be sent to the speech musculature. It is these messages which will ensure that the tongue adopts a particular posture for the articulation of alveolar and velar plosives, and that the vocal folds vibrate to produce voicing on /b/ but not on /p/. These neuromuscular messages are issued to the speech production mechanism (or the muscles of the arms and hands in the case of writing and signing) in a stage of processing called motor execution. These various stages in the production or expression of a linguistic utterance are demonstrated in Figure 1 below.
Of course, to this point in the communication cycle, no message as such has been communicated. The communication of a message can only truly be said to have occurred when the hearer recovers the intention which was the speaker’s motivation for producing the utterance. For this to happen, a number of receptive language processes must now come into play, the first of which is called sensory processing (see Figure 1). During sensory processing, the acoustic signal emitted by the speaker triggers mechanical and other forces in the ear which result in neurophysiological events. Key landmarks in this process include the conversion of sound waves into movements of the tympanic membrane, the vibration of the ossicular chain in the middle ear and the displacement of the stereocilia of hair cells by the movement of cochlear fluid in the inner ear. These events culminate in the transmission of neural impulses along the auditory nerve to the auditory cortices of the brain. These auditory centres achieve the perception or recognition of the neural impulses which travel to the brain. As well as being able to identify the sound of a car engine and the bark of a dog, the hearer can perceive and recognize sounds within the frequency range of human speech. The recognition of

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 1-30 7
speech sounds occurs during speech perception (see Figure 1). The perception of the speech signal marks the beginning of language decoding.
Figure 1. The human communication cycle. During language decoding, phonological, syntactic and semantic rules operate on a linguistic representation of the utterance, revealing structural and other relationships which will have symbolic significance. In this way, a linguistic representation of the utterance The car was followed by the van will not only make explicit the passive voice construction indicated by the verb, but will also identify the van as the semantic agent in the utterance. The linguistic representation which makes explicit these meaning relations is only sometimes revealing of the communicative intention which motivated the speaker to produce the utterance. For example, on some occasions a syntactic structure in which a subject pronoun and auxiliary verb is inverted (e.g., Did you leave early this morning?) is intended by the speaker as an interrogative. In this case, the utterance’s decoded linguistic meaning is the same as the meaning intended by the speaker. However, on other occasions, this same syntactic structure (e.g., Can you open the window?) is not intended as an interrogative by the speaker, and the utterance’s decoded linguistic meaning must undergo further processing of its pragmatic meaning (which, in this case, is a request). This additional linguistic and cognitive processing is only complete when the communicative intention, which motivated the speaker to produce the utterance, is finally revealed. With the different stages of the communication cycle laid bare, it is now possible to introduce the various disorders that arise when these stages are

8 L. Cummings
impaired. Many children and adults have clinical disorders which compromise their ability to generate suitable communicative intentions. The child with Down’s syndrome may lack the intellectual skills which are needed to formulate a communicative intention that is appropriate to context. The child or adult with an autism spectrum disorder may formulate a communicative intention which is irrelevant to a particular conversational exchange. The adult with schizophrenia may have difficulty suppressing certain communicative intentions with the result that his language may be interpreted as bizarre or even threatening on occasion. Even when a communicative intention is successfully framed, the processes involved in language encoding may be disrupted. Adult clients with an expressive aphasia may be unable to perform a range of syntactic operations including those that are needed to generate passive voice constructions and form whinterrogatives (e.g., Where is the milk?). The child with specific language impairment may omit inflectional suffixes during the encoding of an utterance or employ a suffix incorrectly (e.g., He walk to school; They wented to town). The child with phonological disorder may substitute velar plosives with alveolar plosives during language encoding, leading to phonological errors such as [teik] for ‘cake’.
An utterance may undergo language encoding successfully only to encounter disruption at the stage of motor programming. A motor programming disorder which has an adverse effect on speech intelligibility is developmental verbal dyspraxia in children and apraxia of speech in adults. In both conditions, the speaker is unable to perform speech-related movements in the absence of any evident neurological impairment (non-speech, oral movements may also be compromised if there is an accompanying oral apraxia). The result is that articulatory movements are mistimed and poorly sequenced, leading to substitution, transposition, omission and anticipation of speech sounds. These speech errors will be examined in section 4. The programmed utterance may contain the requisite motor patterns that are needed to produce the utterance. However, if these motor patterns are operationalized along an impaired or degraded motor pathway to the speech production mechanism, then an unintelligible utterance will be the result. Just such a scenario occurs in children and adults with dysarthria, a motor speech disorder in which the execution of an utterance is compromised. Dysarthria can occur in individuals with a range of neurological disorders including cerebral palsy, cerebrovascular accidents, traumatic brain injury and motor neurone disease. Some of the speech distortions that occur in developmental and acquired dysarthria will be examined in the next section.
Receptive language processes may also be disrupted as a result of disease, illness or injury. The stage of sensory processing in the communication cycle is impaired in children and adults with congenital and acquired hearing loss

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 1-30 9
and visual impairment. (Visual impairment holds particular significance for the sign user, but may also compromise verbal communication). The ossicular chain in the middle ear may not develop or vibrate normally in children with Apert’s syndrome, or it may become degraded in adults as a result of otosclerosis. In both cases, a conductive hearing loss may result. The hair cells in the cochlea may be damaged in the infant who contracts meningitis, while the stereocilia of these cells may be fractured as a consequence of repeated noise exposure in adults. The resulting hearing loss in both cases is sensorineural in nature. Even if the nervous impulses from the inner ear to the auditory centres in the brain are not degraded, they may fail to be recognized by these centres for a number of reasons. The auditory centres in the brain may contain lesions as a result of infections (e.g., meningitis), vascular disorders (e.g., a stroke), traumatic events (e.g., traumatic brain injury) or seizures (e.g., Landau-Kleffner syndrome). In each of these cases, speech perception may be disrupted, with the result that an otherwise intact auditory signal may not be adequately perceived or recognized.
Even an adequately perceived speech signal cannot guarantee that an utterance will be successfully decoded. The child with specific language impairment may incorrectly identify the mouse as the semantic agent in the utterance The mouse was chased by the cat. This may be on account of his failure to decode the passive voice construction in this utterance—the child treats the sentence as an active voice construction in which the mouse is the grammatical subject. The adult with Broca’s aphasia may interpret this same utterance to mean that the mouse was chasing the cat, because his syntactic impairment may cause him to overlook the inflectional suffix –ed on the verb chased. A quite different category of language disorder obtains when a client is able to decode a linguistic utterance but is then unable to use its decoded meaning to derive a further (implicated) level of meaning. This scenario occurs in children and adults with pragmatic disorders often in the context of an intellectual disability, an autism spectrum disorder or a psychotic disorder such as schizophrenia. Pragmatic disorders have been characterized at length elsewhere (Cummings, 2009, 2014) and will be examined in the next section. But what they all have in common is a failure to move beyond the decoded meaning of an utterance in order to arrive at the communicative intention which motivated the utterance.
The failure to establish a speaker’s communicative intention completes the survey of ways in which the communication cycle may be impaired or disrupted. It can be seen that these impairments include congenital disorders (e.g., hearing loss in the child with Apert’s syndrome) as well as acquired conditions (e.g., apraxia of speech in the adult who sustains a stroke). Some of these impairments resolve spontaneously over time (e.g., dysfluency in young children), while many others persist despite intensive periods of intervention

(e.g., aphasia in adults). Some of the impairments that were discussed are essentially static in nature. For example, dysarthria in a child with cerebral palsy will change as the child develops, but will not deteriorate with maturation. (This is because the underlying neurological impairment which causes the dysarthria is stable). Other impairments are progressive and deteriorate over weeks or months (e.g., dysarthria in an adult with motor neurone disease, a neurodegenerative condition which worsens over time).
In all these cases, the clinical linguist must have a sound understanding of the complex medical aetiologies associated with communication impairments. Among these aetiologies are infections (e.g., meningitis), vascular disorders (e.g., cerebrovascular accidents), neoplasms (e.g., laryngeal carcinoma), anatomical malformations (e.g., cleft palate), traumatic events (e.g., traumatic brain injury) and genetic and chromosomal abnormalities (e.g., Down’s syndrome). Clearly, the clinical linguist must engage with a large range of medical conditions which are not of concern to academics in other branches of linguistics. But like other linguists, the clinical linguist must also draw extensively on his knowledge of linguistic concepts and methods to understand the communication impairments we have just examined. It is to this aspect of the clinical linguist’s knowledge that we now turn.
4. Linguistics and language disorders
The clinical linguist is, first and foremost, a linguist. As such, he comes to the study of language disorders with concepts, terminology and methods which form part of the working knowledge of any academic linguist. This section will examine some of these terms, concepts and methods as they are applied by the clinical linguist to the study of language disorders. To ensure consistency and evenness of treatment, each branch of linguistics will be examined in turn. These branches are phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics and discourse. Alongside a brief description of its scope of study, each branch will then be examined with a view to its role in the characterization of specific language disorders. This will not be (nor can it be) an exhaustive treatment of these disorders. For such a treatment, the reader is referred to Cummings (2008, 2013b). There have been many theoretical developments in linguistics which have also contributed insights to the study of language disorders. These developments are significant and, as such, are worthy of discussion. However, they will be addressed in the companion article to this paper, entitled “Clinical linguistics: State of the art.” The emphasis of this section will be on the demonstration of the different ways in which language can be disrupted in children and adults, and how linguistics may be used to characterize those ways. Where it has illustrative value, data from clinical subjects will be examined.

4.1. Phonetics
Phonetics is the study of human speech sounds. The field includes a number of sub-disciplines: the study of the articulatory movements that are required to produce speech sounds (articulatory phonetics); the measurement of the physical dimensions (e.g., frequency) of speech sounds (acoustic phonetics); and the study of the perception of speech sounds (auditory/perceptual phonetics). Phoneticians have a rich terminology at their disposal to describe all aspects of the production of speech sounds. This terminology includes labels for the organs of articulation (e.g., velum), the place of speech sound articulation (e.g., bilabial) and the manner of articulation (e.g., plosive). Speech sounds may be further characterized in terms of phonatory characteristics such as voicing, such that the speech sounds /p, s, f/ are voiceless consonants while /b, z, v/ are their voiced counterparts. Additional phonetic labels describe the type of airstream that is used during the production of speech sounds (e.g., pulmonic, glottalic) and the direction of the airstream, whether that is ingressive or egressive.
Phonetics is integral to the work of the clinical linguist, so much so in fact that it is simply not possible to give a characterization of this work without reference to phonetic terms and concepts. It is phonetics that allows us to characterize the distortions in the speech of the child with cleft palate or the adult with dysarthria as markedly deviant in nature, and not simply as variations in normal speech production of the type seen in regional dialects, for example. Some of these deviant articulations are shown below with their original phonetic transcriptions:

Data 1: Child with developmental dysarthria (Harris & Cottam, 1985) ‘penny’ [ᢥᖡᢜᢛ] ‘cotton’ [kxᢍӁᖠn] ‘boat’ [bo:ᏆӁ]

Data 2: Children with congenital deafness (Smith, 1975)

‘mean to’ [min ᖠ stu]

‘it’ [ᢛçt]

‘new dog’ [nusdᖜɖk]

‘tell’ [tsᖡ]

Data 3: Child with developmental verbal dyspraxia (Marquardt, Jacks, & Davis, 2004) ‘plate’ [pleᢛt] [peᢛt] [pᖡt] [pleᢛ]

Data 4: Adult with acquired dysarthria (Ball, Müller, Klopfenstein, & Rutter, 2009) I’ll ask you a few questions [ǁ ǁᢺӀ s] (0.25 s) questions [kwᖡӲᖮӀ s]

Data 5: Child with cleft palate (Howard, 1993)

‘go’ [Ꮖᖠᖲ]

‘key’ [Ꮖi]

‘tea’ [Ꮖi]

‘dog’ [ᏆᢍᏆᦘ]

12 L. Cummings
The child with developmental dysarthria in data 1 is substituting voiceless plosives with fricative sounds. The /p/ of ‘penny’ is replaced by the voiceless bilabial fricative [ᢥ], while word-medial and word-final /t/ in ‘cotton’ and ‘boat’, respectively, are replaced with the slit articulation [Ӂ]. Additionally, although this child succeeds in producing /k/ in word-initial position in ‘cotton’, this articulation is accompanied by the voiceless velar fricative [x]. In data 2, children with congenital deafness are inserting a fricative during the formation or release of a stop. Thus, we find the alveolar fricative [s] occurring in the formation of [t] and [d] in ‘mean to’ and ‘new dog’, respectively. This same fricative is also used in the release of [t] in ‘tea’. The voiceless palatal fricative [ç] occurs in the formation of [t] in ‘it’, while the voiceless uvular fricative [ɖȐ      ȏȐ ȋ  substitution for /g/) in the phrase ‘new dog’.
In data 3, a child with developmental verbal dyspraxia is displaying the token variability which is a characteristic feature of the disorder. During repeated productions of ‘plate’, the child produces the consonant cluster /pl/ in its entirety and reduces it to [p]. Word-final /t/ is used on three consecutive productions, but is omitted on the fourth production. There is also variability in the production of the vowel with it realized both as [eᢛ] and as [ᖡ]. In data 4, a woman with multiple sclerosis and acquired dysarthria is engaging in self-repair of her production of ‘questions’. In her first attempt, she uses the glottal stop [ᏆȐveolar fricative /s/ and the voiceless affricate /ᣎ/. These target sounds are correctly realized during her attempt at repair. Finally, in data 5, a child with cleft palate is replacing alveolar and velar plosives in word-initial position with the glottal stop. A glottal stop also replaces /g/ in word-final position in ‘dog’. This child can achieve a complete blockage of the airstream at the glottis, which then stands in substitution of oral plosive articulations where such a blockage is not possible.
4.2. Phonology
Phonology is the study of the sound system of a language. The phoneme is the minimal meaningful sound unit in a language. A central concern of phonology is the patterns of phonemes in a language and how these patterns may be used to convey meaning. These patterns reflect the contrastive function of phonemes. Two sounds function contrastively when the substitution of one by the other changes meaning. There are numerous examples of this contrastive function of phonemes in language. For example, in English the phonemes /p/ and /b/ function contrastively both in word-initial and in word-final positions, e.g., ‘pat’ and ‘bat’; ‘pall’ and ‘ball’; ‘lap’ and ‘lab’; ‘pike’ and ‘bike’. A similar contrastive function is also observed in the case of the phonemes /k/ and /g/ in English, e.g., ‘Kate’ and ‘gate’; ‘cap’ and ‘gap’; ‘pick’ and ‘pig’; ‘lock’ and ‘log’. The use of phonemes to convey meaning in a

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 1-30 13
language can be a struggle for even normally developing children. These children routinely experience reduced intelligibility when this contrastive function of phonemes is not adequately established and, for example, [keᢛt] is used for both ‘Kate’ and ‘gate’.
Phonology is another vital part of the linguistics knowledge of the clinical linguist. Phonological disorders are particularly common in young children – in 60% of preschool children on some accounts (Shriberg, 1994) – and form a large part of the caseload of paediatric speech and language therapists. These disorders may occur in the absence of other involvement such as neurological impairment or craniofacial anomalies. Alternatively, they can be found as one of several areas of language breakdown in children with a range of other conditions including intellectual disability and hearing loss. Apart from children, phonological problems can also occur in adults with aphasia where errors known as phonemic paraphasias may be produced. Examples of phonological problems in children are shown below:
Data 6: Spanish-English-speaking bilingual children (Goldstein & Iglesias, 1996) ‘plate’ /plato/ ՜ [pwato] ‘cross’ /krus/ ՜ [tus] ‘mouse’ /raton/ ՜ [ᖭakon]
Data 7: Dutch-speaking girl with Kabuki make-up syndrome (Van Lierde, Van Borsel, & Van Cauwenberge, 2000) ‘clouds’ /wᖜlkᖠn/ ՜ [wᖜk] ‘boy’ /jᖜăᖠn/ ՜ [ᖜăᖠ] ‘bicycle’ /fits/ ՜ [sis]
Data 8: Children with intellectual disability (Mackay & Hodson, 1982) ‘page’ /peiᣋ/ ՜ [peiᣎ] ‘basket’ /bæskᖠt/ ՜ [ægᖠ] ‘glove’ /glᖴv/ ՜ [glᖴf]
The combined data of these children reveal a wide range of phonological processes, some of which occur more commonly in disordered speech than others. The bilingual children in data 6 exhibit liquid gliding (/pl/ ՜ [pw] in ‘plate’), consonant cluster reduction and velar fronting (/kr/ ՜ [t] in ‘cross’), and backing (/t/ ՜ [k] in ‘mouse’). In data 7, the Dutch-speaking girl with Kabuki make-up syndrome, who also has a submucous cleft palate, exhibits three different phonological processes in her speech. A process called syllable deletion occurs in ‘clouds’ with the omission of the syllable /ᖠn/. Both initial consonant and final consonant deletion are evident in ‘boy’. A process called regressive assimilation occurs in ‘bicycle’ with the speaker anticipating wordfinal /s/ which is used as a substitution for word-initial /f/. The children with intellectual disability in data 8 display some of these same processes. For

14 L. Cummings

example, initial consonant and final consonant deletion occur in ‘basket’. There is also consonant cluster reduction of /sk/ to [g] in ‘basket’. Processes not seen in the other children’s productions are voicing of /k/ to [g] in ‘basket’, and postvocalic devoicing in /ᣋ/ ՜ [ᣎ] of ‘page’ and /v/ ՜ [f] of ‘glove’.

4.3. Morphology
Individual words have their own internal structure. That structure is studied by linguists who work in the field of morphology. Morphology is the study of the morphemes which comprise the internal structure of words. Some words in language are monomorphemic in that they contain a single morpheme. An example is the word ‘daughter’ which cannot be broken down into more basic parts. However, many more words in language are composed of two or more morphemes. The word ‘unhappiness’, for example, contains three morphemes. The root of the word is ‘happi’ onto which are added the prefix – un and the derivational suffix –ness. Other suffixes, which have a grammatical function, are described as inflectional. In the words ‘walks’, ‘playing’, ‘prettiest’ and ‘mended’, the inflectional suffixes –s, -ing, -est, and –ed indicate a third person singular part of the verb, the present participle, the superlative form of an adjective, and the past tense of a verb, respectively. Unlike the roots of these words, which are free or lexical morphemes, inflectional and derivational morphemes are bound morphemes.
Morphological errors are by no means uncommon in children and adults with language disorders. The child with specific language impairment (SLI) can omit inflectional suffixes from nouns and verbs and use such suffixes when they are not required. The adult with aphasia who has reduced expressive language may also omit inflectional morphemes in his spoken output. He may also fail to comprehend morphemes in the spoken utterances of others leading, for example, to a mistaken interpretation of passive voice constructions when the inflectional suffix –ed of the passive participle ‘chased’ is not recognized as such: The man was chased by the dog. There is some evidence that adults with schizophrenia may have morphological deficits including the omission of suffixes. Some of these morphological errors are shown below:

Data 9:

Children with specific language impairment (Schuele & Dykes, 2005; Bliss, McCabe, & Miranda, 1998) (a) ‘it’s long ways to go’ (b) ‘if you just shoot it and it makes a basket not touching the rim or the the box, it’s still a points’ (c) ‘I flied and then I jumped down’

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 1-30 15

Data 10:

Adult with schizophrenia (Chaika, 1982)
‘. . . I am being helped but at the same time that I am being help with the food and medicate the food and medicate and the the food an medicate and the an the ah rest I feel that I still do not have this I still not have the thought pattern and the mental process and the brain wave necessary to open up a page open up the old testament and start to memory it the old te- the old new testament page of the bible . . .’

Data 11:

Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Peets, 2009)
(a) ‘summer summer is my bestest month because you know why Wonderland and swimming!’
(b) ‘. . .they have a machine that will they have a hooks that will pull you back up . . .’

The morphological errors in the above data include the incorrect use and omission of inflectional and derivational suffixes. In data 9, a child with SLI uses the inflectional suffix –s on the nouns ‘way’ and ‘point’ when it is not necessary to do so. The child who utters ‘flied’ has attempted to form the past tense of ‘fly’ by adding the inflectional suffix –ed to the bare infinitive form of the verb. The adult with schizophrenia in data 10 omits inflectional and derivational suffixes. The inflectional suffix –ed is omitted in ‘…I am being help…’. The derivational suffixes –ion and –ize do not appear in ‘medicate’ and ‘to memory’, respectively. (On an alternative interpretation of these morphological errors as grammatical deficits, the client with schizophrenia has selected the verb ‘medicate’ instead of the noun ‘medication’, while the noun ‘memory’ has been used in place of the verb ‘memorize’.) One of the children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in data 11 has used the inflectional suffix –s on what should be the singular noun ‘hook’. The other child has used the inflectional suffix –est, which is used to form the superlative of regular adjectives, on the irregular adjective ‘best’. In effect, the child who uses ‘bestest’ has marked the adjective twice for superlative.

4.4. Syntax
Individual words can combine in various ways to form the grammatical sentences of a language. Syntax is the study of these possible combinations within a language. For example, to form a yes-no interrogative in English, the speaker must invert the subject pronoun and auxiliary verb as in Will you help me with my homework? The syntactic rules of English prohibit the use of the

16 L. Cummings

following combination of words for this interrogative: You me will with my homework help?. Syntactic rules also specify the order of occurrence of the determiners in a noun phrase so that although She loved her two elderly aunts is a syntactically acceptable sentence in English, the combination She loved two her elderly aunts is definitely not. On one prominent approach to syntax – generative grammar – syntactic rules specify the types of movements that must occur between the deep and surface structure of a sentence in order to arrive at a grammatical sentence of the language. These rules are responsible for generating wh-interrogatives (e.g., What car are you driving?), and passive voice constructions (e.g., The dog was kicked by the boy) amongst other structures.
Syntax is a particularly important aspect of the clinical linguist’s knowledge as grammatical impairments are commonly observed in children and adults with language disorders. Children with specific language impairment omit auxiliary verbs, use object pronouns in the place of subject pronouns, and use the wrong form for lexical verbs in sentences. Interrogative forms may be immature and grammatical classes such as prepositions may be omitted altogether. Many of these same deviant and immature grammatical features can also be seen in children with intellectual disability often in the presence of a syndrome. Adults with agrammatic aphasia display significant syntactic impairment. Often, content words such as nouns, verbs and adjectives are the only grammatical categories to be retained with function words such as prepositions and articles omitted altogether. The resulting spoken output has the appearance of a telegram (hence, the use of the term ‘agrammatic’ to describe this type of aphasia). Adults with schizophrenia can often exhibit impaired clause structure. Some of these syntactic deficits are shown below:

Data 12:

Children with expressive SLI (Moore, 2001) (a) ‘Why he fall in the car’? (b) ‘He eating’ (c) ‘Her’s painting a flower’

Data 13:

Boy (‘JB’) with FG syndrome and agenesis of the corpus callosum (McCardle & Wilson, 1993) (a) ‘I go sleep uncle room, I sleep uncle bed’ (54 months) (b) ‘I go fight doggie’ (67 months)

Data 14:

Man called Roy who is 7 years post-left hemisphere CVA (Beeke, Wilkinson, & Maxim, 2007)
‘um … so s- er skiing … er waterskiing … yeh uh Greenbridge … yeah? uh Kent … uh … uh … four of them … uuuhh …

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 1-30 17
blokes y’know … uh … uhhh … boat … and … anyway … sort of … waterskiing … and strange! … sort of … and then … ur … bang! [mimes falling over] … funny … and all of a sudden … bang’
The child with expressive SLI in part (a) of data 12 makes use of an immature interrogative form, in which ‘why’ is simply placed at the start of a statement. No auxiliary verb is present and so no inversion of the type required to form a question has been attempted. The child with SLI in (b) of data 12 has omitted the auxiliary verb ‘is’. In (c), the child has succeeded in including an auxiliary verb. However, it occurs alongside the object pronoun ‘her’ rather than the subject pronoun ‘she’. The boy with FG syndrome in data 13 displays a number of grammatical errors. He is unable to use the genitive form (’s) so that ‘uncle’s room’ is produced as ‘uncle room’. Locative prepositions are omitted in ‘I go sleep [in] uncle room, I sleep [in] uncle bed’. Determiners are omitted in noun phrases, e.g., ‘[my] uncle room’, ‘[the] doggie’. JB uses verbs in constructions such as ‘go sleep’ and ‘go fight’ in which either ‘and’ or ‘to’ is omitted. Roy’s verbal output in data 14 displays agrammatism. Nouns (e.g., Kent, blokes, boat) and adjectives (e.g., strange, funny, sudden) are retained in Roy’s verbal output. Articles (definite and indefinite) and pronouns are completely omitted. Prepositions (with the exception of ‘of’), conjunctions (with the exception of ‘and’) and verbs (with the exception of ‘waterskiing’) are not present.
4.5. Semantics
Semantics is the branch of linguistics that studies word and sentence meaning. The notions of sense and reference are integral to the study of language meaning. The concept of sense captures language-internal meaning and is characterized in terms of lexical relations between the words of a language. These relations include synonymy (words with same or similar meanings), hyponymy (the relation of inclusion between words), meronymy (a part-whole relation between words), polysemy (a word which has two or more related senses), homonymy (a word which has two or more unrelated senses) and antonymy (the relation of opposition between words). Reference is the basis of language-external meaning. The words in a language can refer to individuals and objects (so-called ‘referents’) or to sets of properties (socalled ‘extensions’). Semanticists may also subscribe to different theoretical approaches to the study of language meaning. One such approach is componential analysis in which the meaning of words is analysed in terms of semantic components or primitives. The meaning of the word ‘woman’, for example, consists in the three primitives [HUMAN] [FEMALE] and [ADULT].

18 L. Cummings

With its rich array of concepts and theories, semantics is an important branch of linguistic study for the clinical linguist. Semantic deficits are a common feature of children and adults with language disorders. Children with specific language impairment can display naming errors with many errors related to the target word (e.g., the use of ‘shoe’ for foot). The child with intellectual disability may have difficulty grouping words according to semantic fields such as fruit and transport. Many of the semantic paraphasias produced by adults with aphasia can be characterized in terms of lexical relations such as hyponymy and antonymy. Some of the lexical substitutions that aphasic clients make can be analysed in terms of components or primitives. For example, the client who utters ‘heart’ in place of the word ‘love’ is clearly substituting an abstract term with a concrete one. Semantic associations are the basis of many instances of bizarre language use in adults with schizophrenia. The disruption of semantic representations in the lexicon of the client with dementia leads to word-finding problems and the use of incorrect lexemes. Some of these semantic errors are demonstrated in the data below:

Data 15:

Child (‘JB’) with FG syndrome and callosal agenesis (McCardle & Wilson, 1993) (a) E: ‘Tell me about your dog.’ JB: ‘It go woof woof.’ (b) ‘Daddy have a pretty’ (when asked to name a watch) (c) ‘fire, burns’ (when asked to name a match)

Data 16:

74-year-old woman (‘JT’) with Wernicke’s aphasia

(Buckingham & Rekart, 1979)

(d) HWB: ‘It’s hot outside.’ JT: ‘It wasn’t cold for me.’

(e) ‘I would be able to hear you better with than than this eye…’

(f) ‘They’re too big! They’re too big! They gotta make bigger for

my feet…my shoes are little aren’t big enough!’

(g) ‘Well, that’s the fingers…’ (when asked to name knuckles)

Data 17:

Confrontation naming in subjects with chronic schizophrenia (Barr, Bilder, Goldberg, Kaplan, & Mukherjee, 1989) (h) cactus: ‘the thing you find in Mexico’ (i) abacus: ‘math beads, math scale’ (j) wreath: ‘Christman rath…no, wreath’ (k) telescope: ‘microscope, harmonica, molasses…telescope’

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 1-30 19
The child with FG syndrome in data 15 displays lexical immaturity when he uses the onomatopoeic form ‘woof woof’ instead of the verb ‘bark’. He also exhibits word-finding problems as indicated by his use of circumlocutions when asked to name a watch and a match. In the absence of being able to produce the names of these items, the child begins to talk (‘locution’) around (‘circum’) them. The adult with Wernicke’s aphasia in data 16 uses the gradable antonym ‘cold’ in place of the target word ‘hot’ in (d). Another gradable antonym ‘big’ is used in (f) in place of the target word ‘small’. In (e), the target word ‘ear’ is replaced by the word ‘eye’ from the same semantic field of body parts. In (g), speaker JT has produced the word ‘fingers’ in place of the target word ‘knuckles’. These words are related through the lexical relation of meronymy (i.e., ‘knuckles’ is a meronym of ‘fingers’).
The subjects with chronic schizophrenia in data 17 are displaying semantic deficits during confrontation naming. In (h) and (i), these clients are producing circumlocutions in place of the target words ‘cactus’ and ‘abacus’, respectively. In (j), the word ‘Christman’ (for Christmas) is produced en route to the target word ‘wreath’ because of the close semantic association between these words (wreaths are typically displayed at Christmas). Finally in (k), the speaker produces ‘microscope’ for ‘telescope’ because of a semantic association between these words which is based on their similarity of function, i.e., magnifying objects. Of course, a phonemic similarity between the uttered word and target word cannot be ruled out as a basis for this naming error also.
4.6. Pragmatics
Many linguistic utterances convey meaning beyond their truth-conditional or semantic content. For example, the speaker who utters in front of a disruptive 5-year-old ‘What a delightful child!’ is clearly intending to make his listener aware of his ironic intent. That the speaker believes that the child is anything but delightful is not indicated by the utterance alone—in fact, the utterance conveys that the child is delightful—but by the utterance in combination with features of context, in particular, the presence of a disruptive child. Pragmatics is the branch of linguistics that studies the type of language meaning in context illustrated by this example. As well as explaining how utterances which say one thing may be taken to implicate something altogether different, pragmatics is also interested in how one and the same utterance can serve different functions in different contexts. So the utterance ‘There is a bull in the field’ may have an informative function in one context and function as a warning in another context. Other concepts of significance to pragmatics are presupposition (meanings which are taken for granted or assumed between speaker and hearer), deixis (terms such as ‘here’ and ‘today’ which relate to the spatiotemporal context of an utterance),

20 L. Cummings
politeness, and aspects of conversational interaction such as turn-taking and topic management.
Pragmatic disorders may occur alongside impairments of structural language (e.g., syntax, semantics) or in isolation from structural language deficits. These disorders have been examined in depth in Cummings (2009, 2012, 2014). They include the failure of children with an autism spectrum disorder to recover the implicature of a speaker’s utterances, to use deictic expressions appropriately, and to introduce topics into a conversation which will be of interest to the hearer. Adults who sustain right-hemisphere damage may interpret the non-literal utterances used to express metaphors and idioms in literal, concrete ways. Clients with schizophrenia may produce impolite utterances. Additionally, failure on the part of these clients to adhere to Gricean maxims of relation, quantity and manner may lead to the production of tangential, verbose or under-informative, and illogical utterances, respectively. Adults who sustain a traumatic brain injury may display poor topic management skills or exchange turns ineffectively with others during conversation. Some of these pragmatic problems are evident in the data below:
Data 18: Boy (‘R’), aged 9;3 years, with specific language impairment (Bliss, et al., 1998) E: Two weeks ago I had to go to the hospital to have some x-rays taken. Have you ever been to the hospital? R: Yeah, I had a X-ray because they they’re checking on my leg and I was scared that I was going up there and they gave me a balloon and I went to um Toys ‘R Us and gave me a toy but I never . . . . .I uh I just broke my leg and I just fall down on my bike because I got hurt and my Band-Aids on me. . . . put their off and I jumped out of my bike and I . . . I flied and then I jumped down. E: You jumped down? R: Uhuh, on the grass. . . . and I um our grandma um she died. She um she was getting older. Our grandma and she died and the uh funeral . . . My ma and dad went to the funeral and then Aunt Cindy was there too and we uh they um uh everybody was sad that um uh that died. . . .and on my birthday I went on my bike and I uh um . . . . I just jump on my bike and I just balance on my . . . . and I did it with uh I did do it with only my hands. I didn’t do it without my hands and I uh um one hand too.
Data 19: The following extract is taken from Abusamra, Côté, Joanette, & Ferreres (2009: 77-78). It is a dialogue between an examiner (E)

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 1-30 21
and a male patient (P) with right-hemisphere damage. The patient has been asked to explain the meaning of one of the metaphors from the MEC protocol (Joanette, Ska, & Côté, 2004). E: What does this phrase mean: My friend’s mother-in-law is a
witch? P: Let’s change also one word: My son-in-law’s mother-in-law is a
witch? E: And so what does it mean? P: I know she is a person who hasn’t had a pleasant life, throughout
her marriage. That…that she’s about to be separated from her husband; I’m referring to the mother-in-law of my son-in-law (ha, ha, ha) E: OK it’s not important – it’s the same. P: Certainly! The mother-in-law of my son-in-law. The mother-inlaw of my son-in-law is a witch! E: What does being a witch mean? P: Because the woman is separated, because all her life she has criticized her husband for the way he is; only seen in his defects, who has kept his daughter all her life under a glass bell and she’s now a poor lady because she can’t find the fiancé her mother would like. E: So what does witch mean, then? P: What does it specifically mean? It means being tied down to religious sects, to religions, to umbanda…who knows, there are so many. E: So therefore, “The mother-in-law of my son-in-law is a witch”. Does it mean the mother-in-law of my friend practices black magic? And the mother-in-law of my friend has many brooms and she is also a bad person an rude? P: It’s absolutely clear. My friend’s mother-in-law has many brooms…no! My friend’s mother-in-law practices black magic.
Data 20: Client with schizophrenia, responding to question from doctor (Thomas, 1997) ‘Then I left San Francisco and moved to…where did you get that tie? It looks like it’s left over from the 1950s. I like the warm weather in San Diego. Is that a conch shell on your desk? Have you ever gone scuba diving?’
These extracts of data reveal a range of pragmatic disorders commonly seen in clinical practice. The boy with SLI in data 18 displays poor topic

management skills. He fails to develop a topic to any extent before leaving it for another topic and then eventually returning to the original topic. For example, the topics in R’s first extended turn can be represented as follows: leg – toys – leg – bike. In R’s second extended turn, his topic structure appears as follows: bike accident – death of grandmother – funeral – bike. In data 19, P’s interpretation of the metaphor ‘…is a witch’ is concrete and literal in nature. In elaborating the meaning of this metaphor, P refers only to the conventional attributes of witches which are contained in the semantic meaning of the word ‘witch’, e.g., inclusion in religious sects, the practice of black magic. In data 20, the client with schizophrenia displays a failure of relevance. Initially, this client appears to make a relevant response to the doctor’s question about how he came to be living in a particular city in the US. However, his response soon veers off topic into complete irrelevance. There is an additional pragmatic anomaly in that comments about the doctor’s tie breach the politeness constraints that normally characterize medical interactions between doctors and their clients.
4.7. Discourse
Language is more than the study of sentences and their component parts. Many significant features of language can only be revealed by examining how sentences interrelate to other sentences within larger extracts of discourse. Discourse is now included as standard as a branch of study in linguistics. Evidence of this is the proliferation of studies in linguistics that examine discourse processes in specific contexts (e.g., media discourse, institutional and professional discourse). Linguists who examine discourse are interested in how cohesion is achieved across extended extracts of language. For example, sentences or utterances in narrative discourse may be linked through anaphoric reference (e.g., Sally bought a new dress. It was the one with the blue stripes), the use of collocation (e.g., Jack climbed up the old oak in the garden. The tree gave him the best vantage point), and lexical reiteration (e.g., The explorer began his ascent of the mountain. The climb was his most difficult to date). A narrative may contain many cohesive links, but may still not exhibit discourse coherence if it fails to develop a theme or omits information that is essential to the understanding of a text. So the narrator who states that Sally bought a new dress without also stating the purpose for which the dress was purchased (e.g., to attend a friend’s birthday party) may well have produced a cohesive narrative but will not have achieved a coherent one.
Discourse can be an area of considerable impairment in children and adults with language disorders. The use of referring expressions by children and adults with autism spectrum disorders is often disrupted, principally on account of their difficulties with theory of mind (see Cummings (2013c,

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 1-30 23
2013d) for discussion). The child who cannot attribute mental states to the minds of others often fails to appreciate the listener’s absence of referents for the terms he uses in a narrative or other extract of language. The child or adult who sustains a traumatic brain injury can display many discourse problems, often in the context of intact structural language skills. For example, discourse may be repetitive and under-informative, as no new information is presented during the repetitions produced by the speaker. Alternatively, discourse can digress into copious, irrelevant detail with the result that it can appear over-informative. Egocentricity is often a feature of the narrative discourse produced by adults with right-hemisphere damage and schizophrenia. Typically, this takes the form of the narration of personal experiences which are not of interest to the listener and are irrelevant to the goals and purpose of a narrative. Some of these discourse problems are illustrated by the data below:
Data 21: 16-year-old boy (‘J’) with autism in conversation with examiner (Bliss, et al., 1998) E: My sister was on a swing and she fell off and broke her wrist. Have you ever broken your arm? J: Yeah. E: What happened? J: I broke the wrist on his back. I got throat and the stomach and that boy says, “I got the stomach ache” and the man. . . . and they got. . . . I said, “I hurt my wrist and umm the man is umm he’s a person. The man is umm he’s a and the man is umm. . . . He got arrested and umm the man is got a chest with a body over and the man is uh person of the man of God.
Data 22: Girl, aged 7 years 4 months, with traumatic brain injury. She was asked to recount an occasion when she was stung by a bee (Biddle, McCabe, & Bliss, 1996) ‘Ummm, I, once, there was a, we went. There was a for. There was this umm fort. A tree fell down. And there was dirt, all kinds of stuff there. It was our fort. And one day, I have a friend named Jude. She’s umm grown up. She has a kid. She has a cat named Gus, a kitten. It’s so cute. But once, when she didn’t have that kitten, one day, me, my brother, my cousin Matt, and her, and my dad, and one of his friends, went into the woods to see the fort, to show her. And we went up there. I stepped on a bee’s nest. And they chased us all the way back. And I got stung and my cousin Matt got stung in one of the private parts. And umm I had a bite right here (points), right

24 L. Cummings
here (points), right there (points), and umm one on my cheek. And right here. And when I umm went over, when we got back to my friend Jude’s house, in her bathroom she had this clean kind of stuff. And I put it on me. She put it one me right here (points). But umm, I had to go to the bathroom to put it on, you know. It hurt! And my brother Jason he got stung once. He got stung I think three right here (points). I remember where I got stung, but I don’t remember where Jason got stung. My friend Jude didn’t even get stung. She ran so fast that she didn’t even get stung. The bees chased us and I looked back. And there was one right in front of my face. That’s when I got stung here (points). There was like two hanging around my legs. I was running and trying to get them off me. They both went, “Bzzzzz”. It hurt! I was crying my head off.’
Data 23: This extract was produced by a schizophrenic client who was studied by Chaika and Lambe (1989). It followed a viewing of a short video story called the Ice Cream Story. In this story, a young girl is refused her request for ice cream from her mother because it is close to supper time. However, when her father enters the house, the young girl approaches him with the same request and he gives her money from his trouser pocket. The young girl takes the money to the store and uses it to buy a very large doubledecker cone. ‘I was watching a film of a little girl and um s bring back memories of things that happened to uh people around me that affected me during the time when I was living in that area and she just went to the store for a candy bar and by the time ooh of course her brother who was supposed to be watching wasn’t paying much attention he was blamed for and I didn’t think that was fair the way the way they did that either, so that’s why I’m kinda like asking could we just get together for one big party or something ezz it hey if it we’d all in which is in not they’ve been here, so why you jis now discovering it?’.
The boy in data 21 introduces several referring expressions in the absence of any referents for these expressions. They include ‘his back’ (whose back?), ‘that boy’ (what boy?), ‘the man’ (what man?) and ‘they got’ (who got?). This problem with referring expressions is symptomatic of the theory of mind problems which occur in autism. To the extent that this boy is unable to attribute mental states to the mind of the examiner in the exchange, he will also be unable to determine if the examiner has clear referents for the expressions which he introduces into his spoken discourse. Unlike the boy

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 1-30 25
with autism, the girl with traumatic brain injury in data 22 is able to take her listener’s state of knowledge into account as she develops her narrative. This is suggested by several features of her spoken discourse. She explicitly introduces characters and agents into the narrative and then refers to them through pronominal reference (e.g., ‘She has a cat named Gus, a kitten. It’s so cute’). Through doing so, she ensures that the listener can track the various protagonists in the story. The girl also ensures that her listener knows the referents of adverbs such as ‘here’ and ‘there’ by pointing to specific body parts. Finally, she expends considerable effort introducing the familial and other relationships she has with each of the characters in the story (e.g., my cousin Matt, my brother Jason, my friend Jude). Some of these are stated on more than one occasion during the narrative. This indicates an attempt to give the listener some background knowledge within which to process the details of the narrative.
Alongside certain skills in narrative construction, the girl in data 22 also displays a number of discourse problems. Some of the referring expressions she uses lack clear referents (e.g., ‘all kinds of stuff there’). There is misuse of temporal expressions which normally contribute to the development of a narrative (e.g., ‘And one day, I have a friend named Jude’). The temporal expression ‘one day’ is incongruent with the introduction of a friend into the narrative. There are several instances of repetition and topic digression. For example, the girl gives a detailed account of where she was bitten, then talks about the medical assistance she received at her friend’s house, and returns to discuss further where she was stung. She also introduces the fort, then leaves it to talk about a tree and dirt, and then returns to the fort. Additionally, certain Gricean maxims are compromised including quantity (there is an excessively detailed explanation of where each of her friends was stung), relation (she veers off topic and begins to talk about irrelevant points such as her friend’s kitten) and manner (the account of the medication she received at her friend’s house is confusing, ambiguous and contradictory).
The speaker with schizophrenia in data 23 also displays strengths and weaknesses in the production of narrative discourse. This speaker is able to achieve lexical cohesion through the use of anaphoric reference (e.g., ‘little girl … she just went to the store …’ and ‘her brother … he was blamed …’). The use of an introduction to the story (i.e., ‘I was watching a film of a little girl …’) also reveals an appreciation of narrative structure on the part of this client. However, the narrative is highly egocentric in places with the speaker relating personal experiences which are unrelated to the story he is narrating. Egocentric discourse emerges early in the extract with ‘bring back memories of things that happened to uh people around me that affected me during the time when I was living in that area …’. It is particularly difficult to follow this egocentric discourse because the speaker is using a range of expressions

26 L. Cummings
which do not relate to the ice cream story and for which no clear referent can be identified (e.g., ‘… I was living in that area …’ and ‘… I’m kinda like asking could we just get together ...’). However, even this egocentric discourse displays adequate cohesion, as indicated by the underlined words in the following extract: ‘bring back memories of things that happened to uh people around me that affected me during the time when I was living in that area …’.
5. Summary
It has been argued in this paper that clinical linguistics has been somewhat overlooked as a field of linguistic study, particularly in comparison to disciplines such as syntax and semantics. This paper has attempted to address the relative neglect of clinical linguistics by workers in traditionally dominant branches of language study by demonstrating the central role played by linguistics in the characterization and analysis of language and communication disorders. From phonetics, phonology and morphology to syntax, semantics, pragmatics and discourse, each branch of linguistic study has been shown to contribute important insights to the understanding of language disorders. To the extent that it is not even possible to describe these disorders in the absence of linguistic concepts and frameworks, some reconsideration of the place of clinical linguistics within language study in general must surely now be in order. As its name suggests, clinical linguistics is the clinical application of the same concepts and methods which are part of the working knowledge of all linguists. To treat it otherwise is to misrepresent the essential nature of this important linguistic discipline.
This paper has undertaken to introduce the reader to clinical linguistics. The field has been defined and rooted in its wider clinical context. This context includes the clinicians who assess and treat clients with language and communication disorders and the profession to which they belong. Also, the human communication cycle has been examined in its entirety, from its outset in the generation of a communicative intention by a speaker to its termination in the recovery of that intention by a hearer. Each main category of language and communication disorder has been characterized as a point of breakdown in this complex cycle of cognitive and linguistic processing. The specific role of each linguistic discipline in understanding these disorders has been examined and illustrated through the use of data from clinical subjects. However, what this paper did not explore was the contribution of theoretical developments in linguistics to the study of language disorders. Nor did it consider the ways in which language disorders can contribute to theoretical developments in linguistics and beyond. These issues will be topics of discussion in a companion article in IJLS entitled “Clinical linguistics: State of the art.”

The language of money: How verbal and visual metonymy shapes public opinion about financial events
Theresa CATALANO, University of Nebraska-Lincoln, USA Linda R. WAUGH, University of Arizona, USA
“Everything means something,” Lyra said, “we just have to find out how to read it.” (from Lyra’s Oxford by Philip Pullman)
Much recent work on metonymy has concentrated on its definition, properties and functions (Benczes, Barcelona & Ruiz de Mendoza Ibáñez, 2011) but few studies have examined the combination of verbal and visual metonymy or the benefits of multimodal metonymical analysis in issues of social justice. In this paper eleven news articles regarding issues in financial discourse such as the financial crisis, fiscal cliff, underwater homeowners and entitlements are examined visually and verbally from a variety of online newspaper sources. Results reveal intricate visual and verbal metonymies such as EFFECT FOR CAUSE, RESULT FOR ACTION, INSTITUTION FOR PERSON, DEFINING PROPERTY FOR CATEGORY and BODY PART FOR ACTION that aid in hiding or highlighting events and act as ideology carriers that are difficult to detect. The unique contribution of this article lies not only in the exposure of linguistic/non-linguistic strategies used to mitigate the role of those responsible for the financial crisis, or to shape public opinion on a particular policy or issue, but also in the attention it gives to metonymy’s role (in text and image) in the positive representation of corporate America which, we will argue, has resulted in few repercussions for the financial sector.

become ingrained in public discourse and resembles more closely that of a soap opera than a news report. The language of the financial sector has infiltrated daily life through multiple sources of media discourse/social networks, and greatly influences how the public feels about financial, political or government issues.
One of the subtlest linguistic strategies that influences public opinion is the use of metonymy. Metonymy can be defined as a stand-for relationship in which something stands for something else it is related to or associated with. Metonymy has traditionally been overshadowed by the study of metaphor and has sometimes been thought of as a sub-category of metaphor (Genette, 1980; Levin, 1977; Searle, 1979), yet others argue that it is a very different type (starting with Jakobson 1956, [see also Barcelona, 2011; Benczes, 2011; Gibbs, 1994, 1999; Kovecses, 2006]) and thus there is increasing focus on its rhetorical force in discourse.
For the purposes of this paper, ‘discourse’ is language in real contexts of use (Machin & Mayr, 2012, p. 20) and the broader ideas communicated by a text can be referred to as ‘discourses’ (Fairclough, 2000; van Dijk, 1993; Wodak, 2001). These discourses can be thought of as models of the world (as Foucault, 1981 characterizes them). More and more politicians, bankers, Wall Street executives and those involved in the world of finance have discovered the value of metonymy in discourse (although they may not refer to it as such or even know the word, much less its conceptual definition) in swaying public opinion in their favor. At the same time, others involved in making policy decisions and regulations affecting the financial sector or those advocating for change and a more equitable system often use the same terms adopted by those coming from the opposite ideological frame, and thus are not able to get their message across to the public effectively (e.g., the use of the term entitlements to be discussed later in this paper) (Lakoff & Wehling, 2012, p. 43). Thus they are making use of the discourse that surrounds us (in Foucault’s sense of the term) because they see how well it works, all the while not knowing what “it” is. Therefore, the need is more pressing than ever to understand the role of metonymy (and its combinations with metaphor) in constructing and reproducing dominant discourses in order to grasp when and how manipulation is occurring. Because financial issues are often complex and difficult to understand for the layperson, the analysis of this type of language becomes even more an issue of social justice. That is, it is a right and a duty of linguists and discourse analysts like ourselves to break down the discourse and conceptual frames of metonymies in financial discourse in order to reveal the way they influence thought.
While much has been written about the language of financial events such as the current financial crisis, little has been written about the interaction of

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 31-60 33
visual and verbal metonymy in the texts and their relationship to public opinion about these issues. Ever present in today’s media discourse is the use of multiple modes of delivery such as video, sound and image. Thus, the way we communicate is seldom by one mode (language), instead, “. . . it is done simultaneously through a number of modes—multimodally, by combinations of the visual, sound, language, etc. . . . .” (Kress & van Leeuwen, 1996). Hence there is an increasing need for multimodal analysis of metonymy in order to understand its full effects. Along these lines, the present study aims to investigate the role of metonymy in shaping public opinion about financial events in the US and Europe in both verbal and visual elements of media discourse.
2. Background 2.1. How metonymy works in text and image
“What people say and how they act depends on what they think” (Lakoff & Wehling, 2012, p. 1). Language makes use of these deep modes of thought but like most of thought, use of metonymy is largely unconscious, and people are not necessarily aware of the thought processes brought about by the language they use. Unless these processes are brought to the surface, people can be easily manipulated by metonymies (frequent in the political realm) and remain blissfully unaware of how they have been influenced.
Defining metonymy is no simple task (for example, Benczes, Barcelona and Ruiz de Mendoza Ibáñez, (2011) have written an entire book on defining metonymy). However, most would agree that metonymy is a relationship in which one element stands for another element that it is closely related to or associated with in order to direct attention to it (or away from something else) (Kövecses, 2006). Metaphor and metonymy are often difficult to distinguish from each other, and recent research has shown that the two quite commonly interact in linguistic expressions, thus complicating the analysis (Benczes, 2011, p. 203). In Cognitive Linguistics (CL), metaphors are considered to be a conceptual mapping from one semantic source domain (the more concrete and more directly related to human, including bodily experience) to a different semantic target domain that is more abstract and ȋÝǡʹͲͲ͸ȌǤ  that metonymy is an asymmetrical mapping in which the target is understood from the perspective of the source (Barcelona, 2011). One example from this paper is that of underwater mortgages (see Section 4.3) where owing money on a house is understood from the perspective of a boat sinking, triggering a complex interaction between the metonymy of HOME FOR BOAT and FINANCIAL INSECURITY IS DOWN. Another simple way to understand the distinction between metaphor and metonymy is to think of the relationship between the source and target domains in metaphor as an “IS A” type,

34 T. Catalano & L. R. Waugh

whereas in metonymy it is a “STANDS FOR” relationship. Thus in the above example, FINANCIAL INSECURITY IS DOWN (metaphor) and the HOME STANDS FOR the BOAT (metonymy) (Herrero-Ruiz, 2011, p. 168).

Metaphor and metonymy are indispensable cognitive tools for making abstract, complex and elusive concepts more accessible to the general public and sometimes even ȋ
«-Erdelij© Ƭ©, 2011, p. 149). However, without ignoring the relationship to metaphor, the present paper will focus on metonymy and its uses in financial discourse. In the case of matters relating to financial events and government budgets, metonymy is often used with the clear intention of creating the pragmatic effects of hiding less favorable elements in the target concept (with the use of euphemism, and other devices such as the deletion of important and even problematic elements) or exposing them (with the use of dysphemism—the opposite of euphemism), according to the ideological viewpoint of the author/speaker (ibid, p. 148; Portero Muñoz, 2011, p. 153). This link between language and ideology cannot be overlooked, and CL is an efficient tool used to decode and deconstruct exactly how the ideologies are being put forth subtly and covertly in online news sources such as in this study.

Like metaphor, metonymy occurs not only in verbal discourse, but also in visual text, and can be used for the similar purpose of hiding or highlighting. What is also interesting is the way that visual elements can interact with verbal elements in multimodal texts, by elaborating, illustrating or contrasting with the verbal elements. The following examples demonstrate the use of metonymy and how it interacts with text:

p. 138) and helps to establish that Madoff is “one of us” and conveys a covert positive presentation of this man, although he was convicted of a serious crime that had very harmful effects on society. In Photo 2, Lloyd Blankfein (CEO of Goldman Sachs) is shown3 testifying for the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in defense of charges of fraud:

extends this meaning. That is, because the photo is in the context of a

discussion of the court hearing about the case of securities’ fraud against

Goldman Sachs, we know that the persons on the other side of the pointed

finger are the government lawyers (working for the SEC). Therefore, the

underlying message of the photo is not that Lloyd Blankfein or Goldman Sachs

is to blame, but instead, the recipient, metonymically represented by the

pointed finger, is to blame.

As illustrated by the above examples, metonymy in image plays an equally important role in (re)producing ideologies but is often harder to detect and easier to deny as subjective because it is accomplished through suggestion or connotation and by appealing to barely conscious, half-forgotten knowledge (Berger, 1972; van Leeuwen, 2008). Thus, if images seem to allude to things and never say them explicitly, it is important to make these allusions explicit (van Leeuwen, 2008). Metonymy in image can have varying roles such as extending the meaning of the text by adding new and different meanings to complete the message (as in the above photographs) or elaborating on the text’s meaning (Kress & van Leeuwen, 1996). Consequently, the “visual component of a text is an independently organized and structured message, connected with the verbal text, but in no way dependent on it—and similarly

the other way around” (ibid, p. 19). For this reason, the present paper has chosen a multimodal analysis of metonymy, which will allow a more holistic view of how the different elements in the text interact and affect the message that is being communicated to the readers.
2.2. Research on metonymy and language of finance
There is a large body of recent multidisciplinary research that focuses on the language of the financial crisis and issues of government spending and finance (Haase, 2010; Lakoff & Wehling, 2012; Llopis & Rea Rizzo, 2010; López & Llopis, 2010; Malhotra & Margalit, 2010; Portero Muñoz, 2011; Riad & Vaara, 2011, to name a few). Three studies that look at metonymy or metaphor and metonymy (sometimes not referred to explicitly as such) in financial and political discourse have been particularly important for this work in general, and thus they will be discussed here before going on to the analysis. The first study (Riad & Vaara, 2011), focuses on use of metonymy in international mergers and acquisitions (M&As), and in particular examines the way metonymy and metaphor act as central linguistic resources through which national cultural identities and differences are reproduced in media accounts of international M&As. Findings also show that metonymy (in particular, nation metonyms such as “China”) contributes to the construction of emotive frames, stereotypes, ideological differences, and threats, and combines with metaphor to construct cultural differences.
A different study by Portero Muñoz (2011) investigates the language of the global financial crisis and how noun-noun sequences worked with metonymy and metaphor to mask unpleasant facts. In particular, she demonstrates how noun-noun euphemisms use contextual hints and activate conceptual metaphors and/or metonymies designed to make the financial crisis appear less dangerous/dire. Some of the most common euphemisms and their corresponding categories of metonymies found in the discourse about the crisis include ACTION FOR RESULT (e.g., currency adjustment, budget restructuring), RESULT FOR ACTION (e.g., career change, resource reallocation) and EFFECT FOR CAUSE (e.g., employment crisis, employment gap). This article served as an important model for the classification of conceptual metonymies related to financial discourse (as seen in Tables 2-3 on page 54-55).
In addition to the above studies, we have been inspired by the latest addition to a large body of work by George Lakoff (Lakoff & Wehling, 2012), on the use of metaphor and metonymy in political discourse. In The Little Blue Book, the authors show how language use leads to different ways of understanding political issues and how to frame progressive arguments. Although they never mention metonymy specifically (and barely mention metaphor), this book is actually all about the use of metonymy. According to the authors, “Words

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 31-60 37
mean things. They are defined by conceptual frames. In politics, those frames are morally based . . . . To discuss political language is to discuss morality and politics” (p. 9). The authors then go on to explain the important concept of cascades—networks of neurons that link brain circuits, all of which must be activated at once to produce a given understanding. The conceptual structure of political cascades is hierarchical (starting at the bottom and going up) as such:
Moral values framing General frames exemplifying those values Specific frames using those values Specific issues
When a specific issue is discussed, all the frames and values higher up in the hierarchy are also activated and therefore language use (such as metonymies) triggers cascades (ibid, p. 29). Thus, “any discussion of a specific issue activates the entire cascade, strengthening all parts of the cascade in the brains of those hearing the arguments for the specific issue” (p. 29). This is why often just explaining the facts of an issue does not work to persuade someone, because they understand the words in terms of moral values and neural logic, not logical arguments in the mathematical sense. Another important concept in the book is the idea that words such as “freedom”, “equality”, ”justice” and “fairness” can mean different things for people coming from different moral values frames, and that using an opponent’s language or repeating political myths or lies sets the frame for discussion, and is equivalent to “shooting yourself in the foot” (p. 40). Hence, metonymies are often used unconsciously by politicians/journalist on all sides of issues, often to the detriment of the writer/speaker because they activate the wrong frames and thus result in an understanding that does not persuade the reader/listener to agree with them. A final importance of this practical guide is that it takes common metonymies used in financial and government discourse such as entitlements, benefits, tax relief, free market, safety net, health care, and debt ceiling and breaks them down as to how they work metonymically and metaphorically in cascades while giving alternative lexical choices to activate progressive frames. For example, if a politician says that the government should require health care to cover birth control pills, this activates the specific frame (government should assure affordable health care for all, including medications), the general frame (the government should provide resources to protect everyone equally) and the moral values (democracy requires all citizens to care for each other) (Lakoff & Wehling, 2012). Mentioning that we should not require health care to cover birth control pills would activate different cascades. These terms and their alternative suggestions were helpful in understanding the language in the

38 T. Catalano & L. R. Waugh
texts examined for this analysis as well as their use in shaping the public’s opinion.
3. Method
Selection of articles for analysis was a two-part procedure. First, the authors identified financial topics (or topics related to political issues involving government budgets) frequently used in public discourse in the US or Europe by conducting a Google search with terms such as ‘financial’, ‘crisis’, ‘taxes’, ‘debt’, ’benefits’, ‘health care’, ‘fiscal’. From this search a list of terms that appeared frequently was compiled including ‘financial crisis’, ‘fiscal cliff’, ‘underwater mortgages’ and ‘entitlements’. A second Google search was then carried out in order to identify articles from each topic, resulting in a purposeful sampling of eleven texts. Criteria for selection of articles included the following:
1) Topic (such as financial crisis) must be main argument of text. 2) Topic must be mentioned at least three times during the text. 3) Article must contain at least one image or graphic. 4) Article must contain at least 350 words.4 5) Article must have been written between the years 2011-2013.5
The resulting articles came from various online sources such as Wall Street Journal, Washington Post, New York Times, Los Angeles Times and US News (to view the articles, see p. 59). Next, a corpus analysis (using Antconc 3.2) was conducted to identify key metonymies related to the topic. Because the authors were already aware of terms that are frequently used to discuss these topics (and preliminary searches confirmed this), the analysis concentrated on finding the terms and showing in detail how the different types of metonymy work in context. Thus, after the search for metonymies was completed, a second manual search was carried out with a close reading of the contexts of the articles, in order to understand which terms were being used to refer to the topics in various contexts. Once these were determined, the authors selected examples from each topic (and from different texts) to illustrate how the metonymies were being used in both image and text, with the goal of classifying the underlying conceptual metonymies and their interacting metaphors (if there were any). The following analysis of data is organized by financial topic/theme. For a summary of the types of metonymies found in the discourse see Tables 2-3 on pages 54-55.
4 This minimum word limit was imposed in order to ensure enough context to analyze the meaning.
5 This time frame was imposed in order to keep articles within a similar political and economic context.

4. Results and discussion
4.1. Financial crisis
Analysis of discourse discussing the financial crisis of the US and its equivalent in Europe revealed much use of conceptual metonymies and interactions with metaphor. Regardless of the ideology or end goals of the articles (placing blame, deflecting blame, looking for solutions, predicting the future economy), similar terminology was employed in very different articles, and patterns and themes emerged in verbal and non-verbal elements of texts about the crisis in the US and Europe.
In the following examples (taken from Text 1: Dithering at the Top Turned EU Crisis to Global Threat, from the online Wall Street Journal, December 29, 2011), metonymies of the financial crisis in Europe appear, including (a) debt crisis, (b) euro-zone debt crisis, and (c) immediate crisis. The key term associated with the European crisis is debt, which in Text 1 is largely linked to Greece. It is important to note that use of the lexical items debt and debt crisis (which activate the conceptual metonymy EFFECT FOR CAUSE) have strategic corporate uses and serve as mechanisms of manipulation (as found in Portero Muñoz, 2011), which have now been adopted unconsciously by all sides of the political spectrum. According to Lakoff and Wehling (2012, p. 68), framing the crisis in terms of debt works under the metaphor of NATION AS A FAMILY, and national budget=family budget, which masks the fact that money owed by the government is actually owed to citizens of the same country, with only a small amount to foreign nations. This proliferates the myth that the European Union’s debt was caused by indulgent government spending, and that the remedy is to eliminate as much of that spending as possible. Myth is used here according to the work of Barthes (1973), which shows how ideas are naturalized in the discourse to the point of becoming so conventional that we no longer think about what is behind them. Thus, as language constitutes us or those we seek to describe in the discourse (Foucault, 1981), and we think about ourselves or others through the discourse we use, some aspects become suppressed or concealed in order to legitimize a particular ideology (Machin & Mayr, 2012). This strategy hides the real causes of the crisis, which are out-of-control corporations lacking regulation (Goldberg, 2011).
Here below is an example of the use of the most common metaphor found in the texts dealing with the financial crisis: FINANCIAL CRISIS IS A NATURAL DISASTER (manifested through linguistic realization of ‘engulf’, ‘spread’ and ‘burn down’). In the example below, metonymies of EFFECT FOR CAUSE and NATURAL DISASTER FOR FINANCIAL DISASTER (wildfire), contrast with metonymies of MONEY FOR UNITY referring to the Euro as the only symbol of European unity, placing the crisis in direct opposition to a united Europe. Note the opposition of south vs. north, which fits within the image schema of

40 T. Catalano & L. R. Waugh
UP IS GOOD, DOWN IS BAD, with the metonymies DEFINING PROPERTY FOR CATEGORY (indebted south and richer north). These metonymies (and the phrase ‘outstrip the resources’) include pre-suppositions (Machin & Mayr, 2012, p. 153), placing implicit blame on the countries in debt instead of on individuals such as corporate executives or politicians, or on systemic effects of the power of corporations. See below for an example from Text 1.
x Like a wildfire, the spreading uncertainty threatened to engulf the whole of Europe's indebted south, to outstrip the resources of its richer north and to burn down the symbol of Europe's dream of unity, its single currency.
The following examples again highlight the indebted south by focusing on Greece in particular, and contain metonymies such as COUNTRY FOR PROBLEM (Greece), ACTION FOR EVENT (bailout) interacting with the metaphors of GREECE IS A PROBLEM/DISEASE (with linguistic realizations such as fixed and aid) and GREECE IS A BOAT (keep Greece afloat) which can only stay above water (debt) if the water is taken out of the boat (bailout). Moreover, the metonymies of PLACE/EFFECT FOR CAUSE and PLACE FOR PERSON in the words euro-zone debt crisis highlight the location of the crisis and link it to the area that has been affected, again hiding who is responsible (individuals in the government, banks, corporations, etc.) for this accumulation of debt.
x Greece, the country that triggered the euro-zone debt crisis, would need a much bigger bailout than planned, Mr. Strauss-Kahn said.
x Meanwhile, the cost for fixing Greece was rising. x They tried to please everyone: Greece would get more aid. x Europe hadn't resolved how to keep Greece afloat. x In April, after a year of drama and bailouts, the euro zone seemed to
have contained the immediate crisis to Greece and other small countries.
The following images appeared in the article (Text 1); clicking on the first image takes the reader to a series of videos of six European families talking about their lives and how the EU crisis has affected them personally. However, the photo the editor chose to include as a lead on to the videos shows a family in the Netherlands with the title “Netherlands: On solid ground”. Although the video shows photographs of the family leading a relatively happy and privileged life, with audio of the family talking about their lives and how well they are doing, the photo itself, which metonymically represents all of the families in the Euro zone, does not convey this message and subtly implies the opposite. This opposition is important to notice because the reader is not necessarily inclined to click on the image to view

the video, and therefore may see only this one photo, which contains several metonymies, which are conveyed through the use of positioning of the viewer in relation to people inside the image as well as color and typeface.

Zone, creating the conceptual

metonymy of MEMBER OF A CATEGORY FOR ENTIRE CATEGORY (this family

= all Euro Zone families) (Machin, 2007). The vertical camera angle is mostly

at eye level (signifying equality) with the head of the family (the father)

slightly above the focus of the photo, conveying his power and authority over

the family. In addition, the gaze (the extent to which we are encouraged to

engage with the participants) is non-existent, in that no one in the family is

looking at the viewer, and the viewer is not required to interact with the

participants. This objectivization suggests lack of power, since the actors are

not allowed or asked to address the viewer in the imaginary relationship they

have with him/her. Furthermore, the actors are looking down, which has the

simple metaphorical association where up is positive, powerful, high status

and down is negative, low energy, low status, and thus suggestive of negative

thoughts or worry (ibid, p. 113).

The use of color in this photograph is also significant. First to be examined is the brightness of the photo. According to Machin (ibid.), the meaning potential of brightness rests on the fundamental experiences we have with light and dark and the fundamental idea of truth as opposed to darkness as seen in the metonymy LIGHT FOR TRUTH (p. 70). Thus, the dim lighting in the photograph is suggestive of obscurity and heaviness. The relatively low saturation of the photo conveys emptiness or subtlety and the somewhat monochromatic nature of the color differentiation again highlights the seriousness of the article’s topic.

As for typeface, the title placed on the photo “Life in the Euro Zone” also carries meaning potential. In the case of the nouns in the title, the weight of the letters could be described as bold (in that the letters are thick), signifying a more substantial message and increased salience in order to highlight the serious nature of the article represented by the metonymy WEIGHT FOR

STRENGTH. The somewhat squat letters also add to the heaviness of the

issue, although the white color (probably chosen to contrast the dark colors

in the photo) gives it a lighter tone.

bloodshed or a broken body, where the EU is

seen as one body) and the metonymy STATE OF TYPEFACE FOR STATE OF

UNION.

Photo 5. The crisis cast.
Finally, in Photo 5, the persons involved in resolving the EU crisis are seen in the metaphor of actors in a play. The “cast members” are shown as they would be in a theatrical program, and they are referred to with metonymies such as crisis cast and players. This metaphor of the Euro crisis as a theatrical production was found throughout Text 1, and is coherent with the previous example where it was referred to as a year of drama and bailouts. The unrealistic hues (such as the yellow of Angela Merkel’s and green of Dominique Strauss-Kahn’s face, respectively) convey the essence of the crisis and the persons involved rather than the crisis itself (Machin, 2007) and further dramatize the issue and the people involved in resolving it, without placing any blame. This type of image makes the news more newsworthy and evokes notions of spectacles, which, while it brings attention to the article, downplays the criminal nature of what is behind the crisis (Mayr & Machin, 2012).

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 31-60 43
The next examples from Texts 2-5 deal with the financial crisis in the United States. As in Text 1, many different metonymies of natural disaster or disease were found to refer to the crisis regardless of the main message of the article. Note the metonymies of EFFECT FOR CAUSE (meltdown, disaster, downturn, mess, abyss, slowdown), NATURAL/NUCLEAR DISASTER FOR FINANCIAL DISASTER (meltdown, storm, aftermath), SIMPLIFIED EVENT FOR COMPLEX SUB-EVENTS (failure, debacle, bad luck, wrongdoing) and their interactions with metaphors such as FINANCIAL CRISIS IS A NATURAL DISASTER (erupting, trembled, predictable aftershocks, green shoots), FINANCIAL CRISIS IS A DISEASE (symptoms, immune system, recovery, remedying), THE ECONOMY/DEBT IS A BOAT (sank the world financial system) and FINANCIAL CRISIS IS A BOOK (the final chapter . . .):
Ȉ The study supports what industry insiders have been saying for years: that hedge funds have been unfairly blamed for the worst financial meltdown in decades. (Text 2)
Ȉ Problems kept erupting, efforts to restore calm failed, and we trembled on the brink of a financial abyss in 2008-09. (Text 3)
Ȉ There’s a long way to go before the economy, and people, recover from wounds inflicted by the financial meltdown. (Text 3)
Ȉ I’ve been writing about the financial meltdown and its aftermath almost continually since I joined Fortune the month after the symptoms surfaced (Text 3)
Ȉ We could well have ended up with a downturn worse than the Great Depression, which was the previous time that failures in the financial system (rather than the Federal Reserve raising rates) begat a US economic slowdown. (Text 3)
Ȉ We’ve had more than enough shrieking and demonizing since this mess erupted in 2007. It’s time that we stopped trying to blame “the other”—be it poor people or rich people or Wall Street or community organizers—for the problems that almost sank the world financial system. (Text 3)
Ȉ There was talk of “green shoots” and the “recovery summer.” Events in Greece and in oil markets were chalked up to bad luck rather than the predictable aftershocks of a financial crisis. (Text 4)
Ȉ “Now knowing how much worse the storm was, people look back and say, you guys undershot,” sighs Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner.
Ȉ These crises have a sort of immune system. (Text 4) Ȉ Mr. Cuomo, as a Wall Street enforcer, had been questioning banks and
rating agencies aggressively for more than a year about their roles in the growing debacle, and also looking into bonuses at A.I. G. (Text 5) Ȉ An S.E.C. spokesman said: “The primary consideration was remedying the alleged wrongdoing and in fashioning that remedy, the emphasis was

44 T. Catalano & L. R. Waugh
placed on retail investors because they were suffering the greatest hardship and had the fewest avenues for redress.” (Text 5) Ȉ The Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, created by Congress to investigate the origins of the disaster… (Text 5) Ȉ The final chapter still hasn’t been written about the financial crisis and its aftermath. (Text 5)
The above examples point to a general tendency in discourse about the financial crisis to avoid the language of crime, and use vague language filled with references to natural disasters and disease. All of the terms such as ‘meltdown’, ‘storm’, ‘debacle’ and ‘mess’ avoid naming who is responsible. Once again, this is a case of hiding the real culprits. The storm itself may be no one’s fault, but good prior planning or regulations (such as not building houses on the seashore where they can be destroyed by a storm) could make the effects of the storm less. Hence it is implementation of the discourse of natural disaster that makes events related to the financial crisis appear to be “natural” and thus, we cannot be responsible for the terrible effects it has. Therefore, it should not be surprising that four years after the financial crisis, not one financial executive has gone to jail, even though some of the articles analyzed pointed that out (Ferguson, 2012). In fact, we argue that one of the reasons why this is so, is precisely because of the neutralization and naturalization of the language involved in the discourse about the financial crisis, and the way that this language shapes public opinion about who is responsible. According to Mayr and Machin (2012), these techniques of neutralization are part of the nature of the coverage of corporate crime, and work to mitigate and justify criminal conduct. Moreover, corporations and Wall Street executives, through their ownership of mass media, have privileged access to, and control of, how information is managed. Thus, it is often their choice as to the kind of language that is used, and the criminal nature of the events is therefore discussed again in the context of noncriminal terms (ibid, p. 215). As Charles Ferguson notes in his book, explaining political and corporate corruption related to the crisis: “Regulation is nice, but the threat of prison focuses the mind” (2012, p. 2). If journalists and editors are serious about getting to the bottom of the issue and persuading the public to put more pressure on government institutions, such as the Department of Justice, to prosecute Wall Street executives involved in the crisis, they need to use language that activates conceptual metonymies that do not mitigate the results. The same goes for image.
In addition to terms to refer to the financial crisis, many different terms and images (as seen from Text 1) were used to represent the people responsible for the crisis or for resolving it. Here are a few:

metonymies are helpful in conveying a vague idea of who is

responsible, without placing direct blame on any specific individuals. This

image appears under the title ‘In Financial Crisis No Prosecution of Top

message that asks the question, why have no high-profile participants in the

the person he is gesturing toward, most likely the SEC. Notice again the

fingers pointing in the direction of the accusers (BODY PARTS FOR ACTION,

indexical qualities of the pointing gesture)

Also in the same text Wall Street executives are referred to metonymically by the name of the company they work for (e.g., Bear Stearns) and then through another metonymy as players (DEFINING PROPERTY FOR PERSON). All of this interacts with the metaphor THE ECONOMY IS A GAME (players, rules would be applied).

6 This is in opposition to mug shots, which are the standard in crime reports. For examples of contrasting ways that minority groups are seen in crime reports see Catalano & Waugh, 2012 and Catalano, 2012.

46 T. Catalano & L. R. Waugh
Ȉ At Bear Stearns, the first major Wall Street player to collapse (Text 5) Ȉ It’s consistent with what many people were worried about during the
crisis, that different rules would be applied to different players. (Text 5)
Additionally in Text 5, we see again the use of neutralizing terminology and non-crime news frames to refer to the illegal act of misrepresentation, that is, lying about the state of the company in order to convince shareholders to invest in something so they could profit. The use of these verbs combined with metonymies not associated with crime (e.g., ‘suit’) adds to the effect of mitigating the responsibility of those accused (‘Bank of America’).
Ȉ The suit accuses them of understating the losses of Merrill Lynch to shareholders before the deal was approved; the case is still pending. (Text 5)
Ȉ He was interested in whether the banks had misled the ratings agencies about the quality of the loans they were bundling and asked how many workers they had hired from the ratings agencies. (Text 5)
All things considered, the author of Text 5 does a good job presenting the case that not enough has been done to investigate and incriminate the individuals and systems responsible for the crisis. However, the above analysis indicates the author’s case (as was common in all the articles about the financial crisis that were examined) was weakened by the continued use of vague conceptual metonymies or metonymies of natural disaster (such as wrongdoings, disaster), language of neutralization (misled, understated), metonymies of INSTITUTION FOR PERSON, which mask the responsibility of the CEO, CFO, etc. (Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch), as well as image metonymies that weaken the case against those responsible by not identifying specific people (similar to verbal metonymy of INSTITUTION FOR PERSON), or in the case of Angelo Mozilo, presenting a positive image of the accused.
4.2. Fiscal cliff
The term “fiscal cliff” was coined by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke who used the phrase at a congressional hearing in February, 2012 (Jackson, 2012) to refer to a series of across-the-board federal tax increases and spending cuts that would kick in if Congress were unable to put together a new “debt reduction” agreement. Thus the term stands for the economic effects that could result from these tax increases and spending cuts and activates the metonymies of PLACE FOR ACTION (cliff stands for being in a dangerous place, and possibly falling over, jumping off) and EFFECT FOR CAUSE (jumping off a cliff stands for the cause: economic decline). These then interact with the metaphorical association UP IS GOOD, BAD IS DOWN, and the resulting conceptual metaphor FINANCIAL INSECURITY IS DOWN. Here

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 31-60 47

below are some examples of how the metonymy fiscal cliff has been used in financial discourse in image and text.
Ȉ House Republicans sharply divided on 'fiscal cliff' deal (Text 6 title) Ȉ A sharply divided House Republican leadership struggled to reach
agreement on a measure to avoid part of the so-called “fiscal cliff,” as key members said they could not support the compromise approved early Tuesday by the Senate. (Text 6) Ȉ The tax increases and spending cuts in the “fiscal cliff” would sharply reduce the deficit – too sharply in the eyes of most economists. (Text 6) Ȉ With a token the size of a penny, the White House could head off another round of Congressional brinkmanship and another run at a fiscal cliff. (Text 7)
In the above examples, it is easy to see that the metonym ‘fiscal cliff’ has become so conventionalized that it is used in situations where the stand-for relationship is no longer obvious. This confusion plays on the fears of citizens as they struggle to understand what is being referred to (is it the cuts and increases, the agreement to be made, or what will happen to the economy?). One example of this is in the term ‘fiscal cliff deal’, where the economic results of the cuts/tax increases have now been turned into an adjective that stands metonymically for the agreement that must be made to avoid disastrous economic effects. In addition, fiscal cliff is seen as a container (‘in the fiscal cliff’), and a place to avoid or run at. Because of its status as a metonym coined by Bernanke, journalists are confused about how to use the term, even in the same article: as a normal (albeit metonymic) phrase (no quotes), as a phrase that should not be taken literally (single quotes), or as a phrase coined by a known source (double quotes). See Table 1 for details.

The image below in Photo 8 (corresponding with Text 7 and interacting with the title and caption) dramatizes the effects the fiscal cliff could have, making the fiscal cliff concrete (with the photograph of the paycheck) and something that all citizens can relate to. The photo then activates the metonymy of SIMPLIFIED EVENT FOR COMPLEX SUB-EVENTS in which the photo of the

paycheck represents all the possible effects of the fiscal cliff (and possibly the most salient to the readers).

These linguistic and non-linguistic

realizations then activate (through

the conceptual metaphor of

to discussion about the national

‘deficit’ or ‘debt’, the term fiscal cliff

frequently collates with other metonymies such as ‘national debt’, ‘debt limit’

and ‘debt ceiling’, as in the following examples:

Ȉ As the national debt has grown, the Treasury has periodically bumped against this debt limit or debt ceiling. (Text 7)
Ȉ The 2011 deal pushed the next collision with the debt ceiling past the 2012 elections, but by late that year the Treasury Department was warning that it would run out of room to maneuver on the debt sometime in early 2013. (Text 7)

According to Lakoff and Wehling, concepts like deficit, debt and debt ceiling are part of the “family budget metaphor,” which inaccurately equates a national budget to a family budget, backgrounding the fact that we as a nation owe money to ourselves, can print money and borrow it cheaply, and also that conservative tax anti-regulation and subsidy policies are significant causes of debt (2012, p. 116). Unfortunately, this conservative framing of the family budget = national budget has been used by both sides of the political spectrum (to the benefit of conservatives) and hides the way that the nation can strengthen its economy by internal investment. This could be done by using borrowed money to create jobs in infrastructure, education, health, and research, which would be one way to strengthen the economy and get out of debt (ibid, p. 68). The metonymy of PHYSICAL BOUNDARY FOR HYPOTHETICAL BOUNDARY (debt ceiling) turns an imaginary limit into a more concrete one and is further reinforced by the metaphor of DEBT IS A ROOM in which we can bump or collide with the ceiling if we have too much (see examples above). This metonymy further strengthens the moral cascade related to the nation as a family and the family budget. Alternative ways to discuss these fiscal policies might be to call them deficit creation policies and

7 Payroll companies warn Congress must act soon to avoid the fiscal cliff—or risk confusing companies about how much to pay their workers.

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 31-60 49

use the words ‘revenue neglect’ and ‘undertaxing’ to discuss them, which would lead to more progressive cascades (Lakoff & Wehling, 2012). In addition to the metonymies for debt, it is worth noting that in the above examples we also see the frequent metonymy of INSTITUTION FOR PERSON (Treasury, Treasury Department) in which the institution where the individuals work substitutes for the individuals actually responsible for the actions, and thus again, specific people are not held responsible for these actions.

Photo 9 of the New York Times Square Debt

Clock (Photo 9) provides another example of

sensationalism in image (in addition to the

‘crisis cast’ from Photo 5) and the metonymy of

CAUSE FOR RESULT where the clock reminds

us that time is ticking and the effect is coming

(like a bomb going off) if we do not change our

ways. This sensationalism is further

elaborated by the timer’s surface being

covered in print that resembles money where

money stands for debt (RESULT FOR AGENT)

and the red numbers on black background,

classic framing of any bomb ready to go off on

image also cuts off the other words that are

included with the words debt and clock (‘Our national’ at the top, ‘Your family

share’ to the left of the second row of numbers, and ‘The National Debt’ to the

left of Clock); this cropping of the image highlights the two words debt and

clock, and further exaggerates the issue.

4.3. Underwater
The term underwater (referring to owing more on a house than it is worth) corresponds with the frequent metaphors involving money and water found in financial discourse. Thus because water is an essential ingredient of life (as well as a large part of our physical make-up), it is frequently equated metaphorically with money, another fundamental element necessary for daily life in Western society. But water can also be dangerous or unwanted: a human being who is under water can drown; floods that inundate areas with homes, leading to a significant amount of water in a house or even completely covering a house, are disastrous and destructive. In the texts examined for this paper, the following examples were found of metonymies related to being underwater; it is important to note that in all cases here, what is ‘underwater’ is human beings (homeowners, borrowers, people):

50 T. Catalano & L. R. Waugh
Ȉ If it had moved more quickly to appoint a director when it had firmer control of the Senate, it could perhaps have used Fannie and Freddie to kick off a giant wave of refinancing for underwater homeowners. (Text 4)
Ȉ “Cramdown,” in which judges simply reduce the principal owed by underwater homeowners, works this way. (Text 4)
Ȉ On first blush, there are few groups more sympathetic than underwater homeowners or foreclosed families. (Text 4)
Ȉ It was always in the room when you were trying to help one underwater homeowner write off some debt while the person next door was playing by the rules and paying their mortgage every month. (Text 4)
Ȉ As he met with distressed homeowners in Las Vegas, the foreclosure capital of the nation, Obama announced steps to allow “underwater” borrowers to refinance their mortgages at today’s ultra-low rate—near 4 percent. (Text 9)
Ȉ Home values are hovering at eight-year lows, and more than 10 million people are underwater, or owe more than their homes are worth. (Text 9)
Ȉ Originally designed to help up to 5 million people, nearly three years later it has reached only 822,000, one-tenth of whom are significantly underwater. (Text 9)
As seen from the above examples the term underwater is used to create the conceptual metonymies of HOME FOR BOAT/HOME FOR LIFE: thus when things go bad, the boat sinks, causing the owner to be underwater and subject to drowning=losing one’s home, where home stands for one’s life).8 The term ‘foreclosed families’ also activates a metonymy of DEFINING PROPERTY FOR CATEGORY creating sympathy by including reference to family. The same metonymy is created when ‘underwater’ appears with borrowers or homeowners, emphasizing the agency of the person owning the home, and hiding who is responsible for giving them the loan in the first place. In addition to underwater homeowners and borrowers other metonymies such as ‘giant wave’, ‘illiquid markets’ and ‘liquid investments’ (RESULT FOR ACTION) are in force in these examples, as well as the metaphors of FINANCIAL SECURITY IS UP, FINANCIAL INSECURITY IS DOWN. Here are some examples of how they were used in the discourse:
Ȉ In addition, the study said, “the potential remains for the leverage of large funds to quickly balloon and for the industry to find itself needing to sell assets in very illiquid markets when the next crisis hits.” (Text 2)
Ȉ For years, companies like UBS and Goldman Sachs operated auctions of these securities, promoting them as highly liquid investments. (Text 5)
8 Notice the use of home as opposed to “house”. The former has much more emotional power because it’s where the occupiers make a life for themselves; it’s not just a building.

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 31-60 51
Ȉ Europe hadn't resolved how to keep Greece afloat. (Text 1) Ȉ Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, speaking at the same meeting,
said the government could bump into its borrowing limit before the end of the year, but, he said, the Treasury has enough “tools” to keep the government afloat into early 2013. (Text 8) Ȉ Trichet, in the twilight of a 36-year career as a finance official, feared that if Greece didn't honor its bond debts on time, the implicit trust that kept credit flowing to many weak euro-zone governments would shatter. (Text 1)
In addition to more metonymies substituting company names for those responsible for the problem (UBS and Goldman Sachs), the word ‘liquid’ is used to refer to the fluid movement of cash through buying and selling, and the fact that stocks/bonds/mutual funds, etc. can be easily sold for ‘real’ money. Thus if a market is ‘liquid’ or has ‘liquidity’, one can easily buy and sell. Additionally when an investment is liquid, it can be bought and sold easily without much effect on its market price. As mentioned above, these linguistic realizations activate the conceptual metonymy of RESULT FOR ACTION (liquid stands for the movement of the money through buying and selling). The other examples above illustrate a complex combination of metaphor and metonymy in which words such as ‘afloat’ activate metonymies of HOME FOR BOAT/HOME FOR LIFE, which then set off metaphors of MONEY IS WATER (flowing) and DEBT IS WATER (staying afloat is staying out of debt). These complex combinations are examples of what Mittelberg and Waugh (2009) refer to as “metonymy first, metaphor second”.
These metaphors and metonymies further contribute to the ideology of the vital nature of money, which feeds into neoliberalism (Block et al, 2012) and the infiltration of corporations on everyday thought.
In Photo 10, taken from Text 9 (entitled “Government announces new program to help ‘underwater’ homeowners”), Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is seen talking in the oval office with President Obama (and an aid in the background). The photo presents an interesting metonymy whereby Geithner’s hand gestures stand for Photo 10. Underwater mortgages. (Text 9) the relationship between what a homeowner owes and what the house is worth. Accompanied by the title, this metonymy (BODY PART FOR ACTION) helps to illustrate the idea of ’underwater’ homeowners through the metaphorical association with

52 T. Catalano & L. R. Waugh

verticality in that the owners are below (because the house is sinking in debt) and the house is above, again UP IS GOOD and BAD IS DOWN. Moreover, we see the metonymy of INSTITUTION FOR PERSON with the term Government standing for those responsible for this new policy (members of the Obama administration and the Federal Housing Finance Agency). The result of the use of Government in the title of Text 9 is that the government’s role in helping underwater homeowners is highlighted, and the role of the individuals responsible (such as President Obama, who is the head of the government) is hidden.

A similar photo appeared in Text

5 in which the financial crisis and

the savings and loan “debacle” of

the late 1980’s are compared. In

ACTION), Geithner’s hands

the two events being compared

as if they are vertically equal.

Seen here with Ben Bernanke,

Federal Reserve Chairman, a concerned-looking Geithner is shown to be active and engaged in the conversation, looking

directly at Bernanke, while Bernanke appears to be gazing in a disinterested

manner off camera at something in the distance. In both photos it is clear that

the hand gesture is meant to illustrate the text.

4.4. Entitlements
The final financial element to be examined is that of entitlements. The terms ‘entitlements’ or ‘entitlement program’ refer to programs such as Medicare, social security, Medicaid, veterans benefits, etc. which are mostly deferred pay. For example, health care, pensions and severance pay are all forms of earned income, but metonyms such as ‘entitlements’ and ‘benefits’ hide this fact, and exist in the entitlement frame, which is separate from the earned frame. In the entitlement frame (capitalizing on the definition of entitlements = amount to which a person has a right to something), you can be entitled to money without earning it. Thus, all payments should be earned and no one is entitled to anything (Lakoff & Wehling, 2012). Because this metonymy (RIGHT FOR DEFERRED PAYMENT) taps into conservative frames and thinking that activates cascades related to a strict father model of morality, its use does not persuade readers to support these programs. In spite of this, all sides of the political spectrum (as the following examples from different texts

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 31-60 53

demonstrate) use the term, even to the detriment of those that support the programs (such as the author of Text 11). Here are some examples from the texts:

Ȉ Spending on entitlements is the highest in American history. (Text 10) Ȉ Out-of-control entitlements are a major threat to national security. (Text
10) Ȉ The explosive growth in entitlement spending, while well-intentioned and
in many cases necessary, is bad for the economy and our workforce. (Text 10)

In the above examples it is easy to see how the metonymies related to government programs (‘entitlement spending’, ‘out-of-control entitlements’, ‘entitlements’) work to support the text’s ideology against these programs. In the following examples from Text 11, the author highlights how many Americans actually benefit from the program, in an attempt to garner support. However, the use of the metonymies ‘entitlement programs’ and ‘spending programs’ work against this by activating conservative frames.

Ȉ Forget the 47%. A new study finds that 71% of Americans live in a household in which at least one member has benefited from one of the federal government’s major entitlement programs. (Text 11)
Ȉ The new data, based on a survey by the Pew Research center, underscore the wide reach of the spending programs that make up the lion’s share of the federal budget. More than half of Americans (55%) have personally benefited from one of the government’s six best-known entitlement programs, including 53% of people who voted for Mitt Romney in November’s election and 59% of those who voted for President Obama. (Text 11)

on the woman in the

foreground creating the

metonymies of ACTION FOR AGENT/DEFINING PROPERTY FOR CATEGORY.

These metonymies detract from the message by highlighting the action of

54 T. Catalano & L. R. Waugh

protesting (which activates conservative frames that view this as immoral in the strict father model) and hide the actions that citizens are engaged in (such as working) in order to become eligible for certain programs. In addition, the pose of the woman carries meaning, since poses are an important realm of connotation in images that are able to signify broader values, ideas and identities (Barthes, 1973). In the case of Photo 12, the woman is standing looking off camera to her left with an almost pleading look on her face, elaborating on the image’s message of protesting the loss of government programs. She is at mid-distance and does not interact with the viewer. Hence, we are bystanders watching her, but not invited to engage with her directly. Moreover, her head is tilted slightly to the side as if she is listening to someone off camera. Her agency in the action of protesting (with a focal point on the bright red sign “NO CUTS”) is the focus of the photograph, not her individuality nor her needs. In summary, the image does not help communicate the message of the text, and the metonymies of ACTION FOR AGENT, DEFINING PROPERTY FOR CATEGORY play a large role in this miscommunication. A better choice for an image in this article (more supportive of the author’s somewhat covert aims) might have been a photo of women in the workplace, showing why they are eligible for worker-earned health care and deferred pay.

5. Conclusion
In this multimodal analysis of financial discourse, metonymies were found in both text and image that euphemistically focus on peripheral parts or properties of the scenarios and thus avoid mentioning specific results or those responsible. Some of the most common metonymies found in the discourse included some found in Portero Muñoz’s (2012) study such as EFFECT FOR CAUSE, RESULT FOR ACTION and SIMPLIFIED EVENTS FOR COMPLEX SUB-EVENTS (referred to by Portero Muñoz as PART OF THE EVENT FOR THE WHOLE EVENT). In addition, this study uncovered metonymies such as PLACE FOR ACTION, DEFINING PROPERTY FOR CATEGORY, INSTITUTION FOR PERSON, BODY PART FOR ACTION, MEMBER OF A CATEGORY FOR ENTIRE CATEGORY and LIGHT FOR TRUTH that were found in text (see Table 2) or image (see Table 3) or both. Additionally, many sequences based on the interaction of metaphoric and metonymic processes were also found such as the metaphor NATURAL DISASTER IS FINANCIAL DISASTER interacting with the metonymy NATURAL DISASTER FOR FINANCIAL DISASTER (a wildfire that spreads and burns) and in the case of underwater homeowners creating metonymies such as HOUSE FOR BOAT and DEBT FOR WATER that interact with metaphorical associations of UP IS GOOD/DOWN IS BAD.

This study contributes to the relatively new body of literature on the role of metonymy (both verbal and visual) in political/financial discourse and the use of metonymical analysis for the purposes of social justice. Consequently, we encourage more academics to raise consciousness of this manipulation by using their knowledge of metaphor and metonymy and the power this knowledge provides to counteract the degree of disparity in wealth and power (caused by corporate deregulation and a flawed system) that is becoming more and more the norm in today’s democratic societies.

The issues of construct definition and assessment authenticity in videobased listening comprehension tests: Using an argument-based validation approach
Zhi LI, Iowa State University, USA
The advancement in technology has paved the way for the inclusion of videos in L2 listening comprehension tests. It is true that video listening test format is becoming more popular in various contexts. But, as existing research shows, there are still some on-going debates over the practice of video-based listening tests. Taking an argument-based validation approach (Chapelle, Enright, & Jamieson, 2008), this paper focuses on the issues of construct definition and test authenticity in video-based listening tests. The inferences of Domain definition and Explanation were introduced to help contextualize the issues. Empirical studies suggest that the controversial role of visual-related skills in the construct of video-based listening tests is not well recognized both in theory and in practice. The commonly held assumption that the introduction of videos into listening tests boosts authenticity is questionable with a closer look at the two aspects of authenticity, namely, situational and interactional authenticity. Therefore, more empirical research and theoretical thinking are needed to warrant the use of videos in listening tests. Some suggestions concerning videobased listening test development and validation studies are made at the end of this paper.
Keywords: Video-Based Listening Comprehension Tests; Argument-Based Validity; Construct Definition; Authenticity
1. Introduction
This paper addresses the controversial issue of using video in L2 listening tests under the framework of argument-based validity, more specifically from the perspectives of construct definition and assessment authenticity. The last two decades have witnessed a steady growth of video-based listening test development and research. Currently, video-based listening tests are becoming a popular test format in many low-stakes institutional tests. However, while enjoying the acclaimed authenticity, this practice has also been questioned for the representativeness of the construct (Buck, 2001; Coniam, 2001; Feak & Salehzadeh, 2001; Ockey, 2007; Read, 2002). Following

the traditional view of language proficiency, Buck (2001) maintained that listening tests should assess the unique characteristics of listening ability and cautioned language testers about the possible inducement of constructirrelevant variance if videos are used in listening tests. However, this skillbased view has been challenged by other language testing researchers, such as Wagner and Gruba, who argued for an enlargement of listening construct and put authenticity as one of the priorities in listening test development. They posited that the inclusion of videos reflects the key characteristic in real-life communication and thus provides a strengthened authenticity (Gruba, 1997; Wager, 2008, 2010a, 2010b).
The debate over video use in listening tests will surely continue. Undoubtedly, with technology advancement, we can expect that more and more videobased listening tests will be developed for various purposes. Although technology use will promote language testing practices, I still maintain that the use of videos in listening tests requires more critical support from theory and empirical studies. A critical analysis of the use of video in listening tests is very important. On the one hand, we understand from common sense that listening comprehension process in mono-input mode is definitely different from a bi-modal or multi-modal comprehension process. Hence, the construct of video-based listening tests should be well-defined with sound theoretical basis. Furthermore, test-takers’ interaction with videos in listening tests is still not well-documented. The assumption that adding videos will contribute to a better authenticity needs more empirical evidence.
In this paper, I situate the discussion of the use of video in listening test within an argument-based validity framework (Chapelle, et al., 2008). Construct definition and assessment authenticity in listening tests are explored in the inferences of Domain definition and Explanation. Firstly, a brief overview of the current development of video-based listening tests will be presented. Then, I will introduce the framework of argument-based validity. The concept of situational authenticity is discussed with reference to the inference of Domain definition. Following this, the inference of Explanation is elaborated with a discussion of two construct definition approaches in listening tests and the role of videos in listening construct. Furthermore, the issue of interactional authenticity is presented as a challenge to the common assumption that the inclusion of videos can boost assessment authenticity. Lastly, implications and suggestions concerning video-based listening construct definition and assessment authenticity are made.

Although the important role of non-verbal information in listening

comprehension has long been acknowledged by many researchers (Rubin, 1994), the practice of using videos in listening tests is only a relatively new attempt. So far most of the video-based listening tests reported in language testing literature are either some tests of exploratory nature in some research projects (Coniam, 2001; Elkhafaifi; 2005; Ockey, 2007; Parry & Meredith,1984; Progosh, 1996; Sueyoshi & Hardison, 2005; Wagner, 2007, 2008, 2010a, 2010b) or in-house placement tests used at some universities (Feak & Salehzadeh, 2001). One of the early experiments on the effect of videos on listening comprehension was conducted by Parry and Meredith (1984). Parry and Meredith designed a videotape-mediated Spanish listening test with 27 short everyday conversations among native Spanish speakers and administered the video-based listening test and an audio-only version of the same test to two groups of students (178 in total) from the first three years of college Spanish classes. The results indicated that videotapes provided students with more stimuli and contributed to their listening comprehension.
There are also some studies on the development of video-based listening tests for placement purpose at universities. Feak and Salehzadeh (2001) reported on their designing process of an English for Specific Purposes (ESP) videobased listening placement test and justified their use of videos in listening test with a requirement of close connection with curricular characteristics and better authenticity. By contrast, large-scale, high-stakes language proficiency tests, such as TOEFL and IELTS appear to be more cautious in making the decision of using videos in listening tests. For example, in the new TOEFL framework the situation factors are considered as one of the three elements of task characteristics. As a result, content and contextual visual (still images) are currently included in its new listening test as a part of situational factor. However, while acknowledging the potential benefits of enhanced face validity and authenticity brought about by videos, Bejar, Douglas, Jamieson, Nissan, and Turner (2000) claimed that more research was needed to decide whether the use of videos will help achieve better “measurement advantages” over the use of still images.
Currently, the bulk of existing research on video-based listening tests centers on the comparison of test-takers’ performances on tests in video mode and audio-only mode. In light of the positive influence of multimedia in language teaching, it is expected that videos in listening tests will improve test-takers’ performance because of the visual support presented, as shown in Parry and Meredith’s study. However, the existing studies on video-based listening tests only yield conflicting results regarding the effect of videos.
Facilitative effects of videos in listening test performances have been confirmed in some studies. For example, Shin (1998) found a salient positive

64 Z. Li
effect of video in her study on a listening comprehension test. 83 ESL learners were assigned to either audio-only listening test group or video-based listening test group. The results indicated that video group learners outperformed the ones on audio-only test by 24%. Sueyoshi and Hardison (2005) focused on the effects of hand-gestures and facial expressions on L2 learners’ listening comprehension and manipulated a lecture videotape in three formats: audio-only, face-only video, and hand-gesture-and-face video. 42 ESL students were randomly assigned to three groups, taking a test in one of the three input modes. Sueyoshi and Hardison found that both video groups performed significantly better than the audio-only group; whereas there was no significant performance difference between the video groups. Wagner (2010b) adopted a quasi-experimental design in a study of videobased listening test, which consisted of three lecturettes and three dialogues. He administered one of the two versions of the same test (audio-only vs. video) to two different groups of ESL learners and observed that test-takers’ performance in video-based listening test group was 6.5% higher than the audio-only listening test group.
However, on the other hand, other studies indicate some mixed findings about performance difference on listening tests that only differ in input modes. Gruba (1993) assigned 91 undergraduate and graduate ESL students into video group and audio group in a listening test. He found no significant performance difference between the two groups. Brett (1997) reported a mixed result in his listening comprehension study, in which 49 undergraduates were assigned to three groups and took audio-only, video and multimedia (computer-based context with immediate feedback) tests respectively. It is found that learners’ performances on video test were not consistent across listening tasks, learners in video group scored higher than audio-only group on four tasks but lower on other two tasks. In Coniam (2001), no significant difference was found between the test performances of 104 English language teachers at Hong Kong on the audio and video versions of the same listening test. Suvorov (2008) compared 34 ESL students’ test performances on six listening passages, which were presented in three modes – audio, photograph-mediated audio, and video. Suvorov found that testtakers scored significantly lower on video-mediated passages than on audioonly and photograph-mediated passage tasks while no significant difference existed between the performances on audio-only passages and photographmediated passages. As shown from the mentioned comparative studies, these conflicting findings foreshadow the complexity of test-takers’ interaction with videos in listening tests.
There are some hypotheses behind the positive and negative influence of videos on listening comprehension. According to the connectionist view of listening comprehension, the inclusion of visual information can help

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 61-82 65
listeners identify speakers and contexts, thus helping listeners form and modify their own hypotheses and inferences during the listening process (Antes, 1996; Guichon & McLornan, 2008; Hulstijn, 2003; Kellerman, 1990; Lynch, 2009; White, Easton, & Anderson, 2000;). On the other hand, the main explanation for the negative effects of video is approached from the cognitive load perspective, which suggests that videos can be a distractor to test-takers especially when the video contents are less relevant or in conflict with the audio input (Ginther, 2002; Gruba, 2004). This idea coincides with the concept of “seductive-details effect” in visual studies, which is the hindrance of comprehension caused by increased amount of information (Gruba, 2004; Schroeders, Wilhelm, & Bucholtz, 2010).
The aforementioned studies are very revealing in terms of the effects of video in listening tests, However, the essential question about the construct of listening comprehension, that is, whether video in listening tests poses as a construct-relevant or construct-irrelevant factor is not directly addressed. In the following sections, I will discuss the issues of construct definition and test authenticity in video-based listening tests under the framework of argumentbased validity.
3. Argument-based approach to validation studies
Traditionally, validation has been mainly approached with attention to the three major elements of validity structure, namely construct validity, content validity and criterion-referenced validity. By contrast, the recent development of validity theory witnessed a shift to an argument-based approach (Bachman & Palmer, 2010, Chapelle, Enright, & Jamieson, 2008; Kane, 2006), which shows some advantages over traditional ways (Chapelle et al., 2010). Chapelle et al. point out that an argument-based validation can make a difference in four aspects—“framing the intended score interpretation, outlining the essential research, structuring research results into a validity argument, and challenging the validity argument” (Chapelle, Enright & Jamieson, 2010, p.3). Nearly all the previous studies on video-based listening tests were conducted without clear score inferences and systematic research agenda. An argument-based approach can help identify key issues in video-based listening tests and situate the research in a coherent framework.
There are three similar argument-based validity frameworks proposed by Kane (2006), Chapelle et al. (2008), and Bachman and Palmer (2010), respectively. A common feature is that validity is taken as an argument which calls for warrants and rebuttals to make stepwise inferences of test scores. To avoid confusion in the terminology, I will use the terminology from Chapelle et al. 2008, which is based on Kane (2006). There are two components in Kane and Chapelle et al.’s frameworks: Interpretive Argument and Validity

66 Z. Li
Argument. According to Kane (2006, p.23):
An interpretive Argument specifies the proposed interpretations and uses of test results by laying out the network of inferences and assumptions leading from the observed performances to the conclusions and decisions based on the performances. The validity argument provides an evaluation of the interpretive argument (Cronbach, 1988). To claim that a proposed interpretation or use is valid is to claim that the interpretive argument is coherent, that its inferences are reasonable, and that its assumptions are plausible.
In Kane (2006), four inferences in interpretive argument, including scoring, generalization, extrapolation, implication/decision, are illustrated to help researchers link test performance observation to proper trait interpretation and test score use. In between these two ends there lie three more steps, establishing observed score, universe score, and target score. Scoring inference is a number or value assigning process, made based on test performance and through using scoring rubrics. Generalization inference deals with the relationship between the observed score from a specific test situation to universe score of all the parallel forms of the same test. Extrapolation inference goes beyond testing contexts and looks at test-takers’ actual performance in real life situations or target score. Implication inference or decision inference is about the use of target score either in terms of construct understanding or decision-making. In this sense, following the metaphors used by Chapelle et. al. (2008), the inferences function as bridges to link test performance to score interpretations and uses.
Chapelle et al. (2008) expanded Kane’s framework and applied it to their TOEFL validation study. Six inferential links were identified: Domain definition, Evaluation (Scoring inference in Kane’s term), Generalization, Explanation, Extrapolation, and Utilization (see Figure 1). The salient feature in this framework is the addition of Domain definition and Explanation. Both inferences address the concern about the underlying construct to be measured, but in different ways. Domain definition inference reveals the connection between the skills elicited in target language use (TLU) tasks and those in test tasks, whereas Explanation inference links test performance to theoretical account of the construct. Similar to Kane’s framework, the establishment of each inference requires warrant(s), rebuttal(s) and corresponding backings. Warrant in Chapelle et al. (2008) is defined as a “generally held principle” or “rule of thumb” (p. 6). A rebuttal usually provides evidence to weaken an inferential link between grounds and a claim. Both warrant and rebuttal need specific backing(s) to authorize an inferential link. In this paper, I will focus on the inferences of Domain definition and

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 61-82 67
Explanation (see Figure 1, adopted from Chapelle et al., 2008, p.18), which are essential for the issues of construct definition and test authenticity.
Figure 1. Structure of interpretive argument for video-based listening test. 4. Domain definition inference 4. 1. Domain analysis According to Chapelle et al. (2008), domain description can serve as a departure point for both test development and validation studies because this inference links target domain and test task modeling. The Domain definition inference is based on the warrant that observations of performance on a specific video-based listening test reveal relevant knowledge, skills, and abilities in situations that are representative of those in the target domain of language use (Chapelle et al., 2008). Accordingly, the assumptions underlying this warrant are that the target domain is identifiable and the features of tasks in the target domain are simulatable. For the inference of domain definition a rebuttal is that there may be some important features in real-life situations that are omitted in the video-based listening tasks.

Take institutional English placement test as an example, we can reasonably expect an inclusion of videos in the listening section because visual aids have been very common in various classes. An example would be online or hybrid courses in which lectures are delivered as either live or via prepared videos (Al-Jarf, 2011). A follow-up question would be what types of videos should be used for testing purposes. The assumptions underlying the warrant of Domain definition require a closer look at the characteristics of target language use task and the involvement of critical knowledge, skills and abilities. To better capture the characteristics of target domain of language use, a genre analysis of the multi-model activities in real life should be conducted (Cross, 2011). For example, only showing a talking head in a lecture video would be a mis-presentation of real-class because it limits testtakers’ use of critical visual-related skills in a real-life situation.
Since the warrant to Domain definition is mainly about the identification of tasks in target domain and the match of the characteristics between target language use tasks and test tasks, in this sense, the traditional concept of situational authenticity fits well in my discussion of video-based listening tests.
4. 2. Situational authenticity
The importance of authenticity is also reflected in Bachman and Palmer’s framework of test usefulness, in which authenticity is listed as one of the six key qualities of language tests, the others being reliability, construct validity, interactiveness, impact and practicality (Bachman & Palmer,1996). Authenticity is thought to be closely related with construct validity, especially when the construct is mainly defined with reference to task characteristics. However, the term authenticity itself needs to be clearly defined before being used for any claims in language testing field.
In the developmental process of language testing theory, the importance of authenticity emerged with the advent of communicative language teaching and subsequently communicative language testing practice. In the book Fundamental Considerations in Language Assessment, Bachman (1990) categorized “authenticity” into two types, situational authenticity and interactional authenticity. Situational authenticity reflects the characteristics resemblance between test tasks and TLU tasks. Interactional authenticity refers to the similarity of the interaction elicited by test tasks and TLU tasks. This dual notion of authenticity has been appraised by many researchers, such as Buck, Douglas, and Lewkowicz. Later, Bachman and Palmer (1996) kept the term “authenticity” for “situational authenticity” and coined a new term “interactiveness” for interactional authenticity in their framework of test usefulness. Authenticity in that framework retains the nature of

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 61-82 69
situational authenticity and is defined as “the degree to which a given language test’s tasks’ characteristics correspond to a TLU task’s features” (Bachman & Palmer, 1996, p. 23). This is the notion that has been widely used in support of video listening test research and practices. In Bachman and Palmer’s framework of test usefulness, the new category of “interactiveness” replaces the concept of interactional authenticity. Bachman and Palmer intended to raise the importance of authenticity and interactiveness in relation to construct validity. However, there are some unexpected consequences from this further differentiation. As questioned by Lewokoicz (2000), this change could be misleading to some researchers who may neglect the interactional side of authenticity when they use the term of authenticity in their argument. In the existing studies of video listening test, the notion of authenticity has been limited to situational authenticity only. For example, in defending the use of video in listening tests, Wagner (2006) posited that videos can help recreate real-life context in listening tests and the requirement of authenticity should “dictate” test design, thus helping build up construct validity.
While situational authenticity has been acknowledged as an important factor in the overall quality of a test, there are some aspects that should not be overlooked. First, authenticity should be regarded as a continuum. Therefore, the question of how authentic a test task should be is always there. Take the relationship between language teaching and testing as an example, there are always some gaps in the use of authentic linguistic materials and tasks between language teaching and testing practices. In ESL classes, students can communicate with others in a face-to-face manner and they can negotiate meaning when listening comprehension problem occurs. In video-mediated language classes, students usually have control over video materials or multimedia and in addition, in the context of computer assisted language learning (CALL) learners can resort to help from both internal and external resources, such as online dictionary, closed captions, lexical annotations and so on. These are regular authentic activities in and outside ESL classes. However, it is not very possible by now to incorporate these real-life technological aids to testing situations, where listening tasks are still mainly designed in the form of one-way information conveying and no clarification seeking from test-takers is allowed.
Second, situational authenticity has been an area where test-takers’ voice is rarely made heard. Even authenticity has been frequently mentioned in various theoretical descriptions of language assessment, there are only a few empirical studies on the perception of authenticity in actual test projects. In a comparative study of a traditional English test and an EAP (English for Academic Purposes) test which resembled subject class activities in a Hong Kong university, Lewkowicz (2000) reported on a mismatch of test

70 Z. Li
authenticity perceptions by different stake holders, including test-takers and language test developer. In this study, 72 first-year college students at Hong Kong, who were familiar with both test formats, showed a preference of the traditional English test which adopted multiple-choice question format over the EAP test which was featured with integrated, performance test tasks. Lewkowicz pointed out that authenticity in her study was regarded as less important by test-takers than test developer thought. In a discussion of authenticity, Spencer-Brown (2001) also claimed that not all the stakeholders perceive authenticity in the same way. From her own research on a course based assessment of Japanese language, Spencer-Brown went further to suggest that test-takers’ view authenticity differently from other stakeholders, such as subject course instructors.
Likewise, the effort of using video to boost authenticity in listening tests has been perceived differently as shown in existing studies. Progosh (1996) asserted that the majority of Japanese college students in his comparative study of video and audio listening tests showed their preference of video listening test over audio one. In a post-video listening test questionnaire Wagner (2010a) found that in general test-takers held a positive attitude toward video listening test. Most of their responses to a set of seven 5-point scale items were over three, the centerpoint. But, test-takers in Wagner’s study seemed to be uncertain about the effect of visuals in the test as their response to the statement “I scored higher on the test because I was able to see the speaker (in the video lecturette)” was “markedly lower at 2.98” (p.287). In a study of teacher certification test in Hong Kong, however, Coniam (2001) noticed that the participants in audio-only listening test group expressed interest in taking video listening test while the participants in video listening test group complained about the distraction from videos and said they would have performed better in the audio-only test. Suvorov (2008) found that nearly half of 34 ESL test-takers in his study claimed to prefer the audio-only test over either the photograph-mediated listening test or the video test.
Therefore, when the term authenticity is used in support of using videos in listening tests, two aspects of situational authenticity should be considered: the degree of TLU task simulation and test stake-holders’ perception of authenticity, especially test-takers’ perception. Otherwise, the argument of using videos in listening tests for the sake of authenticity may not hold.
5. Explanation inference
Explanation inference reflects the connection of test performance with theoretical construct in video-based listening tests. The warrant to this inference is that expected scores are attributed to a construct of listening

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 61-82 71
comprehension in its broader sense. In this section, the approaches to construct definition and the interactional authenticity are discussed.
5. 1. Construct definition
Traditionally, listening itself has been recognized as the ability to decode aural input with little attention given to visuals (Gruba, 2004). Although there is no widely agreed definition of listening construct, most researchers would accept the view of listening comprehension as a dynamic inference processing of the incoming information, including aural as well as visual information (Buck, 2001; Dunkel, Henning, & Chaudron, 1998; Taylor & Geranpayeh, 2011). Apart from audios as the defining characteristics of listening comprehension, non-verbal information, such as body language, facial expressions, kinesics, and so on, has been acknowledged as an important component in real-life listening activities and thus it has attracted much attention in the field of listening teaching in (Guichon & McLoran, 2008; Harris, 2003; Lynch, 2009; Sueyoshi & Hardison, 2005; Ruhe, 1996). This recognition of non-verbal information is also reflected in the involvement of videos in listening tests. To accommodate this change, the construct of videobased listening tests should be reconsidered (Ockey, 2007).
The construct of a test is the trait to be measured. Defining a construct in a theoretically sound and practically operationalizable way has been the top priority in language test development. There are two basic approaches to construct definition, namely, competence-based approach and task-based approach (Buck, 2001; Chapelle, 1998). Competence-based approach treats test performance consistency as a result of test-takers’ underlying knowledge and ability. This approach emphasizes test-takers’ characteristics and their cognitive processes in tests. The construct defined in this approach can be operationalized as sub-skill taxonomy in test specifications (Song, 2008). However, listening comprehension is a highly complex cognitive process and can only be assessed indirectly. The major problem in this approach lies in the difficulty in matching specified underlying skills with particular test tasks. In other words, it is not easy to guarantee that the required competence is tapped by items as designed (Buck, 2001).
On the other hand, task-based approach to construct definition attributes test performance consistency to situational factors and characteristics of testtasks. Testers who advocate this approach usually stress copying real-life task characteristics and value authenticity because what kind of tasks test-takers can perform and under what circumstances are the immediate concern to them (Buck, 2001). However, the task-based approach runs a risk of underrepresenting test content and task characteristics because of the immense diversity in target language use (TLU) tasks. Even in tests of language for

72 Z. Li
specific purposes (LSP), capturing and simulating characteristics of TLU tasks are very challenging (Douglas, 2000).
Considering the merits and drawbacks of these two approaches, both Buck (2001) and Chapelle (1998) advocate an eclectic position: the interactionalist approach to construct definition. This approach embraces the characteristics of test-takers and test tasks, and their interactions. Following this line, Jamieson, Eignor, Grabe, and Kunnan (2008) emphasized three aspects in the design of new TOEFL listening test, namely, abilities, task type and text type. Likewise, Taylor and Geranpayeh (2011) proposed a socio-cognitive framework for testing academic listening, which consists of test-taker characteristics, external contextual factors, and internal cognitive processing. Taylor and Geranpayeh drew on psycholinguistic research findings and posited that listening cognitive processing covers a series of cognitive activities, including acoustic/visual input decoding. This interactionalist view of construct seems very appropriate in test development. However, the concern in this approach is how to balance the competence and task sides of construct definition as they reflect different philosophies (Buck, 2001; Chapelle, 1998). More importantly, the inherent problems in each approach do not disappear in such a combined fashion.
One of the concerns in video-based listening tests is where to categorize visual-related abilities in a competence-based listening construct which conventionally focuses on listening comprehension ability exclusively due to the influence of traditional tests of the four individual linguistic skills (listening, reading, speaking, and writing). In other words, listening tests have been made in a way to minimize contextual influence and there is no room for visual-related abilities in the construct of listening tests (Buck, 2001). In responding to this concern, Wagner (2008) argued that the ability of using visual information should be subsumed under the category of pragmatic knowledge in Purpura’s definition of grammatical ability for testing purpose. Purpura’s notion of pragmatic knowledge covers a series of elements: knowledge of contextual meaning, sociolinguistic meaning, sociocultural meaning, psychological meaning and rhetorical meaning (Purpura, 2004). Nevertheless, Wagner’s suggestion actually begs the question of the role of visual-related ability in the construct of listening comprehension.
Undoubtedly, the inclusion of visual-related ability will make the competence-based construct even more difficult to operationalize in actual test projects. This is because when videos are used in listening tests, visual literacy, the ability to decode visual information, have to be included as a part of listening construct (Ockey, 2007), which could be very problematic due to the complex nature of visual literacy itself (Gruba, 1997). As previous studies on visual literacy show, learners may differ in their ability to interpret visual

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 61-82 73
cues and their perceptual habits of visual information could be conditioned by specific cultures (Gruba, 1997). As indicated in some educational studies, some learners may benefit more from their exposure to visual modes, whereas some learners can make better progress with other non-visual modes (Stokes, 2002). Visual learning style has also been discussed by Ellis (2008) as one of the common learning styles in second language acquisition. Up till now, there are only few empirical studies on the effect of visual literacy level on second language listening comprehension. The studies on effects of still images in language tests confirmed that different visual types do have different influence on test-takers’ performance. In a speaking testing research conducted by Xi (2005), test-takers were required to describe graphs (bar chart with various visual chunks). Her research results indicated that graph familiarity affected test-takers’ performance on graph description tasks. Based on this finding, Xi asserted that graph familiarity presents a constructirrelevant source in the speaking test. Xi’s findings are also echoed in Ockey (2007) and Wagner (2008) as they found their participants engaged with visual information differently and benefited differently from visual information. Therefore, visual-related skills or visual literacy should be considered in construct definition because they are inevitably a part of the competence tapped by video-based tasks. In this sense, some measures should be taken to control for the variable of test-takers’ visual literacy to achieve fairness in video-based listening tests.
As for the concern in task-based construct definition, the ultimate goal of mirroring TLU tasks itself is not quite achievable (Douglas, 2000). Bachman and Palmer (1996) have proposed a framework of task characteristics to guide test-task design. However, defining TLU tasks, on the other hand, is a sampling process in nature considering the vast number of characteristics related to real-life target language use. For example, in tests of language for academic purposes, the degree of visual involvement varies across academic activities and disciplines. Even the visual aids used by lecturers, such as PowerPoint slides, videos, and so on, can be dramatically varied in terms of format, content and use frequency (Buck, 2001; Lynch, 2011). Likewise, in establishing a validity argument for new TOEFL test, Jamieson et al.(2008) admitted that the consideration of situation aspect of task created a “long list of variables rather than many actual tasks for the test” (p.66).
Given the fact of wide use of videos in language classrooms and ubiquitous presence of visual modes in real-life communication, theoretically, videos or other visuals should be incorporated into listening construct definition as an input characteristic of tasks. However, the aforementioned problems of each construct definition approach call into question the endeavor of using video in listening test. More research is needed to investigate to what extent videos should be used in listening tests and what role videos can play in listening

construct.
5. 2. Interactional authenticity
Compared with situational authenticity, the interactional authenticity of test tasks attracts less attention in language testing research. Nevertheless, its importance has been recognized by some researchers (Buck, 2001; Douglas, 2000; Lewkowicz, 2000). As Buck rightly pointed out,
When making test tasks, the important thing is not that the test task is similar to the target language use tasks, but the interaction between the test-taker and the test task is similar to the interaction between language user and the target language use situation (Buck, 2001, p.108).
The role of interactional authenticity of test tasks is also highlighted by Weir (2005) in his concept of ‘cognitive validity’ which addresses the same concern of the interactional authenticity of test tasks. Cognitive validity refers to the extent to which the language processes induced by test material resemble those that would occur in a natural context (Weir, 2005). Therefore, we should go beyond situational authenticity and investigate test-taking process to reveal how test-takers interact with visual input in actual tests. Ideally, test-takers’ interaction with test tasks should be compared with that in TLU tasks.
Nevertheless, there are some difficulties in understanding interactional authenticity in video-based listening tests. Admittedly, there is a dearth of established research on the actual interaction with TLU tasks and consequently, a valid comparison of the interactive process with test tasks and with TLU tasks is not easy to make. Gruba (2004) proposed a sevencategory framework of videotext comprehension, in which different roles of visual information are identified from a series of immediately retrospective verbal reports by learners of Japanese after watching three authentic Japanese news broadcasts. Based on a constructivist view of listening comprehension, Gruba characterized the roles of visual elements as “identify text type”, “initiate macrostructure”, “ generate tentative hypothesis related to an initial macrostructure”, “confirm interpretation”, “constrain, or refine, an interpretation”, “hinder macrostructure development”, and “provide little assistance”. Gruba posited that visual elements do not just function as supportive information and he called for more attention to learners’ media literacy development in language classrooms. Although Gruba’s framework was derived from the news report video genre, his distinction of video roles can, to some extent, be applied to video listening test. It follows that in videobased listening tests interaction process should also be studied to make sure videos have been attended to in a way similar as in TLU tasks.

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 61-82 75
As mentioned earlier, the conflicting findings of visual input effects on listening test performances suggest that test-takers may perform differently in various video-based listening tests. In the existing studies of video-based listening tests, Ockey (2007) and Wagner (2007, 2010a) are the few studies that investigated test-takers’ interaction with videos and test tasks. They asked a similar question: how did test-takers watch the videos in listening test? In Ockey’s study, two computer-based parallel listening tests were designed with a major difference in visual presentation, one was presented in video and another was mediated through five still images from the same video lecture on American politics. Through observations, retrospective verbal reports and interviews with six ESL college student participants, Ockey (2007) found that in still image-mediated listening test, participants only attended to the first few still images and then tended to ignore the other images, but in video listening test their engagement with videos varied greatly in terms of the time spent on videos, ranging from 2.5% to 73.6%. Some of the participants spent very limited time on videos, which means that some of them barely interacted with the visual information. Meanwhile, the helpfulness of visuals was perceived differently by the participants.
Wagner (2007), however, revealed a different pattern of interaction with visuals in his study of a video listening test, which consisted of six videotexts: three being lecturette videos and the other three being dialogue videos. Wagner videotaped the test-taking process of 36 ESL students in a non-credit bearing ESL class and found that test-takers watched videos intensively. As the videotape of test-taking process showed, test takers oriented themselves to the video screen for an average of 69% of video playing time and demonstrated some consistency in viewing behaviors among the 36 ESL testtakers. In another study by Wagner (2010a), he administered a shortened video listening test (two lecturette and two dialogues) to 56 ESL students who were enrolled in a pre-academic intensive English program at an American university. Like in Wagner (2007), test-takers’ viewing behavior was videotaped and their eye gaze at the screen was quantified. Analysis results indicated that test-takers spent 47% of the time on video screens in the video listening test, which is much lower than the average viewing time in his previous study. Also, the time test-takers engaged with videos varied greatly among test-takers, as well as across video types (lecturette vs. dialogue). Interestingly, the relationship between viewing time and test performance was only negatively correlated. Wagner speculated that this could be attributed to the viewing behavior of lower ability learners because they might watch videos more often as a compensatory strategy (Wagner, 2010a, p.289).
Test-takers’ viewing behavior differences found in the mentioned studies can be partly accounted for from the perspective of the very nature of language

tests (Lewkowicz, 2000; Spencer-Brown, 2001). Test is a test. It is never the same as a regular learning activity no matter how closely it mirrors TLU tasks. Spolsky (1985) commented similarly on this aspect of authenticity. He maintained that the test tasks actually have a set of different rules compared with non-test tasks, requiring test-takers to display their knowledge and skills, as a result, the simulation of real-life tasks cannot elicit genuine interaction. Along the same lines, Taylor and Geranpayeh remind us in their comments on the use of video in listening tests that
Though there may be a strong ecological argument in favor of using modern technology in our tests to simulate real-life lecture listening, there are obvious constraints on how far this reality can be achieved or should even be pursued. On the one hand, visual cues (e.g. facial expression, gesture and PowerPoint slides) might be seen as supplying information not present in an audio recording; on the other hand, the requirement to heed those cues and also to note-taking might be seen as imposing a heavier cognitive load than a straightforward audio test (Taylor & Geranpayeh, 2011, p. 99).
From these studies, a tentative conclusion can be drawn that videos are at least used by some test-takers in video-based listening tests. However, we are not sure whether videos were viewed in a similar way as in TLU tasks. In addition, there are only limited visual information was reported in test-taking processes in Ockey (2007) and Wagner (2008), compared with the framework of visual elements proposed by Gruba (2004). Obviously, it is true that video inputs are treated differently by different test-takers and the benefits from visual inputs also vary from person to person. The inclusion of video in listening tests may bring more variation to video-based listening tests and thus undermine the construct validity and cause fairness issue. Therefore, more empirical studies on test-taking processes are needed to establish the interactional authenticity of video-based listening tests.
6. Conclusion
Read (2002) once predicted that “for practical as much as for more principled reasons, listening tests with only auditory input will continue to have a prominent role for the foreseeable future” (p. 108). Responding to Read, Lynch (2011) contended that “it is becoming increasingly difficult to justify academic listening assessment (and research) based on audio-only input, of the type that has been the norm” (p. 86). Indeed, videos have been experimented and used in some low-stakes in-house placement tests. The earlier technological barrier and cost factor in video listening test development seem to be less intimidating with the rapid development of computer technology and increased availability of video materials. However,

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 61-82 77
there are still two key concerns that need to be considered for a defensible use of video in listening tests.
First, the construct of video-based listening tests needs to be well defined to accommodate visual-related skills or visual literacy, and to sample representative TLU tasks in which visuals are involved. On the one hand, if videos are used in listening test, visual literacy will inevitably be a part of the construct. Some measures to control for visual literacy as a confounding variable should be taken to ensure that visual-related skills do not override listening skills. On the other hand, the representativeness of test task in video-based listening tests should be further considered because the TLU tasks themselves may be different in degrees of visual involvement. Second, as for the frequently used term of authenticity in support of video-based listening tests, more considerations should be given to both situational authenticity and interactional authenticity of test tasks, which appear to be questionable in video-based listening tests.
Going back to the structure of interpretive argument for video-based listening test as shown in Figure 1, a systematic research agenda on video-based listening tests can be outlined. For example, needs analysis and multi-modal analysis of target language use will be needed in the Domain definition for initial test development and validation studies. Scoring rubric and item or testlet level statistical analyses will provide support or rebuttal to the assumptions underlying Evaluation inference. For Generalization inference, a series of reliability studies, including generalizability studies on item effect, should be planned out. For Explanation inference, test-takers’ cognitive process in video-based listening tests should be investigated. The study on the internal structure of video-based listening test can shed light on the comparison of traditional audio-only listening test and video-based listening tests. In addition, differential item functioning (DIF) studies should be conducted to detect possible bias from video-mediated items and group differences (Karami & Salmani Nodoushan, 2011). For Extrapolation inference, criterion-related validity studies are needed. Utilization inference, the last inference of test scores, calls for standard-setting studies and washback studies on the use of video-based listening tests.
With the influence of current theories of communicative language assessment and performance assessment in general, we can anticipate more and more attention to be devoted to simulating TLU tasks. Naturally, videos will surely play an important role in defining task and situational characteristics in listening tests. In future research on video-based listening tests more process-oriented studies are needed to reveal the role of visual literacy in the construct of listening comprehension. In addition, different video types should be studied in listening test contexts to find out the interaction of visual

literacy with different visual types. Furthermore, new task types should be experimented, including test interface design, to promote interactional authenticity of test tasks.

Two-folded messages behind CFP: A cross disciplinary study
Wen Hsien YANG, National Kaohsiung University of Hospitality and Tourism, Taiwan
Much research on analysing generic structure and linguistic features in academic settings mainly focuses on a single genre, but the structures of inter-related genres have been relatively less systematically studied. ‘Call for papers’ (CFP), as one of the ignitions in a genre chain of academic texts, could play a rather crucial role in affecting prospective contributors’ attention and also determining the quality of submissions. However, compared to the studies on research papers, studying textures of CFP has received relatively little attention from analysts. Thus, in this study 120 CFP were collected from various academic conferences in six disciplines on the Internet, and were compared to examine whether any disciplinary variations existed in terms of the unique schematic structure and lexical features of this genre employed by writers in both the hard and soft sciences. A manual multi-level move analysis and computerised analysis of textual elements were used. Subtle variations in CFP were identified between the two major science areas.

1. Introduction
For the past few decades, genre analysis of academic texts has gained much attention and thus the production and publication of it are many. For instance, some genre analysts have investigated the generic structures and linguistic features of the titles, abstracts, introductions, results, discussions and conclusions in research journal articles, while others have focused on analysing genres of presentations and papers in academic conferences such as paper titles, conference paper abstracts, speech acts in presentations, written texts in poster presentations, and oral presentations delivered by English native speakers and non-native speakers, or affected by cultural factors. Most of these analyses involve the production of disciplinary knowledge. However, lately researchers’ focus on genre analysis has attended to the distribution of knowledge, in particular, those academic genres

embedded with promotional, persuasive and/or evaluative purposes. Backcover blurbs (Gea Valor & Inigo Ros, 2009; Gesuato, 2007), publishers’ descriptions (Giannoni, 2009), book review (Salmani Nodoushan & Montazeran, 2012) and journal descriptions (Hyland & Tse, 2009, 2010) all fall into this category. The importance of these so-called ‘carrier genres’ lies in the fact that they play an indispensable role in the mechanisms of delivering and promoting authors’/editors’ expectations to their potential readers or contributors (Giannonni, 2001), and in “staking out a specific territory which it can then claim to uniquely occupy” (Hyland & Tse, 2010, p. 22). Yet, one genre with a similar purpose is relatively less attended to and researched, that is, Call for Papers (CFP) for academic conferences, an initiating genre of genre chains (Swales, 2004) eliciting the generation of the following communicative events in conferences.
It is argued that CFP, like the descriptions in research journals (Hyland & Tse, 2010), play an important role in positioning the conference in a particular field and in the consciousness of the members of a community. The members of the discourse community which uses CFP include the academic conference committee, people working in the field, postgraduate students, sponsors, and others who are highly motivated to participate and who have a suitable degree of relevant content knowledge and field expertise. Though usually CFP writers may enjoy higher scholastic reputations and academic power than their readers, due to the implicit purpose of promoting, they have to keep a well-balanced position between maintaining knowledge and expanding the number of potential participants. Hence, writers of CFP need to exercise carefully-structured moves and precisely-chosen linguistic features to conform to academic conventions and to accurately deliver their expectations to potential contributors/readers. In addition, the communicative purposes of CFP are also evident and multi-faceted namely, informative, persuasive and promotional. CFP not only call for wider contributions or participation, but also describe how the field has developed and provide a sufficient account of this development to convince readers of the importance of calling for papers to visit the proposed issues. Thus, CFP, embedded with their specific layout features, the generic construction, the communication medium, and the language systems, describe the present development of the discourse community, motivate prospective contributors to join the communicative events, and persuade them of the benefits of contributing to the field of knowledge to achieve the multiple purposes of communication. Hence, analysing CFP with a genre-analytic approach cannot only help further unveil the less-exploited genres of distributing disciplinary knowledge but promote the success of text writing (Salmani Nodoushan & Khakbaz, 2011).
Though Yang (2012a) has made the first attempt to identify the structural moves and linguistic choices of CFP by using sampled texts in one discipline,

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 83-108 85
namely, applied linguistics, the present study broadens its scope to include CFP from various science areas to compare and contrast the diversities of structural constructions and linguistic realisations across different disciplines. It is believed that variations in disciplines reflect different epistemological and social practices, which inevitably affect the construction of texts in a genre and the employment of unique language across disciplines (Cava, 2011). Hence, rather than relying on one prototypicality, “discipline variation is much more significant than allowed for in the original work on genre analysis” (Dudley-Evans, 2000, p. 9). To be specific, this research focuses on the following questions:
1. What are the moves of effective CFP for announcing academic conferences across discipline variations?
2. What are the lexical features employed in CFP to represent the authorship and keyness in academic conferences across discipline variations?
2. Background
Generally, CFP can be defined as a genre because they usually follow certain conventions and regularities which affect information processing in a recurrent manner and thus make their forms, functions and contexts of communication predictable and understandable (Santini, Mehler & Sharoff, 2010). Yet, CFP are a very unique text type compared to other written texts in terms of their formation, medium of delivery, and purpose, which makes it equivocal to position or categorise absolutely which genre CFP belong to. CFP share similar features with at least the following genres: formulaic genre, persuasive and evaluative academic genre, commercial promotional genre, and digital/Internet/Web1 genre.
It is clear that CFP conventionally follow a particular formula of construction. Like other formulaic genres such as editorials or engagement notices in newspapers or sports commentaries on TV, CFP depend on external exigencies such as structure, and internal regularities such as linguistic properties, to accomplish their communicative functions or purposes (Kuiper, 2009). Though genres usually exhibit stability due to their emergence over a period of time and reinforcement within situations (Yates & Orlikowski, 1992), they can still be dynamic and open to change and cross boundaries to include characteristics from different genres (Bhatia, 2002; Guenther & Knoblauch, 1995; Rahimi, 2011; Santini et al., 2010). They allow for variations across ideologies, ontology, epistemology, geographical locations, socio-
1 The terms, digital, the Web and the Internet genre, are regarded as the same and are used interchangeably in the present study.

86 W. H. Yang
cultural norms and expectations, peoples and time (Kuiper, 2009). Various discipline areas such as the hard and soft sciences can hold different beliefs and attitudes towards the existence of reality and the knowledge of essence. Thus, it is assumed that these ideological diversities between the two main science areas may have an impact on the construction of a single genre such as CFP.
CFP for academic conferences, without a doubt, have their persuasive and evaluative functions of distributing knowledge, but the process of distribution to attract a wider contribution or participation also implicitly connects to promotional purposes, as with other commercial publications. Journal descriptions (JD), as analysed by Hyland and Tse (2009, 2010), share similar functions with CFP. Differing from other academic texts which mainly produce knowledge, JD distribute knowledge as a carrier genre. Descriptions in journals specify how the editors position their journals and what they expect from their contributors, and offer readers information about their aims, scope, and readership. A JD provides “the editor’s evaluation of both the journal and the field it helps construct, identifying the key features of the publication and the position it occupies in the disciplinary firmament” (Hyland & Tse, 2009, p. 704), and it “acts dialogistically to maintain relations with readers and invokes or recognizes particular positions to persuade them to see things in a certain way” (p. 708). Besides, its promotional messages are implicitly realised by stating types of submissions and acceptable style in a mutually respectful way. Hence, the language used cannot be too subjective or as obviously promotional as business promotional genres (see examples in Bhatia, 2002; Cheung, 2008; Henry & Roseberry, 2001; Kong, 2009; Lien, 2008; Yang, 2011, 2012b) or other academic promotional genres such as personal statements, grant proposals or application letters (see Asher, 2000; Ding, 2007; Sii, 2004). Similarly, CFP also share the above features with JD. However, unlike the above genres, CFP enjoy a relatively broader coverage of readership as they are always distributed worldwide through the Web, and thus it is difficult to target their specific audience. This would supposedly make writers of CFP more cautious in employing moves and strategies and exercising linguistic components in order to keep a neutral tone but still with informative and promotional purposes.
In the present digital era, many traditional publications have been transformed into digital formats and publicised on the Internet, and the emergence of this new media has brought about great changes to genre repertoires (Yates & Orlikowski, 1992). The Internet has not only modified the traditional genres and given rise to new ones, but the texts and functionalities of digital genres are constantly evolving with the advance of technology (Crowston & Williams, 1997; Toms, 2000). Differing from traditional written genres, web genres enact a new communication setting

International Journal of Language Studies, 7(2), 83-108 87
that reconfigures the situations in which pragmatic features of language respond (Giltrow & Stein, 2009). Currently, nearly every CFP is announced and circulated with the help of the Internet. As such, the Internet has become a fairly important medium for publishing CFP, and the features of the Web can presumably regulate how CFP should be formed and constructed in order to meet conventions of dialogue on the Internet and the expectations of netusers. Thus, web CFP might be expected to be embedded with the characteristics of interactivity, multimodality and dynamic context in line with other web documents (Santini et al., 2010).
Yet, CFP seemingly cannot be simply classified as one of the web genres. As a new global medium, the Internet has greatly changed the directions of communicating and delivering knowledge, and one of its recognisable features is to allow for synchronised communication and co-authorship such as in Weblogs, encyclopaedias, book reviews or newspapers. However, most CFP currently apparently still lack this greater fluidity and pragmatic openness (Giltrow & Stein, 2009), though they do rely on some of the benefits of using the Internet as a medium, such as hyperlink features, large storage of messages, speedy circulation, tailor-made interface or multiple channels for contribution (Luzon, 2007; Cheung, 2008). In contrast to traditional paperbased CFP, computer-mediated CFP involve many more language issues than simply technology. The language used in digital discourse also reflects the ideology, contexts, and political economies of access and power where texts are created (Thurlow & Mroczek, 2011) and is influentially shaped by a number of factors such as technological, situational, and linguistic variables (Herring, 2004a). Besides, Cheung (2008) also argues that the Internet would not only influence the overall interactional or social strategies of informing and promoting, but pose new challenges to the structure and presentation of academic promotional genres. Hence, it is assumed that on-line CFP can potentially be different from traditional printed ones in terms of their structure and linguistic components, and variations across disciplines may also cause diversities internally.
Judging from the above review, rather than being viewed as a pure genre, CFP would be better to be categorised as an instance of a hybrid genre, a genre embedded and mixed with features of other genres (Bhatia, 2002), in particular, the on-line CFP characterised by the construction of both text and many other multimedia or user-interfaces (Herring, 2010). However, compared to the large amount of genre analysis of academic texts, their interrelated or sub genres such as CFP have received relatively little attention (Samraj, 2005). In addition, even though a great deal of language in an increasing number of texts is available on the Internet, many web genres such as on-line CFP are still underrepresented (Santini et al., 2010). However, by collecting 40 on-line CFP from the discipline of English language teaching in

applied linguistics, Yang’s (2012a) pilot study established an initial 6-move structure of CFP (i.e., Drawing attention, Identifying the discourse community coverage, Soliciting contributions, Presenting incentives for participation, Clarifying miscellanea and Signing off), and argued that the promotional purposes of CFP are rather implicit and embedded with informative messages and social events due to the nature of the audience. To better generalise Yang’s model and to investigate the variable of whether disciplines with different ideological, ontological and epistemological beliefs and values would affect structure and linguistic choices in CFP, the present study broadens its sampling size by collecting CFP on the Internet from different disciplines, and attempts to compare and contrast the hard and soft science disciplines.

3. Method

3.1. Corpus
Data for this research project were collected from the Internet. All of the 120 CFP texts came from a conference alert Website (www.conferencealert.com), and all conferences were held or were planned to be held in either 2012 or 2013. In order to compare and contrast the move structures of the two main science areas, the texts were selected purposefully based on the following procedure. Firstly, according to their disciplines, all the conferences listed were categorised into the two main sciences, namely, the soft and hard sciences. Next, three major areas of each science were randomly chosen. Thus, the hard sciences included conferences about physical and life science (PLS), health and medicine (HMD), and engineering and technology (EET) while the soft sciences included conferences about law and interdisciplinary fields (LID), education (EDU), and social sciences and humanities (SSH). In addition, only those conferences with an international scope and held in English-speaking countries (the US, the UK and Canada only) were adopted. Twenty conferences in each of the six areas were decided on; hence, in total 120 CFP were collected, serving as the corpus of this study, as shown in Table 1.

The purposes of sampling only the authentic texts chosen mainly aimed to avoid, firstly, the varieties of English language used by native speakers and

non-native speakers, which can be regarded as a small culture, and secondly to obviate the possibility of socio-cultural influences in non-Anglo-Saxon contexts, which is defined as a kind of large culture by geographical setting (Holliday, 1999). These criteria of selecting texts helped focus the present research on investigating the issues at the level of discipline variation only.
3.2. Analysis
The present study adopted the methods of hand-tagged move-analysis and computerised analysis of lexical features, which are extensively used in analysing a personal promotional genre (Ding, 2007; Henry & Roseberry, 2001; Upton & Connor, 2001). A three-tier method was developed for this study. Firstly, Yang’s (2012a) model of establishing the move structure of CFP based on the discipline of applied linguistics was used as the initial framework to generate the possible move structures by using 16% of the present corpus in both science areas. Secondly, to identify more possibilities of moves in various disciplines, the discourse markers used in the texts were located, as they are considered to provide clues to divide the texts and make them meaningful units (Connor & Maureanen, 1999). The textual markers used to identify the moves in this study include connectors, section boundaries, paragraph divisions, subheadings and hyperlinks in the CFP. Major section boundaries and some hyperlinks helped generate the moves, while sub-headings, connectors, paragraph divisions, column chunks or some hyperlinks facilitated the identification of the steps following a main move. Then, the occurrences of both the newly-identified and Yang’s original moves/steps in the current corpus were manually categorised by the researcher and a research assistant. The inter-coder reliability between the two coders reached 88.5% (agreed steps/ total steps in a selected 10% of the corpus). Third, with the help of the concordance software, WordSmith Tools (Scott, 2008), the wordlist and keyword lists as well as collocations in the texts were generated, which helped in the categorisation of the CFP into distinct moves/steps (Ding, 2007). In other words, the present study attempted to research the genre of CFP from both macro and micro perspectives, namely, their move structures and linguistic features.
4. Results and discussion
4.1. Subtle variations in CFP structure across disciplines
With reference to Yang’s (2012a) preliminary model, the present analysis attempts to complement the generic structure of CFP to a higher generalizability. Due to the broader representation of the corpus, more steps were identified in the present study. The newly-proposed move/step structure and their explanations are listed in Figure 1.

Step 5.2 Supplying contextualized notices Step 5.3 Suggesting Websites/multimedia (This
includes photo gallery and videos, etc.)

State notices which are not directly related to academic events Thank people and organizations who offer help or resources Remind about other supplementary issues to attend to Encourage readers to visit Websites/multimedia addons for more information

Move 6: Signing off

Express best wishes and expectations of meeting at the conference

a Note: a Steps in italics are newly-added in the present study. b Please refer to Yang (2012a) for examples of moves/steps

Figure 1. New framework of Call for papers’ moves/steps and definitions.

In total, six major recurrent moves, as in the original structure (Yang, 2012a), were confirmed again, but a number of sub-steps, which were not proposed
