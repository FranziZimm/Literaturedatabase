This second edition of the landmark textbook Reading Images builds on its reputation as the ﬁrst systematic and comprehensive account of the grammar of visual design. Drawing on an enormous range of examples from children’s drawings to textbook illustrations, photo-journalism to ﬁne art, as well as three-dimensional forms such as sculpture and toys, the authors examine the ways in which images communicate meaning.
Features of this fully updated second edition include:
• new material on moving images and on colour • a discussion of how images and their uses have changed
through time • websites and web-based images • ideas on the future of visual communication.
Reading Images focuses on the structures or ‘grammar’ of visual design – colour, perspective, framing and composition – and provides the reader with an invaluable ‘tool-kit’ for reading images, which makes it a must for anyone interested in communication, the media and the arts.

Praise for the
first edition
‘Reading Images is the most important book in visual communication since Jacques Bertin’s semiology of information graphics. It is both thorough and thoughtprovoking; a remarkable breakthrough.’
Kevin G. Barnhurst, Syracuse University, USA
‘Fresh and stimulating. The sociocentric approach is by far the most penetrating approach to the subject currently available.’
Paul Cobley, London Guildhall University
‘A useful text for all students who are involved in areas which rely on both language and visual images for their expression and articulation of ideas.’
Catriona Scott, Middlesex University
‘This is the best detailed and sustained development of the “social semiotic” approach to the analysis of visuals. Clear, informative and theoretically developmental.’
Dr S. Cottle, Bath HE College

Preface to the second edition
The ﬁrst edition of Reading Images has had a positive reception among a wide group from the professions and disciplines which have to deal with real problems and real issues involving images. This has gone along with a broader agenda of concern with ‘multimodality’, a rapidly growing realization that representation is always multiple. We do not think for a moment that this book represents anything like a settled approach, a deﬁnitive ‘grammar’ of images, and at times we have been worried by attempts to treat it in that way. We see it as an early attempt, one among many others, and we would like to see it treated very much as a resource for beginning to make inroads into understanding the visual as representation and communication – in a semiotic fashion – and also as a resource in the development of theories and ‘grammars’ of visual communication. In that spirit we want to stress that we see everything we have written here simultaneously as our fully serious and yet entirely provisional sense of this ﬁeld.
When we completed the ﬁrst edition of this book we were aware of a number of ‘omissions’ – things we felt still needed doing. Some of these we have taken up in other ways, for instance in our attempt to develop a theory of multimodality; others we have tried to address in this second edition. Foremost among these have been the quite different issues of the moving image and of colour. The ﬁrst of these has been constantly raised by those who have used the book, and rightly so. We hope that what we have said here can begin to integrate the ﬁeld of moving images into our social semiotic approach to visual communication. The issue of colour was less frequently raised, yet constituted for us a kind of theoretical test case, as much to do with the issue of colour itself as to do with a theory of multimodal social semiotics much more widely considered. Here, too, we feel that we have provided just a ﬁrst attempt for a different approach. In addition we have added a number of new examples from CD-ROMs and websites, domains of visual communication that had hardly begun to develop when we wrote the ﬁrst edition, and are now of central importance for many users of this book.
One persistent criticism of the ﬁrst edition from a group of readers has been that the book was (too) linguistic. The ﬁrst comment we would make is to say that for us ‘formality’ in the domain of representation is not in any way the same as ‘being linguistic’. So to some extent we think that that criticism rests on that kind of misunderstanding. We also think that there is a difference between explicitness and formality. We certainly have aimed for the former, and often (but not always) for the latter. Nor do we think that either explicitness or formality are the enemies of innovation, creativity, imagination: often all these latter rest on the former. It is the case that our starting point has been the systemic functional grammar of English developed by Michael Halliday, though we had and have attempted to use its general semiotic aspects rather than its speciﬁc linguistically focused features as the grounding for our grammar. As Ferdinand de Saussure had done at the beginning of the last century, we see linguistics as a part of semiotics; but we do not see linguistics as the

· viii Preface to the second edition
discipline that can furnish a ready-made model for the description of semiotic modes other than language. Then we had thought, in our ﬁrst attempt, that to show how visual communication works in comparison to language might be helpful in understanding either and both – but that, too, was misunderstood maybe as an attempt to impose linguistic categories on the visual. We have therefore tried to reﬁne and clarify those sections of the book that deal with the relation between language and visual communication, and to delete or reformulate material which we think might have given rise to these misunderstandings, hopefully with no loss of clarity. A careful reading of this second edition of our book will show, we trust, that we are as concerned to bring out the differences between language and visual communication as we are the connections, the broader semiotic principles that connect, not just language and image, but all the multiple modes in multimodal communication.
In our growing understanding of this domain, reﬂected in the reworking of this book, we owe a debt of gratitude for support, comment and critique to many more people than we can mention or even than we actually know. But the names of some friends, colleagues, students, fellow researchers and critics who were not already acknowledged in our preface to the ﬁrst edition have to be mentioned. Among these are Carey Jewitt, Jim Gee, Ron Scollon, Paul Mercer, Brian Street, Radan Martinec, Adam Jaworski, David Machin, Klas Prytz, Teal Triggs, Andrew Burn, Bob Ferguson, Pippa Stein, Denise Newﬁeld, Len Unsworth, Lesley Lancaster and the many researchers whose work has both given us conﬁdence and new ideas, and extended our understanding of this ﬁeld – and of course, and crucially, we acknowledge the support from our publishers and editors at Routledge, Louisa Semlyen and Christabel Kirkpatrick.

Preface to the first edition
This book grew out of discussions about visual communication which spanned a period of seven years. Both of us had worked on the analysis of verbal texts, and increasingly felt the need of a better understanding of all the things that go with the verbal: facial expressions, gestures, images, music, and so on. This was not only because we wanted to analyse the whole of the texts in which these semiotic modes play a vital role rather than just the verbal part, but also to understand language better. Just as a knowledge of other languages can open new perspectives on one’s own language, so a knowledge of other semiotic modes can open new perspectives on language.
In 1990 we published a ﬁrst version of our ideas on visual communication, Reading Images, with Deakin University Press. It was written for teachers, and we concentrated on children’s drawings and school textbook illustrations, although we also included examples from the mass media, such as advertisements and magazine layout. Since then we have expanded our research to other ﬁelds of visual communication: a much wider range of mass media materials; scientiﬁc (and other) diagrams, maps and charts; and the visual arts. We have also made a beginning with the study of three-dimensional communication: sculpture, children’s toys, architecture and everyday designed objects. The present book therefore offers a much more comprehensive theory of visual communication than the earlier book.
In Australia, and increasingly elsewhere, our work has been used in courses on communication and media studies, and as a methodology for research in areas such as media representation, ﬁlm studies, children’s literature and the use of illustrations and layout in school textbooks. The present book has beneﬁted greatly from the suggestions and comments of those who have used our work in these ways, and of our own undergraduate and postgraduate students, initially at the University of Technology and Macquarie University in Sydney, later at the Institute of Education and the London College of Printing in London, and also at the Temasek Polytechnic in Singapore.
We began our work on visual communication in the supportive and stimulating environment of the Newtown Semiotics Circle in Sydney; discussions with our friends, the members of this Circle, helped shape our ideas in more ways than we can acknowledge. If any two people from that ﬁrst period were to be singled out, it would be Jim Martin, who gave us meticulous, detailed, extensive and challenging comments on several of the chapters of the earlier book, and Fran Christie, who had urged us to write it. But here we would also like to make a special mention of Bob Hodge, whose ideas appear in this book in many ways, even if not always obviously so.
Of those who used our book in teaching and research, and whose comments on the earlier book have helped us rethink and reﬁne our ideas, we would like to mention the research team of the Disadvantaged Schools Programme in Sydney, in particular Rick Iedema, Susan Feez, Peter White, Robert Veel and Sally Humphrey; Staffan Selander,

·x Preface to the ﬁrst edition
through whose Centre for Textbook Research in Härnösand our work came to be taken up by researchers in the ﬁeld of textbook research in Sweden and several other European countries; the members of the ‘Language and Science’ research team at the Institute of Education, Isabel Martins, Jon Ogborn and Kieran McGillicuddy; Philip Bell; Basil Bernstein; Paul Gillen and Teun van Dijk.
Three writers inﬂuenced our ideas in different and fundamental ways. One is Roland Barthes. Although we see our work as going beyond his seminal writing on visual semiotics in several ways, he remains a strong inspiration. There is not a subject in semiotics on which Barthes has not written originally and inspiringly. He has provided for us a model of what semiotics can be, in the range of his interests, in the depth of his work, and in his engagement with the social and cultural world. Equally signiﬁcant for us is Michael Halliday. His view of language as a social semiotic, and the wider implications of his theories, gave us the means to go beyond the structuralist approach of 1960s Paris School semiotics, and our work is everywhere inﬂuenced by his ideas. Then there is Rudolf Arnheim. The more we read his work, the more we realize that most of what we have to say has already been said by him, often better than we have done it, albeit it usually in commentaries on individual works of art rather than in the form of a more general theory. He is commonly associated with Gestalt psychology: we would like to claim him as a great social semiotician.
We would like to than our editor, Julia Hall, for her encouragement and invaluable help in producing this book. Jill Brewster and Laura Lopez-Bonilla were involved in various stages of the book; their encouragement and help made the work possible and enjoyable.

Introduction: the grammar of visual design
The subtitle of this book is ‘the grammar of visual design’. We hesitated over this title. Extensions of the term ‘grammar’ often suggest ‘rules’. In books with titles like The Grammar of Television Production one learns, for instance, about the rules of continuity; knowing these rules is then what sets the ‘professional’ apart from the ‘amateur’. What we wish to express is a little different. In our view, most accounts of visual semiotics have concentrated on what might be regarded as the equivalent of ‘words’ – what linguists call ‘lexis’ – rather than ‘grammar’, and then on the ‘denotative’ and ‘connotative’, the ‘iconographical’ and ‘iconological’ signiﬁcance of the elements in images, the individual people, places and things (including abstract ‘things’) depicted there. In this book, by contrast, we will concentrate on ‘grammar’ and on syntax, on the way in which these elements are combined into meaningful wholes. Just as grammars of language describe how words combine in clauses, sentences and texts, so our visual ‘grammar’ will describe the way in which depicted elements – people, places and things – combine in visual ‘statements’ of greater or lesser complexity and extension.
We are by no means the ﬁrst to deal with this subject. Nevertheless, by comparison to the study of visual ‘lexis’, the study of visual ‘grammar’ has been relatively neglected, or dealt with from a different perspective, from the point of view of art history, or of the formal, aesthetic description of composition, or the psychology of perception, or with a focus on more pragmatic matters, for instance the way composition can be used to attract the viewer’s attention to one thing rather than another, e.g. in such applied environments as advertising or packaging. All these are valid approaches, and in many places and many ways we have made use of the insights of people writing from these different perspectives. Yet the result has been that, despite the very large amount of work done on images, not much attention has been paid to the meanings of regularities in the way image elements are used – in short, to their grammar – at least not in explicit or systematic ways. It is this focus on meaning that we seek, above all, to describe and capture in our book. We intend to provide usable descriptions of major compositional structures which have become established as conventions in the course of the history of Western visual semiotics, and to analyse how they are used to produce meaning by contemporary image-makers.
What we have said about visual ‘grammar’ is true also of the mainstream of linguistic grammar: grammar has been, and remains, ‘formal’. It has generally been studied in isolation from meaning. However, the linguists and the school of linguistic thought from which we draw part of our inspiration – linguists following the work of Michael Halliday – have taken issue with this view, and see grammatical forms as resources for encoding interpretations of experience and forms of social (inter)action. Benjamin Lee Whorf argued the point in relation to languages from different cultures. In what he called ‘Standard Average European’ languages, terms like ‘summer’, ‘winter’, ‘September’, ‘morning’, ‘noon’, ‘sunset’ are coded as nouns, as though they were things. Hence these languages

·2 Introduction
make it possible to interpret time as something you can count, use, save, etc. In Hopi, a North American Indian language, this is not possible. Time can only be expressed as ‘subjective duration-feeling’. You cannot say ‘at noon’, or ‘three summers’. You have to say something like ‘while the summer phase is occurring’ (Whorf, 1956).
The critical linguists of the East Anglia School, with whom one of us was connected, have shown that such different interpretations of experience can also be encoded using the resources of the same language, on the basis of different ideological positions. Tony Trew (1979: 106–7) has described how, when the Harare police – in what was in 1975 still Rhodesia – ﬁred into a crowd of unarmed people and shot thirteen of them, the Rhodesia Herald wrote, ‘A political clash has led to death and injury’, while the Tanzanian Daily News wrote, ‘Rhodesia’s white suprematist police . . . opened ﬁre and killed thirteen unarmed Africans.’ In other words, the political views of newspapers are not only encoded through different vocabularies (of the well-known ‘terrorist’ vs ‘freedom ﬁghter’ type), but also through different grammatical structures; that is, through the choice between coding an event as a noun (‘death’, ‘injury’) or a verb (‘kill’), which for its grammatical completion requires an active subject (‘police’) and an object (‘unarmed Africans’).
Grammar goes beyond formal rules of correctness. It is a means of representing patterns of experience. . . . It enables human beings to build a mental picture of reality, to make sense of their experience of what goes on around them and inside them.
(Halliday, 1985: 101)
The same is true for the ‘grammar of visual design’. Like linguistic structures, visual structures point to particular interpretations of experience and forms of social interaction. To some degree these can also be expressed linguistically. Meanings belong to culture, rather than to speciﬁc semiotic modes. And the way meanings are mapped across different semiotic modes, the way some things can, for instance, be ‘said’ either visually or verbally, others only visually, again others only verbally, is also culturally and historically speciﬁc. In the course of this book we will constantly elaborate and exemplify this point. But even when we can express what seem to be the same meanings in either image-form or writing or speech, they will be realized differently. For instance, what is expressed in language through the choice between different word classes and clause structures, may, in visual communication, be expressed through the choice between different uses of colour or different compositional structures. And this will affect meaning. Expressing something verbally or visually makes a difference.
As for other resonances of the term ‘grammar’ (‘grammar’ as a set of rules one has to obey if one is to speak or write in ‘correct’, socially acceptable ways), linguists often protest that they are merely describing what people do, and that others insist on turning descriptions into rules. But of course to describe is to be involved in producing knowledge which others will transform from the descriptive into the normative, for instance in education. When a semiotic mode plays a dominant role in public communication, its use will inevitably be constrained by rules, rules enforced through education, for instance, and

· Introduction 3
through all kinds of written and unwritten social sanctions. Only a small elite of experimenters is allowed to break the rules – after all, breaking rules remains necessary to keep open the possibility of change. We believe that visual communication is coming to be less and less the domain of specialists, and more and more crucial in the domains of public communication. Inevitably this will lead to new, and more rules, and to more formal, normative teaching. Not being ‘visually literate’ will begin to attract social sanctions. ‘Visual literacy’ will begin to be a matter of survival, especially in the workplace.
We are well aware that work such as ours can or will help pave the way for developments of this kind. This can be seen negatively, as constraining the relative freedom which visual communication has so far enjoyed, albeit at the expense of a certain marginalization by comparison to writing; or positively, as allowing more people greater access to a wider range of visual skills. Nor does it have to stand in the way of creativity. Teaching the rules of writing has not meant the end of creative uses of language in literature and elsewhere, and teaching visual skills will not spell the end of the arts. Yet, just as the grammar creatively employed by poets and novelists is, in the end, the same grammar we use when writing letters, memos and reports, so the ‘grammar of visual design’ creatively employed by artists is, in the end, the same grammar we need when producing attractive layouts, images and diagrams for our course handouts, reports, brochures, communiqués, and so on.
It is worth asking here what a linguistic grammar is a grammar of. The conventional answer is to say that it is a grammar of ‘English’ or ‘Dutch’ or ‘French’ – the rules that deﬁne English as ‘English’, Dutch as ‘Dutch’, and so on. A slightly less conventional answer would be to say that a grammar is an inventory of elements and rules underlying culturespeciﬁc forms of verbal communication. ‘Underlying’ here is a shorthand term for something more diffuse and complex, more like ‘knowledge shared more or less by members of a group, explicitly and implicitly’. This brings in subtle matters of what knowledge is and how it is held and expressed, and above all the social question of what a ‘group’ is. That makes deﬁnitions of grammar very much a social question, one of the knowledges and practices shared by groups of people.
We might now ask, ‘What is our “visual grammar” a grammar of ?’ First of all we would say that it describes a social resource of a particular group, its explicit and implicit knowledge about this resource, and its uses in the practices of that group. Then, second, we would say that it is a quite general grammar, because we need a term that can encompass oil painting as well as magazine layout, the comic strip as well as the scientiﬁc diagram. Drawing these two points together, and bearing in mind our social deﬁnition of grammar, we would say that ‘our’ grammar is a quite general grammar of contemporary visual design in ‘Western’ cultures, an account of the explicit and implicit knowledge and practices around a resource, consisting of the elements and rules underlying a culture-speciﬁc form of visual communication. We have quite deliberately made our deﬁnition a social one, beginning with the question ‘What is the group? What are its practices?’ and from there attempting to describe the grammar at issue, rather than adopting an approach which says, ‘Here is our grammar; do the practices and knowledges of this group conform to it or not?’
In the book we have, by and large, conﬁned our examples to visual text-objects from ‘Western’ cultures and assumed that this generalization has some validity as it points to a

·4 Introduction
communicational situation with a long history that has evolved over the past ﬁve centuries or so, alongside writing (quite despite the differences between European languages), as a ‘language of visual design’. Its boundaries are not those of nation-states, although there are, and very much so, cultural/regional variations. Rather, this visual resource has spread, always interacting with the speciﬁcities of locality, wherever global Western culture is the dominant culture.
This means, ﬁrst of all, that it is not a ‘universal’ grammar. Visual language is not – despite assumptions to the contrary – transparent and universally understood; it is culturally speciﬁc. We hope our work will continue to provide some ideas and concepts for the study of visual communication in non-Western forms of visual communication. To give the most obvious example, Western visual communication is deeply affected by our convention of writing from left to right (in chapter 6 we will discuss this more fully). The writing directions of cultures vary: from right to left or from left to right, from top to bottom or in circular fashion from the centre to the outside. Consequently different values and meanings are attached to such key dimensions of visual space. These valuations and meanings exert their inﬂuence beyond writing, and inform the meanings accorded to different compositional patterns, the amount of use made of them, and so on. In other words, we assume that the elements, such as ‘centre’ or ‘margin’, ‘top’ or ‘bottom’, will play a role in the visual semiotics of any culture, but with meanings and values that are likely to differ depending on that culture’s histories of use of visual space, writing included. The ‘universal’ aspect of meaning lies in semiotic principles and processes, the culture-speciﬁc aspect lies in their application over history, and in speciﬁc instances of use. Here we merely want to signal that our investigations have been restricted, by and large, to Western visual communication. Even though others have begun to extend the applications of the principles of this grammar, we make no speciﬁc claims for the application of our ideas to other cultures. Within Western visual design, however, we believe that our theory applies to all forms of visual communication. We hope that the wide range of examples we use in the book will convince readers of this proposition.
Our stress on the unity of Western visual communication does not exclude the possibility of regional and social variation. The unity of Western design is not some intrinsic feature of visuality, but derives from a long history of cultural connection and interchange, as well as now from the global power of the Western mass media and culture industries and their technologies. In many parts of the world, Western visual communication exists side by side with local forms. Western forms might be used, for instance, in certain domains of public communication, such as public notices, sites of public transport, the press, advertising, and the visual arts, as well as in somewhat more ‘private’ domains, in the home, and in markets and shops, for instance. Often the relation is hierarchical, with one form overlaid on another (see Scollon and Scollon, 2003; Kress, 2003), and often – as in advertising, for instance – the two are mutually transformed and fused. Where Western visual communication begins to exert pressure on local forms, there are transitional stages in which the forms of the two cultures mix in particular ways. In looking at advertisements in English-language magazines from the Philippines, for instance, we were struck by the way in which entirely conventional Western iconographical elements were integrated into designs following the

· Introduction 5
rules of a local visual semiotic. In advertisements on the MTR in Hong Kong, some advertisements conform to the ‘Eastern’ directionality, others to the Western, yet others mix the two. As with the Filipino advertisements, discourses and iconography can be ‘Western’, mixed in various ways with those of the ‘East’, while colour schemes can, at the same time, be distinctly non-Western. The situation there is in any case complicated (as it is, differently, in Japan) by the fact that directionality in the writing system has become complicated in several ways: by the adoption, in certain contexts, of ‘Western’ directionality and the Roman alphabet alongside the continued use of the more traditional directionalities and forms of writing. And as economic (and now often cultural) power is re-weighted, the trend can go in both or more directions: the inﬂuence of Asian forms of visual design is becoming more and more present in the ‘West’. Superimposed on all this are the increasingly prominent diasporic communities – of Greeks, Lebanese, Turks, of many groups of the Indian subcontinent, of new and older Chinese communities (for instance, Hong Kong Chinese around the Paciﬁc Rim) – which seemingly affect only the members of this diaspora, and yet in reality are having deep inﬂuences well beyond them.
Within Europe, increasing regionality counterbalances increasing globalization. So long as the European nations and regions still retain different ways of life and a different ethos, they will use the ‘grammar of visual design’ distinctly. It is easy, for example, to ﬁnd examples of the contrasting use of the left and right in the composition of pages and images in the British media. It is harder to ﬁnd such examples in, for instance, the Greek or the Spanish or the Italian media, as students from these countries have assured us and demonstrated in their work – after trying to do the assignments we had set them at home during their holidays. In the course of our book we will give some examples of this, for instance in connection with newspaper layout in different European countries. However, we are not able to do more than touch on the subject; and the issue of different ‘dialects’ and ‘inﬂections’ needs to be explored more fully in the future.
In any case, the unity of languages is a social construct, a product of theory and of social and cultural histories. When the borders of (a) language are not policed by academies, and when languages are not homogenized by education systems and mass media, people quite freely combine elements from the languages they know to make themselves understood. Mixed languages (‘pidgins’) develop in this way, and in time can become the language of new generations (‘creoles’). Visual communication, not subject to such policing, has developed more freely than language, but there has nevertheless been a dominant language, ‘spoken’ and developed in centres of high culture, alongside less highly valued regional and social variants (e.g. ‘folk art’). The dominant visual language is now controlled by the global cultural/technological empires of the mass media, which disseminate the examples set by exemplary designers and, through the spread of image banks and computer-imaging technology, exert a ‘normalizing’ rather than explicitly ‘normative’ inﬂuence on visual communication across the world. Much as it is the primary aim of this book to describe the current state of the ‘grammar of visual design’, we will also discuss the broad historical, social and cultural conditions that make and remake the visual ‘language’.

·6 Introduction
A SOCIAL SEMIOTIC THEORY OF REPRESENTATION
Our work on visual representation is set within the theoretical framework of ‘social semiotics’. It is important therefore to place it in the context of the way ‘semiotics’ has developed during, roughly, the past 75 years. In Europe, three schools of semiotics applied ideas from the domain of linguistics to non-linguistic modes of communication. The ﬁrst was the Prague School of the 1930s and early 1940s. It developed the work of Russian Formalists by providing it with a linguistic basis. Notions such as ‘foregrounding’ were applied to language (e.g. the ‘foregrounding’, for artistic purposes, of phonological or syntactic forms through ‘deviation’ from standard forms, for artistic purposes) as well as to the study of art (Mukarovsky), theatre (Honzl), cinema (Jakobson) and costume (Bogatyrev). Each of these semiotic systems could fulﬁl the same communicative functions (the ‘referential’ and the ‘poetic’ functions). The second was the Paris School of the 1960s and 1970s, which applied ideas from de Saussure and other linguists to painting (Schefer), photography (Barthes, Lindekens), fashion (Barthes), cinema (Metz), music (Nattiez), comic strips (Fresnault-Deruelle), etc. The ideas developed by this School are still taught in countless courses of media studies, art and design, etc., often under the heading ‘semiology’, despite the fact that they are at the same time regarded as having been overtaken by poststructuralism. Everywhere students are learning about ‘langue’ and ‘parole’; the ‘signiﬁer’ and the ‘signiﬁed’; ‘arbitrary’ and ‘motivated’ signs; ‘icons’, ‘indexes’ and ‘symbols’ (these terms come from the work of the American philosopher and semiotician Charles Sanders Peirce, but are often incorporated in the framework of ‘semiology’), and so on. Generally this happens without students being given a sense of, or access to, alternative theories of semiotics (or of linguistics). We will compare and contrast this kind of semiotics with our own approach, in this introduction as well as elsewhere in the book. This third, still ﬂedgling, movement in which insights from linguistics have been applied to other modes of representation has two sources, both drawing on the ideas of Michael Halliday, one growing out of the ‘Critical Linguistics’ of a group of people working in the 1970s at the University of East Anglia, leading to the outline of a theory that might encompass other semiotic modes (Hodge and Kress), the other, in the later 1980s, as a development of Hallidayan systemic-functional linguistics by a number of scholars in Australia, in semiotically oriented studies of literature (Threadgold, Thibault), visual semiotics (O’Toole, ourselves) and music (van Leeuwen).
The key notion in any semiotics is the ‘sign’. Our book is about signs – or, as we would rather put it, about sign-making. We will be discussing forms (‘signiﬁers’) such as colour, perspective and line, as well as the way in which these forms are used to realize meanings (‘signiﬁeds’) in the making of signs. But our conception of the sign differs somewhat from that of ‘semiology’, and we wish therefore to compare the two views explicitly. In doing so we use the term ‘semiology’ to refer to the way in which the Paris School semiotics is generally taught in the Anglo-Saxon world, through the mediation of inﬂuential textbooks such as the series of media studies textbooks edited by John Fiske (Fiske and Hartley, 1979; Dyer, 1982; Fiske, 1982; Hartley, 1982; O’Sullivan et al., 1983). In doing this we do not seek to repudiate those who went before us. We see a continuity between their work

· Introduction 7
and ours, as should be clear from our main title, Reading Images, which echoes that of the ﬁrst volume in Fiske’s series, Reading Television (Fiske and Hartley, 1979).
We would like to begin with an example of what we understand by ‘sign-making’. The drawing in ﬁgure 0.1 was made by a three-year-old boy. Sitting on his father’s lap, he talked about the drawing as he was doing it: ‘Do you want to watch me? I’ll make a car . . . got two wheels . . . and two wheels at the back . . . and two wheels here . . . that’s a funny wheel. . . .’ When he had ﬁnished, he said, ‘This is a car.’ This was the ﬁrst time he had named a drawing, and at ﬁrst the name was puzzling. How was this a car? Of course he had provided the key himself: ‘Here’s a wheel.’ A car, for him, was deﬁned by the criterial characteristic of ‘having wheels’, and his representation focused on this aspect. What he represented was, in fact, ‘wheelness’. Wheels are a plausible criterion to choose for threeyear-olds, and the wheel’s action, on toy cars as on real cars, is a readily noticed and describable feature. In other words, this three-year-old’s interest in cars was, for him, most plausibly condensed into and expressed as an interest in wheels. Wheels, in turn, are most plausibly represented by circles, both because of their visual appearance and because of the circular motion of the hand in drawing/representing the wheel’s action of ‘going round and round’.
To gather this up for a moment, we see representation as a process in which the makers of signs, whether child or adult, seek to make a representation of some object or entity, whether physical or semiotic, and in which their interest in the object, at the point of making the representation, is a complex one, arising out of the cultural, social and psychological history of the sign-maker, and focused by the speciﬁc context in which the signmaker produces the sign. That ‘interest’ is the source of the selection of what is seen as the criterial aspect of the object, and this criterial aspect is then regarded as adequately representative of the object in a given context. In other words, it is never the ‘whole object’ but only ever its criterial aspects which are represented.
These criterial aspects are represented in what seems to the sign-maker, at the moment of sign-making, the most apt and plausible fashion, and the most apt and plausible representational mode (e.g. drawing, Lego blocks, painting, speech). Sign-makers thus ‘have’ a

·8 Introduction
meaning, the signiﬁed, which they wish to express, and then express it through the semiotic mode(s) that make(s) available the subjectively felt, most plausible, most apt form, as the signiﬁer. This means that in social semiotics the sign is not the pre-existing conjunction of a signiﬁer and a signiﬁed, a ready-made sign to be recognized, chosen and used as it is, in the way that signs are usually thought to be ‘available for use’ in ‘semiology’. Rather we focus on the process of sign-making, in which the signiﬁer (the form) and the signiﬁed (the meaning) are relatively independent of each other until they are brought together by the sign-maker in a newly made sign. To put it in a different way, using the example just above, the process of sign-making is the process of the constitution of a sign/metaphor in two steps: ‘a car is (most like) wheels’ and ‘wheels are (most like) circles’.
Putting it in our terms: the sign-maker’s interest at this moment of sign-making has settled on ‘wheelness’ as the criterial feature of ‘car’. He constructs, by a process of analogy, two metaphors/signs: ﬁrst, the signiﬁed ‘wheel’ is aptly represented by the signiﬁer ‘circle’ to make the motivated sign ‘wheel’; second, the signiﬁed ‘car’ is aptly represented by the signiﬁer ‘many wheels’ to make the motivated sign ‘car’. The resulting sign, the drawing glossed ‘this is a car’, is thus a motivated sign in that each conjunction of signiﬁer and signiﬁed is an apt, motivated conjunction of the form which best represents that which is to be meant. This sign is thus the result of a double metaphoric process in which analogy is the constitutive principle. Analogy, in turn, is a process of classiﬁcation: x is like y (in criterial ways). Which metaphors (and, ‘behind’ the metaphors, which classiﬁcations) carry the day and pass into the semiotic system as conventional, and then as naturalized, and then as ‘natural’, neutral classiﬁcations, is governed by social relations of power. Like adults, children are engaged in the construction of metaphors. Unlike adults, they are, on the one hand, less constricted by culture and its already-existing and usually invisible metaphors, but, on the other hand, usually in a position of less power, so that their metaphors are less likely to carry the day.
It follows that we see signs as motivated – not as arbitrary – conjunctions of signiﬁers (forms) and signiﬁeds (meanings). In ‘semiology’ motivation is usually not related to the act of sign-making as it is in our approach, but deﬁned in terms of an intrinsic relation between the signiﬁer and the signiﬁed. It is here that Peirce’s ‘icon’, ‘index’ and ‘symbol’ make their appearance, incorporated into ‘semiology’ in a way which in fact contradicts some of the key ideas in Peirce’s semiotics. The ‘icon’ is the sign in which ‘the signiﬁer– signiﬁed relationship is one of resemblance, likeness’ (Dyer, 1982: 124) – i.e. objective likeness, rather than analogy motivated by ‘interest’, establishes the relation. The ‘index’ is the sign in which ‘there is a sequential or causal relation between signiﬁer and signiﬁed’ (Dyer, 1982: 125); that is, a logic of inference, rather than analogy motivated by ‘interest’. The third term in the triad, ‘symbol’, by contrast, is related to sign production, as it ‘rests on convention, or “contract” ’ (Dyer, 1982: 125), but this very fact makes it ‘arbitrary’, ‘unmotivated’, a case of meaning by decree rather than of active sign-making.
In our view signs are never arbitrary, and ‘motivation’ should be formulated in relation to the sign-maker and the context in which the sign is produced, and not in isolation from the act of producing analogies and classiﬁcations. Sign-makers use the forms they consider apt for the expression of their meaning, in any medium in which they can make signs. When

· Introduction 9
children treat a cardboard box as a pirate ship, they do so because they consider the material form (box) an apt medium for the expression of the meaning they have in mind (pirate ship), and because of their conception of the criterial aspects of pirate ships (containment, mobility, etc.). Language is no exception to this process of sign-making. All linguistic form is used in a mediated, non-arbitrary manner in the expression of meaning. For children in their early, pre-school years there is both more and less freedom of expression: more, because they have not yet learned to conﬁne the making of signs to the culturally and socially facilitated media, and because they are unaware of established conventions and relatively unconstrained in the making of signs; less, because they do not have such rich cultural semiotic resources available as do adults. So when a three-year-old boy, labouring to climb a steep hill, says, ‘This is a heavy hill’, he is constrained by not having the word ‘steep’ as an available semiotic resource. The same is the case with the resources of syntactic and textual forms.
‘Heavy’, in ‘heavy hill’, is, however, a motivated sign: the child has focused on particular aspects of climbing a hill (it takes a lot of energy; it is exhausting) and uses an available form which he sees as apt for the expression of these meanings. The adult who corrects by offering ‘steep’ (‘Yes, it’s a very steep hill’) is, from the child’s point of view, not so much offering an alternative as a synonym for the precise meaning which he had given to ‘heavy’ in that context. Both the child and the parent make use of ‘what is available’; it happens that different things are available to each. But to concentrate on this is to miss the central aspect of sign-making, especially that of children. ‘Availability’ is not the issue. Children, like adults, make their own resources of representation. They are not ‘acquired’, but made by the individual sign-maker.
In ‘semiology’, countless students across the world are introduced to the terms ‘langue’ and ‘parole’, with ‘langue’ explained, for instance, as ‘the abstract potential of a language system . . . the shared language system out of which we make our particular, possibly unique, statements’ (O’Sullivan et al., 1983: 127) or, in our terms, as a system of available forms already coupled to available meanings, and with ‘parole’ deﬁned as:
an individual utterance that is a particular realization of the potential of langue. . . . By extension we can argue that the total system of television and ﬁlm conventions and practices constitutes a langue, and the way they are realized in each programme or ﬁlm a parole.
(O’Sullivan et al., 1983: 127)
We clearly work with similar notions, with ‘available forms’ and ‘available classiﬁcations’ (‘langue’) and individual acts of sign-making (‘parole’), and we agree that such notions can usefully be extended to semiotic modes other than language. But for us the idea of ‘potential’ (what you can mean and how you can ‘say’ it, in whatever medium) is not limited by a system of ‘available meanings’ coupled with ‘available forms’, and we would like to use a slightly less abstract formulation: a semiotic ‘potential’ is deﬁned by the semiotic resources available to a speciﬁc individual in a speciﬁc social context. Of course, a description of semiotic potential can amalgamate the resources of many speakers and many contexts.

· 10 Introduction
But the resulting ‘langue’ (the langue of ‘English’ or of ‘Western visual design’) is in the end an artefact of analysis. What exists, and is therefore more crucial for understanding representation and communication, are the resources available to real people in real social contexts. And if we construct a ‘langue’, a meaning potential for ‘Western visual design’, then it is no more and no less than a tool which can serve to describe a variety of signmaking practices, within boundaries drawn by the analyst. It follows that we would not draw the line between ‘langue’ and ‘parole’ as sharply as it is usually done. Describing a ‘langue’ is describing a speciﬁc set of semiotic resources available for communicative action to a speciﬁc social group.
Here are some antecedents of the car drawing. Figure 0.2 is a drawing made by the same child, some ten months earlier. Its circular motion is expressive of the child’s exuberant, enthusiastic and energetic actions in making the drawing. In ﬁgure 0.3, made about three months later, the circular motion has become more regular. The exuberance and energy are still there, but the drawing has acquired more regularity, more interest in shape: ‘circular motion’ is beginning to turn into ‘circle’. In other words, the meanings of ﬁgure

· Introduction 11
᭡ Fig 0.3 Drawing by a two-year-old child
0.2 persist in ﬁgure 0.3, transformed, yet with signiﬁcant continuity: ﬁgure 0.3 gathers up, so to speak, the meanings of ﬁgure 0.2, and then transforms and extends them.
Figure 0.4, ﬁnally, shows a series of circles, each drawn on a separate sheet, one circle to each sheet. The movement from ﬁgure 0.2 to ﬁgure 0.4 is clear enough, as is the conceptual and transformative work done by the child over a period of fourteen months (ﬁgure 0.4 dates from the same period as ﬁgure 0.1). Together the drawings show how the child developed the representational resources available to him, and why circles seemed such an apt choice to him: the expressive, energetic physicality of the motion of ﬁgure 0.2 persisted as the child developed this representational resource, so that the circular motion remained part of the meaning of circle/wheel. But something was added as well: the transformation of representational resources was also a transformation of the child’s subjectivity, from the emotional, physical and expressive disposition expressed in the act of representing ‘circular motion’ to the more conceptual and cognitive disposition expressed in the act of representing a ‘car’.
Children, like all sign-makers, make their ‘own’ representational resources, and do so as

· 12 Introduction
᭡ Fig 0.4 Drawing by a three-year-old child
part of a constant production of signs, in which previously produced signs become the signiﬁer-material to be transformed into new signs. This process rests on the interest of sign-makers. This transformative, productive stance towards sign-making is at the same time a transformation of the sign-makers’ subjectivity – a notion for which there was little place in a ‘semiology’ which described the relation between signiﬁers and signiﬁeds as resting on inference or objective resemblance, or on the decrees of the social ‘contract’.
We have used children’s drawings as our example because we believe that the production of signs by children provides the best model for thinking about sign-making. It applies also to fully socialized and acculturated humans, with the exception of the effects of ‘convention’. As mature members of a culture we have available the culturally produced semiotic resources of our societies, and are aware of the conventions and constraints which are socially imposed on our making of signs. However, as we have suggested, in our approach adult sign-makers, too, are guided by interest, by that complex condensation of cultural and social histories and of awareness of present contingencies. ‘Mature’ signmakers produce signs out of that interest, always as transformations of existing semiotic materials, therefore always in some way newly made, and always as motivated conjunctions of meaning and form. The effect of convention is to place the pressure of constant limitations of conformity on sign-making; that is, the way signiﬁers have been combined with signiﬁeds in the history of the culture, acts as a constantly present constraint on how far one might move in combining signiﬁers with signiﬁeds. Convention does not negate new making; it attempts to limit and constrain the semiotic scope of the combinations.
This, then, is our position vis-à-vis ‘European’ semiology: where de Saussure had (been assumed to have) said that the relation of signiﬁer and signiﬁed in the sign is arbitrary and conventional, we would say that the relation is always motivated and conventional. Where he had seemingly placed semiotic weight and power with the social, we wish to assert the effects of the transformative role of individual agents, yet also the constant presence of the social: in the historical shaping of the resources, in the individual agent’s social history, in

· Introduction 13
the recognition of present conventions, in the effect of the environment in which representation and communication happen. Yet it is the transformative action of individuals, along the contours of social givens, which constantly reshapes the resources, and makes possible the self-making of social subjects.
One of the now taken-for-granted insights of socially oriented theories of language is the variation of language with the variation of social context. The accounts of this variation differ, ranging from correlation (‘language form x relates to social context y’) to determination (‘language form x is produced by social actors y or in social context y’). A social semiotic approach takes the latter view, along the following lines.
(1) Communication requires that participants make their messages maximally understandable in a particular context. They therefore choose forms of expression which they believe to be maximally transparent to other participants. On the other hand, communication takes place in social structures which are inevitably marked by power differences, and this affects how each participant understands the notion of ‘maximal understanding’. Participants in positions of power can force other participants into greater efforts of interpretation, and their notion of ‘maximal understanding’ is therefore different from that of participants who do their best to produce messages that will require a minimal effort of interpretation, or from that of participants who, through lack of command of the representational system, produce messages that are harder to interpret (e.g. children, learners of a foreign language). The other participants may then either make the effort required to interpret these messages or refuse to do so, whether in a school or in a railway station in a foreign country.
(2) Representation requires that sign-makers choose forms for the expression of what they have in mind, forms which they see as most apt and plausible in the given context. The examples above instantiate this: circles to stand for wheels, and wheels to stand for cars; heavy to stand for signiﬁcant effort, and signiﬁcant effort to stand for climbing a steep slope. Speakers of a foreign language use exactly the same strategy. They choose the nearest, most plausible form they know for the expression of what they have in mind. The requirements of communication are no different in more usual circumstances, they are simply less apparent. The interest of sign-makers, at the moment of making the sign, leads them to choose an aspect or bundle of aspects of the object to be represented as being criterial, at that moment, for representing what they want to represent, and then choose the most plausible, the most apt form for its representation. This applies also to the interest of the social institutions within which messages are produced, and there it takes the form of the (histories of) conventions and constraints.
APPLICATIONS
In the previous section we have focused on the theoretical background of our work, but our aims are not just theoretical. They are also descriptive and practical. We seek to develop a

· 14 Introduction
descriptive framework that can be used as a tool for visual analysis. Such a tool will have its use for practical as well as analytical and critical purposes. To give some examples of the former, educationalists everywhere have become aware of the increasing role of visual communication in learning materials of various kinds, and they are asking themselves what kind of maps, charts, diagrams, pictures and forms of layout will be most effective for learning. To answer this question they need a language for speaking about the forms and meanings of these visual learning materials. Within the media, visual design is less and less the province of specialists who had generally seen little need for methodical and analytically explicit approaches, and had relied instead on creative sensibilities honed through experience. But where media forms are relatively recently introduced – as is the case, for example, with advertising in Eastern Europe and parts of Asia – there is no such resistance to combining systematic analysis and practice. And with the advance of easy to use software for desktop publishing, the production of diagrams and charts, image manipulation, etc., visual design becomes less of a specialist activity, something many people will do alongside other activities. This has already led to rapid growth in the number of courses in this area – and designing such courses requires more of an analytical grasp of principles than learning on the job by example and osmosis. Last, and maybe at bottom at the root of much of this change, is ‘globalization’, which – maybe nearly paradoxically – demands that the cultural speciﬁcities of semiotic, social, epistemological and rhetorical effects of visual communication must be understood everywhere, since semiotic entities from anywhere now appear and are ‘consumed’ everywhere.
Analysing visual communication is, or should be, an important part of the ‘critical’ disciplines. Although in this book we focus on displaying the regularities of visual communication, rather than its (‘interested’, i.e. political/ideological) uses, we see images of whatever kind as entirely within the realm of the realizations and instantiations of ideology, as means – always – for the articulation of ideological positions. The plain fact of the matter is that neither power nor its use has disappeared. It has only become more difﬁcult to locate and to trace. In that context there is an absolute need in democratic terms for making available the means of understanding the articulations of power anywhere, in any form. The still growing enterprise of ‘critical discourse analysis’ seeks to show how language is used to convey power and status in contemporary social interaction, and how the apparently neutral, purely informative (linguistic) texts which emerge in newspaper reporting, government publications, social science reports, and so on, realize, articulate and disseminate ‘discourses’ as ideological positions just as much as do texts which more explicitly editorialize or propagandize. To do so we need to be able to ‘read between the lines’, in order to get a sense of what discursive/ideological position, what ‘interest’, may have given rise to a particular text, and maybe to glimpse at least the possibility of an alternative view. It is this kind of reading for which critical discourse analysis seeks to provide the ways and means. So far, however, critical discourse analysis has mostly been conﬁned to language, realized as verbal texts, or to verbal parts of texts which also use other semiotic modes to realize meaning. We see our book as a contribution to a broadened critical discourse analysis, and we hope that our examples will demonstrate its potential for this kind of work.

· Introduction 15
Our examples include ‘text-objects’ of many kinds, from works of art to entirely ordinary, banal artefacts such as maps, charts, pages of different kinds, including those of websites, etc. We have included works of art not just because of their key role in the history of conventions and constraints, hence in the formation of the ‘grammar of visual design’, but also because they, too, articulate ideological positions of complex and potent kinds, and they, too, should be approached from the point of view of social critique.
As is perhaps already obvious from what we have said so far, we believe that visual design, like all semiotic modes, fulﬁls three major functions. To use Halliday’s terms, every semiotic fulﬁls both an ‘ideational’ function, a function of representing ‘the world around and inside us’ and an ‘interpersonal’ function, a function of enacting social interactions as social relations. All message entities – texts – also attempt to present a coherent ‘world of the text’, what Halliday calls the ‘textual’ function – a world in which all the elements of the text cohere internally, and which itself coheres with its relevant environment. Whether we engage in conversation, produce an advertisement or play a piece of music, we are simultaneously communicating, doing something to, or for, or with, others in the here and now of a social context (swapping news with a friend; persuading the reader of a magazine to buy something; entertaining an audience) and representing some aspect of the world ‘out there’, be it in concrete or abstract terms (the content of a ﬁlm we have seen; the qualities of the advertised product; a mood or melancholy sentiment or exuberant energy conveyed musically), and we bind these activities together in a coherent text or communicative event. The structure of our book reﬂects this. Chapters 2 and 3 deal with the patterns of representation which the ‘grammar of visual design’ makes available, and hence with the ways we can encode experience visually. Chapters 4 and 5 deal with the patterns of interaction which the ‘grammar of visual design’ makes available, and hence with the things we can do to, or for, each other with visual communication, and with the relations between the makers and viewers of visual ‘texts’ which this entails. Chapter 6 deals with the ‘textual’ function, with the way in which representations and communicative acts cohere into meaningful wholes. Chapter 7 deals with the materiality of visual signs – the tools we make them with (ink, paint, brushstrokes, etc.) and the materials we make them on (paper, canvas, computer screens, etc.); these, too, contribute to the meaning of visual texts. Chapter 8 extends the previous chapters into the domain of three-dimensional visuals and moving images. Again we assume that there is something like a Western ‘grammar of three-dimensional visual design’, a set of available forms and meanings used in sculpture as well as, for instance, in three-dimensional scientiﬁc models, or in children’s toys – and a Western ‘grammar of the moving image’.
We will begin, however, by discussing some of the broader themes we have touched on in this introduction.

1 The semiotic landscape: language and visual communication
In the early years of schooling, children are constantly encouraged to produce images, and to illustrate their written work. Teachers comment on these illustrations as much as they do on the written part of the text, though perhaps not quite in the same vein: unlike writing, illustrations are not ‘corrected’ nor subjected to detailed criticism (‘this needs more work’, ‘not clear’, ‘spelling!’, ‘poor expression’, and so on). They are seen as self-expression, rather than as communication – as something which the children can do already, spontaneously, rather than as something they have to be taught.
By the time children are beyond their ﬁrst two years of secondary schooling, illustrations have largely disappeared from their own work. From here on, in a somewhat contradictory development, writing increases in importance and frequency and images become specialized. This is made more problematic by the facts of the present period, in which writing and image are in an increasingly unstable relation. We might characterize the situation of say twenty or thirty years ago in this way: texts produced for the early years of schooling were richly illustrated, but towards the later years of primary school images began to give way to a greater and greater proportion of written text. In as much as images continued, they had become representations with a technical function, maps, diagrams or photographs illustrating a particular landform or estuary or settlement type in a geography textbook, for instance. Thus children’s own production of images was channelled in the direction of specialization – away from ‘expression’ and towards technicality. In other words, images did not disappear, but they became specialized in their function.
In many ways the situation in school remains much the same, with two profoundly important provisos. On the one hand all school subjects now make much more use of images, particularly so in the years of secondary schooling. In many of these subjects, certainly in the more technical/scientiﬁc subjects such as (in England) Science, Information Technology or Geography, images have become the major means of representing curricular content. In the more humanistic subjects – for example, History, English and Religious Studies – images vary in their function between illustration, decoration and information. This trend continues, and it is the case for worksheets, in textbooks and in CDROMs. On the other hand, there is no teaching or ‘instruction’ in the (new) role of images (though in England, in the school subject Information Technology, there is teaching in desktop publishing). Most importantly, assessment continues to be based on writing as the major mode. Students are called upon to make drawings in Science, Geography and History; but, as before, these drawings tend not to be the subject of the teacher’s attention, judging by their (written) comments on the children’s work. In other words, materials provided for children make intense representational use of images; in materials demanded from children – in various forms of assessment particularly – writing remains the expected and dominant mode.
Outside school, however, images play an ever-increasing role, and not just in texts for

· The semiotic landscape 17
children. Whether in the print or electronic media, whether in newspapers, magazines, CDROMs or websites, whether as public relations materials, advertisements or as informational materials of all kinds, most texts now involve a complex interplay of written text, images and other graphic or sound elements, designed as coherent (often at the ﬁrst level visual rather than verbal) entities by means of layout. But the skill of producing multimodal texts of this kind, however central its role in contemporary society, is not taught in schools. To put this point harshly, in terms of this essential new communication ability, this new ‘visual literacy’, institutional education, under the pressure of often reactionary political demands, produces illiterates.
Of course, writing is itself a form of visual communication. Indeed, and paradoxically, the sign of the fully literate social person is the ability to treat writing completely as a visual medium – for instance by not moving one’s lips and not vocalizing when one is reading, not even ‘subvocalizing’ (a silent ‘speaking aloud in the head’, to bring out the full paradox of this activity). Readers who move their lips when reading, who subvocalize, are regarded as culturally and intellectually tainted by having to take recourse to the culturally less valued mode of spoken language when reading visual script. This ‘old’ visual literacy, writing, has for centuries now been one of the most essential achievements and values of Western culture, and one of the most essential goals of education, so much so that one major and heavily value-laden distinction made by Western cultures has been that between literate (advanced) and non-literate (oral and primitive) cultures. No wonder that the move towards a new literacy, based on images and visual design, can come to be seen as a threat, a sign of the decline of culture, and hence a particularly potent symbol and rallying point for conservative and even reactionary social groupings.
The fading out of certain kinds of texts by and for children, then, is not a straightforward disvaluation of visual communication, but a valuation which gives particular prominence to one kind of visual communication, writing, and to one kind of visual literacy, the ‘old’ visual literacy. Other visual communication is either treated as the domain of a very small elite of specialists, or disvalued as a possible form of expression for articulate, reasoned communication, seen as a ‘childish’ stage one grows out of. This is not a valuation of language as such over visual communication, because even now the structures, meanings and varieties of spoken language are largely misunderstood, and certainly not highly valued in their variety in the education system (with some exceptions, such as in formal ‘debating’) or in public forums of power.
To sum up: the opposition to the emergence of the visual as a full means of representation is not based on an opposition to the visual as such, but on an opposition in situations where it forms an alternative to writing and can therefore be seen as a potential threat to the present dominance of verbal literacy among elite groups.
In this book we take a fresh look at the question of the visual. We want to treat forms of communication employing images as seriously as linguistic forms have been. We have come to this position because of the now overwhelming evidence of the importance of visual communication, and the now problematic absence of the means for talking and thinking about what is actually communicated by images and by visual design. In doing so, we have to move away from the position which Roland Barthes took in his 1964 essay ‘Rhetoric of

· 18 The semiotic landscape
the image’ (1977: 32–51). In this essay (and elsewhere, as in the introduction to Elements of Semiology; Barthes, 1967a), he argued that the meaning of images (and of other semiotic codes, like dress, food, etc.) is always related to and, in a sense, dependent on, verbal text. By themselves, images are, he thought, too ‘polysemous’, too open to a variety of possible meanings. To arrive at a deﬁnite meaning, language must come to the rescue. Visual meaning is too indeﬁnite; it is a ‘ﬂoating chain of signiﬁeds’. Hence, Barthes said, ‘in every society various techniques are developed intended to ﬁx the ﬂoating chain of signiﬁeds in such a way as to counter the terror of uncertain signs; the linguistic message is one of these techniques’ (1977: 39). He distinguished between an image–text relation in which the verbal text extends the meaning of the image, or vice versa, as is the case, for example, with the speech balloons in comic strips, and an image–text relation in which the verbal text elaborates the image, or vice versa. In the former case, which he called relay, new and different meanings are added to complete the message. In the latter case, the same meanings are restated in a different (e.g. more deﬁnite and precise) way, as is the case, for example, when a caption identiﬁes and/or interprets what is shown in a photograph. Of the two, elaboration is dominant. Relay, said Barthes, is ‘more rare’. He distinguished two types of elaboration, one in which the verbal text comes ﬁrst, so that the image forms an illustration of it, and one in which the image comes ﬁrst, so that the text forms a more deﬁnite and precise restatement or ‘ﬁxing’ of it (a relation he calls anchorage).
Before approximately 1600 (the transition is, of course, very gradual), Barthes argued, ‘illustration’ was dominant. Images elaborated texts, more speciﬁcally the founding texts of the culture – mythology, the Bible, the ‘holy writ’ of the culture – texts, therefore, with which viewers could be assumed to be familiar. This relation, in which verbal texts formed a source of authority in society, and in which images disseminated the dominant texts in a particular mode to particular groups within society, gradually changed to one in which nature, rather than discourse, became the source of authority. In the era of science, images, ever more naturalistic, began to function as ‘the book of nature’, as ‘windows on the world’, as ‘observation’, and verbal text served to identify and interpret, to ‘load the image, burdening it with a culture, a moral, an imagination’.
This position does explain elements of communication. Any one of the image–text relations Barthes describes may at times be dominant, although we feel that today there is a move away from ‘anchorage’. Compare, for example, the ‘classic’ documentary ﬁlm in which the viewer is ﬁrst confronted with ‘images of nature’, then with the authoritative voice of a narrator who identiﬁes and interprets the images, with the modern ‘current affairs’ item, in which the viewer is ﬁrst confronted with the anchorperson’s verbal discourse and, either simultaneously or following on from the verbal introduction, with the ‘images of nature’ that illustrate, exemplify and authenticate the discourse. But Barthes’ account misses an important point: the visual component of a text is an independently organized and structured message, connected with the verbal text, but in no way dependent on it – and similarly the other way around.
One important difference between the account we develop in this book and that of earlier semioticians is our use of work in linguistic theories and descriptions. This is a difﬁcult argument to make, but worth making clearly. We think that this book would not

· The semiotic landscape 19
have been possible without the achievements of linguistics, yet we do not, in the way some critics of our approach have suggested, see our approach as a linguistic one. So what have we used from linguistics, and how have we used it? And, equally, what have we not used from linguistics? To start with the latter question, we have not imported the theories and methodologies of linguistics directly into the domain of the visual, as has been done by others working in this ﬁeld. For instance, we do not make a separation of syntax, semantics and pragmatics in the domain of the visual; we do not look for (the analogues of) sentences, clauses, nouns, verbs, and so on, in images. We take the view that language and visual communication can both be used to realize the ‘same’ fundamental systems of meaning that constitute our cultures, but that each does so by means of its own speciﬁc forms, does so differently, and independently.
To give an example, the distinction between ‘subjective’ and ‘objective’ meanings has played an important role in Western culture ever since the physical sciences began to develop in the sixteenth century. This distinction can be realized (that is, given concrete, material expression, hence made perceivable and communicable) with linguistic as well as visual means. The terms ‘subjective’ and ‘objective’ can therefore be applied to both: they belong to the meaning potential of a culture and its society. But the way the distinction is realized in language is quite different from the way it is realized in images. For example, in language an idea can be realized subjectively by using a ‘mental process verb’ like believe in the ﬁrst person (e.g. We believe that there is a grammar of images); or objectively through the absence of such a form (e.g. There is a grammar of images). Visual representation, too, can realize both subjectivity, through the presence of a perspectival angle, and objectivity, through its absence, a point which will be discussed more fully in chapter 4. Mental process clauses and nominalization are unique to language. Perspective is unique to images. But the kinds of meaning expressed are from the same broad domain in each case; and the forms, different as they are, were developed in the same period, in response to the same cultural changes. Both language and visual communication express meanings belonging to and structured by cultures in the one society; the semiotic processes, though not the semiotic means, are broadly similar; and this results in a considerable degree of congruence between the two.
At the same time, however, each medium has its own possibilities and limitations of meaning. Not everything that can be realized in language can also be realized by means of images, or vice versa. As well as a broad cultural congruence, there is signiﬁcant difference between the two (and other semiotic modes, of course). In a language such as English one needs to use a verb in order to make a full utterance (believe, is); and language has to use names to refer to whatever is to be represented (a grammar of images, believe, we). But language does not have or need angles of vision to achieve perspective, nor does it have or need spatial dispositions of elements to achieve the meanings of syntactic relations: images have and need both. The meaning potentials of the two modes are neither fully conﬂated nor entirely opposed. We differ from those who see the meaning of language as inherent in the forms and the meaning of images as derived from the context, or the meanings of language as ‘conscious’ and the meanings of images as ‘unconscious’.
To return to the ﬁrst of our two questions – What have we used from linguistics, and

· 20 The semiotic landscape
how have we used it? – perhaps the most signiﬁcant borrowing is our overall approach, an ‘attitude’ which assumes that, as a resource for representation, images, like language, will display regularities, which can be made the subject of relatively formal description. We call this a ‘grammar’ to draw attention to culturally produced regularity. More speciﬁcally, we have borrowed ‘semiotic orientations’, features which we taken to be general to all human meaning-making, irrespective of mode. For instance, we think that the distinction between ‘objectivity’ and ‘subjectivity’ is a general cultural/semiotic issue which can be realized linguistically as well as visually, though differently so, as we have said. Or, as another instance, we have taken Michael Halliday’s social semiotic approach to language as a model, as a source for thinking about general social and semiotic processes, rather than as a mine for categories to apply in the description of images. His model with its three functions is a starting point for our account of images, not because the model works well for language (which it does, to an extent), but because it works well as a source for thinking about all modes of representation.
Maybe most to the point is this: our approach to communication starts from a social base. In our view the meanings expressed by speakers, writers, printmakers, photographers, designers, painters and sculptors are ﬁrst and foremost social meanings, even though we acknowledge the effect and importance of individual differences. Given that societies are not homogeneous, but composed of groups with varying, and often contradictory, interests, the messages produced by individuals will reﬂect the differences, incongruities and clashes which characterize social life. It is likely, and in our experience often the case, that the different modes through which texts are constructed show these social differences, so that in a multimodal text using images and writing the writing may carry one set of meanings and the images carry another. In an advertisement, for instance, it may be that the verbal text is studiously ‘non-sexist’, while the visual text encodes overtly sexist stereotypes. Given the still prevalent sense about the meaning of images, it is possible to pretend that the meaning carried in the image is there only ‘in the eye of the beholder’, something that it would not be possible to assert about verbally realized meanings.
Our examples in this book are quite deliberately drawn from very many domains, and from different historical periods. We hope that our ideas will help anyone interested in communication to see in images not only the aesthetic and expressive, but also the structured social, political and communicative dimensions. We will draw examples from the kinds of texts which are already fully based on the new visual literacy and play a dominant role in any public sphere, magazine articles, advertisements, textbooks, websites and so on. This is not because we want to promote these texts as a kind of model which should replace other kinds of texts, but because their role in the lives of children and adults is so important that we simply cannot afford to leave the ability to think and talk about them (and, indeed, to produce them) to a handful of specialists. We have a particular interest in the place of the visual in the lives of children, and we hope to show that children very early on, and with very little help (despite all the encouragement), develop a surprising ability to use elements of the visual ‘grammar’ – an ability which, we feel, should be understood better and developed further, rather than being cut off prematurely as is, too often, the case at present; and an ability that should also be available to adults.

AN UNCONVENTIONAL HISTORY OF WRITING
The dominance of the verbal, written medium over other visual media is ﬁrmly coded and buttressed in conventional histories of writing. These go something like this. Language in its spoken form is a natural phenomenon, common to all human groups. Writing, however, is the achievement of only some (historically, by far the minority of) cultures. At a particular stage in the history of certain cultures, there developed the need to make records of transactions of various kinds, associated usually with trade, religion or (governing) power. These records were initially highly iconic; that is, the relation between the object to be recorded and the forms and means of recording was close and transparent. For instance, the number of notches in a stick would represent the number of objects stored or traded or owed. The representation of the object would usually also be transparent: a wavy line eventually became the Chinese ideogram for ‘water’; the hieroglyphic image of the ox’s head which initially ‘stood for’ ‘ox’ eventually became the letter aleph (ℵ),alpha (α),a.This example illustrates what in these histories is regarded as the rarest of all achievements, the invention of alphabetic writing.
Alphabetic writing developed, it seems clear, out of iconic, image-based scripts. In these original script forms, an object was initially represented by an image of that object. Over time, in the use of the script by different groups, speaking different languages, the image of the object came to stand for the name of the object and then for its initial letter. Aleph, ‘ox’ in Egyptian hieroglyphics, after centuries of travel and constant transformation through the cultures and languages of the eastern Mediterranean, became the letter alpha, and eventually the letter a in the Roman alphabet. Clearly this was a process where each step involved considerable abstraction, so much so that, seemingly, alphabetic writing has been invented only once in the history of human cultures. All present alphabetic scripts, from India to the Middle East to Europe, are developments of that initial step from Egyptian (or possibly Sumerian) iconic hieroglyphic representation to the Phoenician alphabet, and from there westward to the Greek-speaking world, and eastward to the Indian subcontinent, or, in the region of its origin, developing into the Arabic version of the alphabet.
This is indeed an impressive cultural history, impressive enough to have stood as the accepted historical account of the achievement of (alphabetic) writing, unquestioned for centuries. Within this account, all cultures with forms of visual representation that are not directly connected to language are treated as cultures without writing. However, it is worth investigating this history, and in particular the crucial step from visual representation to the link with language, a little more closely. Prior to this step (in reality a development spanning millennia) there were two separate and independent modes of representation. One was language-as-speech; the other, the visual image, or visual marks. Each served a particular set of purposes such as the construction of histories and myths, the recording of genealogies and transactions, and the recording and measurement of objects. In the case of some cultures, however, the one form of representation ‘took over’ the other, as a means of recording; that is, visual representation became specialized – one could say, reduced – to function as a means of the visual representation of speech, perhaps in highly organized and

· 22 The semiotic landscape
bureaucratized societies. At this point the visual was subsumed, taken over, by the verbal as its means of recording. Consequently its former public uses, possibilities and potentials for independent representation disappeared, declined and withered away.
In the case of other cultures, however, this development did not occur. Here the visual continued, along with the verbal means of representation. Instances of this abound: from the one extreme of the Inca quipu strings (sensorily the tactile mode of representation) to Australian Aboriginal drawings, sand-paintings and carvings. These encode, in a manner not at all directly dependent on, or a ‘translation’ of, verbal language, meanings of the culture which are deemed to be best represented in visual form. They are connected with language, or language with them, so that wall-paintings or sand-paintings, for instance, are accompanied by verbal recounts of geographical features, journeys, ancestor myths, and so on. However, in these cases there is no question of the priority of the one over the other mode, and the visual has certainly not become subsumed to the verbal as its form of representation.
In this connection it is interesting to consider the history of two words which in a sense are synonymous with Western notions of literacy, the words grammar and syntax. Grammar derives from the Greek grammatike (‘the art of reading and writing’, ‘grammar’, ‘alphabet’); related words were gramma (‘sign’, ‘letter’, ‘alphabet’), grammatikos (‘literate’, ‘(primary) teacher’, ‘grammarian’). This etymology records the state of things in the Hellenistic period (from approximately 300bc); in earlier times the meaning ‘sign’, as in ‘painted or drawn [etc.] mark’ was the primary meaning. In Homer, for example, the verb graphein still means ‘scratch’, ‘scratch in’, as in engraving, and from there it comes to mean both ‘writing’ and ‘drawing’, ‘painting’. Syntaxis, in pre-Hellenistic times, meant ‘contract’, ‘wage’, ‘organization’, ‘system’, ‘battle formation’, with syntagma, for instance, ‘contingent of troops’, ‘constitution (of a state)’, ‘book or treatise’. Only in the Hellenistic period does syntaxis come to mean (among its other meanings) ‘grammatical construction’. The verb syntasso, again, means both ‘arrange battle formations’ and ‘concentrate (one’s thoughts)’, ‘organize’, ‘write’, ‘compose’.
While we do not wish to place too much emphasis on etymology, nevertheless the history of these two words which are so crucial to our notions of literacy points to forms of social organization and order, on the one hand, and to visual ‘markings’ on the other. Together they indicate the initially quite independent organization of the mode of images and the mode of verbal language. At the same time, the subsequent history of the word grammar brings out clearly the subordination of the visual medium to the medium of verbal language. Cultures which still retain the full use of both media of representation are, from the point of view of ‘literate cultures’, regarded as illiterate, impoverished, underdeveloped, when in fact they have a richer array of means of representation than that overtly and consciously available to literate cultures. Nevertheless, as we pointed out earlier, literate cultures do make use of means of visual communication other than writing, be it that they are seen as uncoded replicas of reality or as a means of individual expression by children or artists. In other words, they are not treated as either the expressions of, or accessible to means of reading based on, articulated, rational and social meanings.
Our unconventional history of writing is one that treats the coming together of visual

· The semiotic landscape 23
and verbal representation as only one possibility, and one, furthermore, that brings with it not just those beneﬁts of writing which are well enough understood, but also the negative aspects incurred in the loss of an independent form of representation, the diminution of modes of expression and representation. From that point of view cultures such as Australian Aboriginal cultures are seen as having both modes of representation: the visual (or perhaps a whole set of visual forms of representation) and the verbal. The point of this history is not only the political one of undermining the notion of ‘illiterate culture’ (or ‘merely oral culture’), but also the attempt to see to what extent the conventional history blinds us to the facts and uses of visual communication in so-called literate cultures.
In this book we develop the hypothesis that in a literate culture the visual means of communication are rational expressions of cultural meanings, amenable to rational accounts and analysis. The problem which we face is that literate cultures have systematically suppressed means of analysis of the visual forms of representation, so that there is not, at the moment, an established theoretical framework within which visual forms of representation can be discussed.
THE ‘OLD’ AND THE ‘NEW’ VISUAL LITERACY IN BOOKS FOR THE VERY YOUNG
So far we have distinguished two kinds of visual literacy: one in which visual communication has been made subservient to language and in which images have come to be regarded as unstructured replicas of reality (the ‘old visual literacy’, in our terms); and another in which (spoken) language exists side by side with, and independent of, forms of visual representation which are openly structured, rather than viewed as more or less faithful duplicates of reality (the ‘new’, in our terms). We have looked at these as historical and cultural alternatives. But they also exist side by side, at least in contemporary Western culture, and we suggest that we are in the middle of a shift in valuation and uses from the one mode to the other, from the ‘old’ to the ‘new’ visual literacy, in many important social contexts. The examples we will now discuss suggest that the very ﬁrst books children encounter may already introduce them to particular kinds of visual literacy.
Figure 1.1 shows a typical two-page spread from Baby’s First Book, a book which, on its inside cover, declares that ‘the text and illustrations, though oversimple to grown-ups, will satisfy their [i.e. the toddlers’] cravings for the repetition of what they already know, and will help them associate the words with the objects’. When we wrote the ﬁrst version of this chapter, in 1989, it was still widely distributed, and today it is already making a comeback as an object of nostalgia.
Figure 1.2 shows a typical page from Dick Bruna’s On My Walk. This book is one of a set of four, the others being In My Home, In My Toy Cupboard and On the Farm. It consists of eight pages and, with the exception of the front and back covers, the pages contain no words whatsoever.
Compared to the picture of the bird in the tree, the picture of the bath is realistic, detailed and complex. If we were to analyse it into its components, if we were to try

· 24 The semiotic landscape
᭡ Fig 1.1 My bath (from Baby’s First Book, Ladybird)
and identify all the different elements of this picture, we might encounter problems. Are the ripples in the water to be counted as components? Are the shadows, cast by the tub and towel? And if we were to try and identify the relations between these components, what would we have to say, for example, about the relation between the duck and the soap? We ask these questions because they are the kinds of questions with which one might start if one wanted to show that images are structured messages, amenable to constituent analysis. Isn’t the structure here that of the cultural object ‘bathroom’, rather than one imposed by the conventions of a visual code? Isn’t this picture unproblematically, transparently readable (recognizable), provided one knows what bathrooms look like?
This is the line Paris School semioticians such as Roland Barthes and Christian Metz took in the 1960s. Commenting on photography, Barthes said:
In order to move from the reality to its photograph it is in no way necessary to divide up this reality into units and to constitute these units as signs, substantially different from the object they communicate. . . . Certainly, the image is not the reality but at least it is its perfect analogon and it is exactly this analogical perfection which, to commonsense, deﬁnes the photograph. Thus can be seen the special status of the photographic image: it is a message without a code.
(Barthes, 1977: 17)

· The semiotic landscape 25
᭡ Fig 1.2 Bird in tree (Bruna, 1988)
And he extends this argument to other pictorial modes, albeit with a qualiﬁcation: Are there other messages without a code? At ﬁrst sight, yes: precisely the whole range of analogical reproductions of reality – drawings, paintings, cinema, theatre. However, each of those messages develops in an immediate and obvious way a supplementary message . . . which is what is commonly called the style of the reproduction. (Barthes, 1977: 17)
The picture of the bird in the tree, on the other hand, is much less naturalistic, much less detailed and much simpler than the picture of the bathroom. It is stylized and conventional, and quite clearly a ‘coded’ image. No depth, no shadows, no subtle nuances of colour: everything is plain and bold and simple. And the structure of the image, with its one central and four marginal images, does not imitate anything in the real world. It is a conventional visual arrangement, based on a visual code. As a result the components of the whole stand out as separate, distinct units, and the picture would seem quite amenable to constituent analysis. This is not just a matter of style: the structure of this picture could also be realized in more detailed styles. Bruna’s book dates from 1953, well before the era of computer ‘imaging’, but the picture of the bird in the tree could have been composed with a computer, aligning ready-made simple icons in a compositional conﬁguration – it is in fact quite similar to the computer-drawn dinner invitation in ﬁgure 1.3.

· 26 The semiotic landscape
᭡ Fig 1.3 Computer-drawn dinner invitation
Second, the picture of the bathroom is part of a two-page layout, and accompanied by words. Language comes ﬁrst, authoritatively imposing meaning on the image, turning it into a typical instance of a bathroom by means of the generic label ‘Bath’. As a result the picture could be replaced by other images of bathrooms without much loss of meaning (one verbal text, many images, many possible illustrations). Here language is general, bestowing similarity and order on the diverse, heterogeneous world of images. Thus the book presents, on the one hand, an ‘uncoded’, naturalistic representation (‘the world as it is’ – empirical, factual, speciﬁc) and, on the other hand, a speciﬁc, authoritatively prescribed way of reading this ‘uncoded’ naturalistic picture. We will show later that, contrary to what Barthes and others argued in the 1960s, pictures of this kind are also structured, whether they are photographs, drawings, paintings or other kinds of pictures. For the moment, however, the important point is that they are not usually interpreted as such, that awareness of the structuredness of images of this kind is, in our society, suppressed and not part of ‘common sense’.
In Dick Bruna’s On My Walk, by contrast, there are no words to authoritatively impose meaning on the image, and the image is no longer an illustration: the image carries the meaning, the words come second. Parents who read this book with their children could all tell a different story, could even use different languages (one image, many verbal texts).

· The semiotic landscape 27
The world of ‘one image, many different verbal texts’ (‘commentaries’) imposes a new mode of control over meaning, and turns the image, formerly a record of nature or a playground for children and artists, into a more powerful, but also more rigorously controlled and codiﬁed public language, while it gives language, formerly closely policed in many social institutions, a more private and less controlled, but also less powerful, status. The ‘readings’ which parents produce when they read On My Walk with their children may all be different, yet these different readings will necessarily have common elements, deriving from their common basis – the elements included in the image, and the way these elements are compositionally brought together.
Whatever story parents will tell about the page with the bird in the tree, it will necessarily have to be a story that creates a relation between, for instance, birds and aeroplanes (nature and technology) and birds and cats (prey and predator). It will also have to be a story in which the bird, safely in its tree, is the central character, literally and ﬁguratively. In how many ways can cats and birds be related? Not that many, at least not if one assumes that books like On My Walk serve to introduce children to the world around them, rather than to the possible worlds of fantasies and utopias. Cats can ‘hunt’, ‘torture’, ‘kill’ and ‘eat’ birds. Birds can ‘escape’ cats or fail to do so. There are not that many stories to choose from. On the other hand, parents and their children can choose the order in which they want to deal with the various elements: the page is ‘non-linear’. It does not impose a sequential structure. And they can choose whether to tell the story of the bird and the cat as a political story, a story of powerful predators coming from another continent and native birds killed and threatened with extinction (as might be done, for instance, in Australia), or as a story that legitimizes the survival of the ﬁttest. The story of the bird and the aeroplane, similarly, may be told from an environmentalist point of view, or as a story of evolutionary triumphs and human technological progress. Even where such discourses are not explicitly invoked, they will still communicate themselves to children through the parents’ attitudes towards the characters and the actions.
Not only the elements on the individual pages, but also the pages themselves must be brought in relation to each other. The book as a whole must be readable as a coherent sequence. This is prompted by the title (On My Walk) as well as by the picture on the front cover, which shows all the elements together. We have investigated this a little further in connection with another book in the Bruna series, On the Farm. This book contains the following central pictures: house, farmer, cat, dog, apple tree, rooster, lamb, cow. Listing the ways in which these pictures can plausibly be linked to each other, we found that some (e.g. the apple tree and the house) can only be linked in spatial, locative terms (e.g. the apple tree is next to the house). Others (e.g. the animals and the house) can be related by verbs of ‘dwelling’ (e.g. the cow lies under the apple tree) or by the verbs of ‘motion’ (e.g. the cat climbs up the apple tree). Two of the animals (the cat and the dog) can relate to the other animals and to each other by means of antagonistic or co-operative actions (e.g. the dog barks at the cow; the dog leads the sheep). Only the farmer can relate to all the other elements in an agentive way. He can buy them, own them, build them, grow them, keep them, raise them, harvest them, shear them, slaughter them, and so on. In other words, whatever way the parents read these pictures, they will, in the end, have to deal with the

· 28 The semiotic landscape
theme of spatial order, the theme of social interaction (projected on to animals) and the theme of human mastery over nature (as well as, via the marginal pictures, with the theme of procreation), and they will have to do all this in terms of the elements pre-selected by the book. An analysis of the way the elements can be opposed to each other shows that, whatever the classiﬁcations parents may construct, they will not be able to avoid engaging with the Western cultural distinctions between ‘untamed nature’, ‘domesticated/cultivated nature’ and ‘human technology’. And they will also have to recognize the distinction between animate and inanimate, ﬂora and fauna, and between pets, farm animals and wild animals.
It should be noted, however, that every page in the book (and in Bruna’s other books) contains at least one relation that does not easily ﬁt the received classiﬁcations, that forms somewhat of a challenge and a puzzle. What, for example, is the relation between a rabbit and a basket of ﬂowers? A beetle and a fence? Such visual enigmas can challenge parents and children to exercise their imagination, to include in their thinking elements that do not easily ﬁt in with the traditional order of things, to tolerate some ambiguity, to allow the inclusion of the ‘other’ in their construction of the world.
The two books, then, are very different in their stance towards the image. The Bruna stance presents highly processed, essentialized and idealized representations, and provides parents and, later, children with the opportunity to talk about the images in ways which are or seem appropriate to them, to apply speciﬁc values, speciﬁc discourses to these relatively abstract images. The Ladybird stance presents ostensibly less processed, more naturalistic visual representations and provides parents (and, later on, children) with a speciﬁc verbally realized way of reading the image. The Ladybird book is open and interactive from the perspective of the image, and authoritarian from the perspective of writing; the Bruna book works in the opposite way. The closure in the Bruna book lies in the limits which selection, form and structure of the images impose on the apparently open readings – these enter the discourses which are already ‘in’ the socialized parents, so that the whole, once orally transmitted to the children, will appear spontaneous and ‘natural’ to parents and children alike. Are they not, after all, merely engaged in an innocent reading of ‘what is there’ in the pictures? Thus the two books represent two different forms of social control over meaning. One is openly and explicitly located in the text itself; the other lies, perhaps more covertly and implicitly, in the way the book presents itself less as a text than as an organized resource for making texts, jointly with the parental discourses that will inevitably enter the text as well.
These discourses, however, are not themselves part of Bruna’s books, of the public text meant to transcend their diversity. Instead they are relegated to the realm of the private, of ‘lifestyles’ where they do not threaten the order of the larger social world. There is never just ‘heteroglossia’ (many meanings), nor ever just ‘homoglossia’ (one authoritative meaning). Instead there is a role distribution among the different semiotics, a role distribution in which some semiotics are given a great deal of social power, but at the price of being subjected to greater institutional (and technological) control, while others are allowed relative freedom from control, but pay for this with diminished power. Today, we seem to move towards a decrease of control over language (e.g. the greater variety of accents

· The semiotic landscape 29
allowed on the public media, the increasing problems in enforcing normative spelling), and towards an increase in codiﬁcation and control over the visual (e.g. the use of image banks from which ready-made images can be drawn for the construction of visual texts, and, generally, the effect of computer imaging technology).
The two forms of control over meaning can be found elsewhere also. Compare, for example, the classic documentary ﬁlm – in which an authoritative ‘voice of God’ narrator explains and interprets images of recorded reality – to the more modern ‘direct cinema’ documentary, in which control over meaning lies in the selection of images and in the sometimes hardly noticeable ways in which these images are edited together. Or think of the way in which, in the ﬁeld of ‘cultural studies’, an emphasis on analysing ‘what the text says’ is gradually being replaced by an emphasis on ‘how different audiences read the same text’, an emphasis, in other words, on the apparent freedom of interpretation which, by diverting attention away from the text itself, allows the limitations which the text imposes on this ‘freedom of reading’ to remain invisible, and therefore, perhaps, all the more efﬁcacious and powerful.
In this connection the background of the Bruna book is worth brief mention. It was ﬁrst printed in 1953, in Amsterdam, and reprinted many times in its country of origin. The ﬁrst British printing was in 1978. The time lag is perhaps no accident. Unlike the British, the Dutch had, early in the twentieth century, recognized that their country did not have a ‘common culture’, but was divided into groups characterized by different and often opposing ideologies, zuilen (literally ‘columns’, ‘pillars’), as the Dutch have called them. Dutch broadcasting, for example, had from its inception in the late 1920s a system in which different levensbeschouwelijke groups (i.e. ‘groups orientated towards a particular view of life’) ran broadcasting organizations which were allotted air time according to the size of their membership. Thus the same events would, on radio and later on television, be interpreted from a variety of different discursive ideological positions, while most other European countries had centralized, usually government-run, broadcasting organizations with one authoritative message. For a message to reach, in this context, the whole population, it had to be adaptable to a variety of cultural and ideological constructions and, as we have seen, the Bruna books use the visual medium to achieve exactly that. Perhaps the belated success of the series in countries like Britain and Australia shows that there is now, in these countries too, an increasing awareness that they no longer have a ‘common culture’, and that, instead, they have become complex, diverse and discursively divided, and therefore in need of new forms of communication (although the Dutch zuilen system went in decline from the 1960s onwards).
The changing distributions of meaning between language and image, which we suggest is now in full ﬂow, was foreshadowed by various experiments in the Soviet Union of the early 1920s. While linguists and literary scholars like Voloshinov and Bakhtin wrote of language as socially divided, ‘multi-accentual’ and ‘heteroglossic’, constructivist artists like Malevich, El Lissitzky and Rodchenko, and ﬁlm-makers like Eisenstein, rejected naturalism and began to elaborate a new visual language, capable of communicating new, revolutionary ideas visually. Then, as now, images became more stylized, more abstract and more obviously coded: the new visual language was explicitly compared with language,

· 30 The semiotic landscape
with hieroglyphic writing, with the stylized masks of kabuki theatre. Then, as now, visual communication was also seen as transparent: colours and shapes were thought to have a direct, unmediated, ‘psychological’ impact, a non-semiotic capacity for stirring the emotions of the ‘masses’. Then, as now, visual communication was to be removed from the sphere of art, to become part of the more powerful and more public sphere of industrial production, of typography, design, architecture. This semiotic revolution was allied to the political revolution: constructivist posters and ﬁlms had a propagandistic purpose – they sought to help bring about a cultural revolution, and they had to get their message across to a socially and linguistically heterogeneous population. The visual, thought to be able to produce an emotive immediacy, was to be the medium that could achieve this. In the end, the new semiotic order failed to establish itself permanently. It was crushed by Stalin. Oldfashioned centralist and repressive control over meaning (and with it a return to naturalist, ‘bourgeois’ art) prevailed over control by means of a form of propaganda that could allow pluralism and ideological cohesion to coexist. This time – though with very different political, social, technological and economic conditions – it may not fail.
The semiotic shifts we have exempliﬁed in our discussion of the two children’s books can be observed elsewhere, too. The shift from ‘uncoded’ naturalistic representations to stylized, conceptual images can be seen, for instance, on the covers of news magazines, which used to be dominated by documentary photographs – photographs recording events, or portraying newsworthy people. Occasionally this still happens, as in ﬁgure 1.4, but increasingly the photographs on magazine covers are contrived and posed, using conventional symbols to illustrate the essence of an issue, rather than documenting newsworthy events, as in ﬁgure 1.5, where a padlock and a United States ﬂag, against a neutral background, illustrate the issue of tightened border control. Unlike the picture of the ‘Bird in Tree’ (ﬁgure 1.2), these are still photographic images, but they might as well be drawings.
As an example of the changing relation between language and image, consider an extract from a Science CD-ROM for the lower years of high school (ﬁgure 1.6). Here language has here been displaced by the visual as decisively as in the Bruna book. Instead of the major medium of information, with the visual as ‘illustration’, it has become a medium for comment or labelling, with the visual as the central source of information. Two questions need asking: one is the question of implicit changes in notions and practices of reading, and of reading science in particular; the other is the question of changes in the constitution of what is represented here, science itself. The students/viewers/users of the science CD-ROM are no longer addressed via the hierarchically complex structures of scientiﬁc writing, with its speciﬁc demands for cognitive processing, and its need to ‘translate’ verbal forms to their three-dimensional or visual equivalents (as on the page reproduced in ﬁgure 1.7). They are addressed largely in the visual mode, and either as ‘scientists’ who understand abstraction from the empirically real, or as people focusing on the empirically real with the intention to understand the regularities lying ‘behind’ that reality. In other words, even though the visual mode might seem to provide direct access to the world, it is as amenable to realizing theoretical positions as is the verbal.
More complex is the question whether, in this dramatic shift from the verbal to the visual, the very constitution of the school subject Science is undergoing a transformation.

· The semiotic landscape 31
᭡ Fig 1.4 Magazine cover with naturalistic photograph (Newsweek, 19 April 2004)
Can everything that was communicable in the formation of scientiﬁc writing be said in these visually constructed forms? Conversely, are there possibilities of scientiﬁc communication in the visual which were not available in the mode of writing? And which of these is a more apt medium for scientiﬁc theory? Will scientiﬁc theories change as the form of expression shifts from the written to the visual mode? We cannot take up these questions here, but if we are to make ourselves conscious of the far-reaching implications of these changes in the semiotic landscape, they need at least to be asked.
Implicit in this is a central question, which needs to be put openly, and debated seriously: is the move from the verbal to the visual a loss or a gain? Our answer at this stage in our thinking is multiple. There are losses, and there are gains. Our argument throughout this book is that different semiotic modes – the visual, the verbal, the gestural, etc. – each have their potentialities and their limitations. A move from a central reliance on one mode to a central reliance on another will therefore inevitably have effects in both directions. But that is not the end of the story. We also have to consider what is represented. It may be that visual representation is more apt to the stuff of science than language ever was, or even that a science which is constructed visually will be a different kind of science. The world represented visually on the screens of the ‘new media’ is a differently constructed world to that which had been represented on the densely printed pages of the print media of some

· 32 The semiotic landscape
᭡ Fig 1.5 Magazine cover with conceptual photograph (Newsweek, 12 November 2001)
thirty or forty years ago. The resources it offers for understanding and for meaning-making differ from those of the world represented in language, and so do the citizens it produces.
These are far-reaching questions and they can only be answered by considering the interconnections between the changing political, economic and cultural conditions gathered up under the label of globalization and the new possibilities for representation afforded by the new media of production and dissemination. We have barely hinted at these kinds of questions in our discussion of the Bruna and Ladybird books. Could it be the case that information is now so vast, so complex, that perhaps it has to be handled visually, because the verbal is no longer adequate?
Mere nostalgia, mere social and cultural regrets or pessimism cannot help here. We, all of us, have our particular standpoints and our particular values carried forward from yesterday or from the day before yesterday. The ﬁrst most important challenge is to understand this shift, in all of its detail, and in all of its meaning. From that understanding, we can hope to begin the task of constructing adequate new value systems.
To summarize: (1) Visual communication is always coded. It seems transparent only because we know
the code already, at least implicitly – but without knowing what it is we know, without

᭡ Fig 1.7 Early twentieth-century science textbook (McKenzie, 1938)
having the means for talking about what it is we do when we read an image. A glance at the ‘stylized’ arts of other cultures should teach us that the myth of transparency is indeed a myth. We may experience these arts as ‘decorative’, ‘exotic’, ‘mysterious’ or

· 34 The semiotic landscape
‘beautiful’, but we cannot understand them as communication, as forms of ‘writing’ unless we are, or become, members of these cultures. (2) Societies tend to develop explicit ways for talking only about those semiotic resources which they value most highly, and which play the most important role in controlling the common understandings they need in order to function. Until now, language, especially written language, has been the most highly valued, the most frequently analysed, the most prescriptively taught and the most meticulously policed mode in our society. If, as we have argued, this is now changing in favour of more multiple means of representation, with a strong emphasis on the visual, then educationalists need to rethink what will need to be included in the curricula of ‘literacy’, what should be taught under its heading in schools, and consider the new and still changing place of writing as a mode within these new arrangements.
If schools are to equip students adequately for the new semiotic order, if they are not to produce people unable to use the new resources of representation actively and effectively, then the old boundaries between the mode of writing on the one hand, and the ‘visual arts’ on the other, need to be redrawn. The former had traditionally been that form of literacy without which people could not adequately function as citizens or as workers; the latter had been either a marginal subject for the specially gifted, or a subject with limited and specialized applications, as in ‘technical drawing’. The newly deﬁned area will have to involve the technologies of the ‘new screens’ – the electronic technologies of information and communication, central now to the semiotic landscape. But above all, such a curriculum is crucially dependent on having the means of analysis, the means for talking about the ‘new literacy’, about what it is we do when we produce and read images. As Iedema (1994: 64) notes, in the ‘post-Fordist’ workplace,
Workers must be multi-skilled, articulate and ‘self-steering’. . . . [They] negotiate their jobs as members of ‘quality circles’ and consultative committees. This requires that workers are not merely capable of doing their work, but also that they are capable of talking and thinking about their work and its effectiveness.
Elsewhere (Kress, 2000; Kress and van Leeuwen, 2001) we have talked of the need for the introduction of the concept of design, both as a category with general signiﬁcance in representation and communication, and as a crucial category for developing the curricula of institutionalized education, whether in the traditional school or other formal sites of learning. This is implicit also in the description we have given earlier in this chapter of the new forms of reading. This is not the place to develop that point, though it is essential to draw attention to its unavoidable signiﬁcance as part of the urgent need for developing adequate ways and talking about the visual.

THE SEMIOTIC LANDSCAPE
The place of visual communication in a given society can only be understood in the context of, on the one hand, the range of forms or modes of public communication available in that society and, on the other hand, their uses and valuations. We refer to this as ‘the semiotic landscape’. The metaphor is worth exploring a little, as is its etymology. The features of a landscape (a ﬁeld, a wood, a clump of trees, a house, a group of buildings) only make sense in the context of their whole environment and of the history of its development (‘waste land’ has meaning only in that context, as has ‘ﬁeld’ or ‘track’; ‘village’ has meaning only as a group of buildings that is part of a history of ways of working the land). In the same way, particular features and modes of communication should be seen in the history of their development, and in the environment of all the other modes of communication which surround them. The use of the visual mode is not the same now as it was even ﬁfty years ago in Western societies; it is not the same from one society to another; and it is not the same from one social group or institution to another.
Each feature of a landscape has its history, as does the landscape as a whole, and each is subject to constant remaking. It is here that the etymology of the word landscape is revealing. To the casual beholder a landscape simply is, and may even have a timeless appearance (‘the timeless beauty of the English, or Spanish, countryside’). Yet it is in fact a product of social action and of a social history, of human work on the land, on nature: –scape, with its relation to shape in English and schaffen (both ‘to work’ and ‘to create’) in German, indicates this. And this applies also to the ‘semiotic landscape’. Metaphoric excursions of this kind can be stretched too far; however, we will allow ourselves one other point of comparison. Landscapes are the result, not just of human social work, but also of the characteristics of the land itself. The ﬂat land by the river is most suitable for the grazing of cattle or the growing of wheat; the hillsides for vineyards or forestry. At the same time, the characteristic values of a culture may determine which of the potential uses of the land are realized, whether the hillsides are used for vineyards or forestry, for example. And cultural values may even induce people to go against the grain of the land, to use the steep hillside for growing rice, for example, which opposes the ‘natural potential’ of the land almost to the limit.
Semiotic modes, similarly, are shaped both by the intrinsic characteristics and potentialities of the medium and by the requirements, histories and values of societies and their cultures. The characteristics of the medium of air are not the same as those of the medium of stone, and the potentialities of the speech organs are not the same as those of the human hand. Nevertheless, cultural and social valuations and structures strongly affect the uses of these potentialities. It is not an accident that in Western societies written language has had the place which it has had for the last three or four millennia, and that the visual mode has in effect become subservient to language, as its mode of expression in writing. Western linguistic theories have more or less naturalized the view that the use of air and the vocal organs is the natural, inevitable semiotic means of expression. But even speech is, in the end, cultural. We are not biologically predisposed to use speech as our major mode of communication. The parts of the body that we call the ‘speech organs’ are an adaptation of

· 36 The semiotic landscape
physical organs initially developed to prevent humans from choking while breathing and eating. When the need arises, we can and do use other means of expression, as in the highly articulated development of gesture in sign languages, and also in theatrical mime and certain Eastern forms of ballet. And, while these are at present restricted to relatively marginal domains, who is to say that this will always remain so in the future development of humankind? It is salutary to consider how other cultures ‘rank’ modes of communication, and to bring that knowledge into the mainstream of ‘Western’ thinking (see, for instance, Finnegan, 2002).
The new realities of the semiotic landscape are brought about by social, cultural and economic factors: by the intensiﬁcation of linguistic and cultural diversity within the boundaries of nation states; by the weakening of these boundaries within societies, due to multiculturalism, electronic media of communication, technologies of transport and global economic developments. Global ﬂows of capital and information of all kinds, of commodities, and of people, dissolve not only cultural and political boundaries but also semiotic boundaries. This is already beginning to have the most far-reaching effects on the characteristics of English (and Englishes) globally, and even within national boundaries.
The place, use, function and valuation of language in public communication is changing. It is moving from its former, unchallenged role as the mode of communication, to a role as one mode among others, to the function, for instance, of being a mode for comment, for ratiﬁcation, or for labelling, albeit more so in some domains than in others, and more rapidly in some areas than in others. Although this is a relatively new phenomenon in public communication, children do it quite ‘naturally’ in their text-making.
New ways of thinking are needed in this ﬁeld. Here we use, once more, children’s representation as a metaphor to suggest some directions. The drawings reproduced in ﬁgure 1.8 were made by a ﬁve-year-old boy. On a summer Sunday afternoon, while his parents were entertaining friends, the child took a small, square notepad from near the telephone and drew a picture on each of six pages. His father had not noticed this until he came across him in the hall of their house, where the child was putting the cards ‘in order’, as shown in ﬁgure 1.8. Asked what he was doing, the child’s account was as follows: for pictures 1 and 2 together ‘Me and the dog are in life, so they’re in the correct order’; on pictures 3 and 4 ‘The ﬂying bomb is in the air and the plane is in the air, so they’re in the correct order’; and on 5 and 6 ‘The patterns are in the correct order’.
The whole process, involving sign-making, representation and classiﬁcation, had proceeded through the visual medium. It was only when the parent came along with his question that the child was forced to use words. The metaphoric processes of sign-making, the acts of representation and classiﬁcation, each involving quite complex analogies, took place in the visual mode. Language, as speech, entered when communication with the parent became necessary. Speech was the mode used for ‘ratifying’ and for describing what had taken place without it.
Some two weeks later, at the end of the summer term of his primary school, the child brought home some of his exercise books. Among these was the page shown in ﬁgure 1.9. Clearly, here the task was one of classiﬁcation, and it had been undertaken at school, prior to the making and ordering of the drawings in ﬁgure 1.8, at home. A whole sequence of

· The semiotic landscape 37
᭡ Fig 1.8 Six drawings by a ﬁve-year-old boy
semiotic activities is thus involved, a sequence of production, transformation and development, moving from the initial task of joining images of the same objects – a classiﬁcatory, cognitive, conceptual, semiotic and manual task – to that of producing complex and dissimilar images, and ﬁnding likeness in them (or imposing likeness on them) through an intermediary task of abstraction and generalization. If we think about this period of two weeks, the child’s production of signs involved a series of distinct semiotic modes, and of translations between such modes. First the teacher spoke with the children about the task (mode: language as speech); then she introduced the book and showed them what was at issue (mode: 3D physical object, and visual mode); then the children used their pencils to draw the connecting lines (mode: manual action and visual mode of drawing); then the teacher engaged the children in spoken discussion, and made evaluative comments on their

· 38 The semiotic landscape
᭡ Fig 1.9 School exercise book of a ﬁve-year-old boy
work. This was followed by a long period of ‘silence’, a fortnight or so when nothing was seen or heard, but when, we assume, the series of transformative acts of the child continued ‘internally’, ‘mentally’. Finally the internal activity became visible, literally, through the child’s unprompted production of the drawings, his unprompted classiﬁcatory activity (spatially shown) and his spoken commentary in response to his father’s question.
Of course, while all this took place the child, as do all of us, would no doubt have experienced constantly shifting affective, emotional states. He might have been enthused by the task in the class and praised by the teacher for his success; he might have had a difﬁcult time with his friends in the playground, or at home, and so on, and all of this would have inﬂuenced how he ‘read’ the activity and how it was ‘taken up’ by him. If we see it like this,

· The semiotic landscape 39
it makes it impossible to think of affect and cognition as distinct, as separable. In other words, here – as always – the affective aspects are always one with, and act continuously as a ‘modality’ on, cognitive semiotic processes.
In part in response to the representational, semiotic and cognitive resources made available by the teacher, and her demands made in the class, though afterwards prompted by his own interests, the child used a series of different representational modes (including, of course, ‘internal representations’) in a constantly productive sequence of semiotic activities. Some happened within the same mode (linking the images of the object by a line, for instance), some took place by a shift across modes (the shift from the spatially performed classiﬁcation to the spoken commentary on it). Such processes are constantly transformative (the name we use for such processes within one mode) and transductive (our name for such processes across modes). All these, we assume, have effects on ‘inner resources’, which constantly reshape (transform) the subjectivity of the child.
As we have indicated, the visual, actional and spatial modes, rather than speech, seemed to be the central representational and cognitive resources. Speech was used for communication with adults, as a means for translation, for comment and for ratiﬁcation. It may well be that the complexities realized in the six images and their classiﬁcation were initially beyond the child’s capacity of spoken expression, conception and formulation, but that the visual mode offered him semiotic and cognitive resources which were not available to him in the verbal mode. However, once expressed in the visual mode, once classiﬁed through the visual/spatial mode, the meanings which the child had produced became available as externalized, objective expression; this in turn may have made them differently available for verbal expression, for the verbal ratiﬁcation of semiotic, affective/cognitive processes that had already taken place.
This incessant process of ‘translation’, or ‘transcoding’ – transduction – between a range of semiotic modes represents, we suggest, a better, a more adequate understanding of representation and communication. In the example we have discussed here, language is not at the centre. In many areas of public communication the same is either the case already, or rapidly coming to be the case. And clearly it matters which semiotic modes of representation and communication are dominant, most frequent, most valued in the public domains in which we act.
Figure 1.10 comes from work done by two (13-year-old) students in Science, in the early years of secondary school in England. Two questions can be asked. The ﬁrst is, What is the effect of the mode of representation on the epistemology of science?, and the second: ‘Do different modes of representation facilitate, or rule out, different accounts of natural phenomena?’ To answer both, we need to compare two differing modal representations of ‘the same’ issue.
This time our question is not ‘What is the status of written language in these texts?’ but rather ‘What is the effect of the different modal realizations in terms of epistemology, in terms of the students’ perspective on knowledge?’ If we compare ﬁgure 1.10 with just one example from another exercise for assessment – the task ‘to write a story of the journey of a red blood cell around the body’ – we can see the rudiments of that difference. Here is a brief extract from one such ‘story’, in this case written in the genre of ‘diary’:

· 40 The semiotic landscape
᭡ Fig 1.10 Concept map: ‘blood circulation’
Dear Diary, I have just left the heart. I had to come from the top of the right chamber of the heart (Right atrium) and squeeze my way through to the Right ventricle where the heartbeat got stronger, and I left the heart.
Dear Diary, I am currently in the lungs, it is terribly cramped in here as the capillaries are tiny and there are millions of us. We have just dropped off oxygen and we picked up some carbon dioxide.
Dear Diary, we have entered the liver where we had a thorough wash. Dear Diary, we have just left the kidney where we dropped off some water which will be turned into urine. Dear Diary, I have ﬁnished my journey around the body by stopping off at the heart. In the diary, the fundamental organizational principle, or logic, is that of ‘sequence in time’, and the fundamental representational principle is that of action or event or, less frequently, states of affairs. Objects are related to other objects by actions represented by verbs (‘we have entered the liver’, ‘we have just left the kidney’). The actions and events themselves are arranged in temporal sequence, mirroring that of the imagined events as they happened in the world. In the concept map, on the other hand, the fundamental organizational principle is that of a conceptual order, realized by the spatial arrangements of the

· The semiotic landscape 41
individual concepts. Here objects are related, not by actions, but by hierarchy, by signiﬁcance deriving from relation of ‘priority’ of various kinds.
All these examples reveal what has in fact always been the case: language, whether in speech or writing, has always existed as just one mode in the ensemble of modes involved in the production of texts, spoken or written. A spoken text is never just verbal, but also visual, combining with modes such as facial expression, gesture, posture and other forms of self-presentation. A written text, similarly, involves more than language: it is written on something, on some material (paper, wood, vellum, stone, metal, rock, etc.) and it is written with something (gold, ink, (en)gravings, dots of paint, etc.); with letters formed as types of font, inﬂuenced by aesthetic, psychological, pragmatic and other considerations; and with layout imposed on the material substance, whether on the page, the computer screen or a polished brass plaque. Yet the multimodality of written texts has, by and large, been ignored, whether in educational contexts, in linguistic theorizing or in popular common sense. Today, in the age of ‘multimedia’, it can suddenly be perceived again.
We can summarize this discussion in the form a set of hypotheses: (a) human societies use a variety of modes of representation; (b) each mode has, inherently, different representational potentials, different potentials for meaning-making; (c) each mode has speciﬁc social valuation in particular social contexts; (d) different potentials for meaningmaking may imply different potentials for the formation of subjectivities; (e) individuals use a range of representational modes, and therefore have available a range of means of meaning-making, each affecting the formation of their subjectivity; (f) the different modes of representation are not held discretely, separately, as strongly bounded autonomous domains in the brain, or as autonomous communicational resources in culture, nor are they deployed discretely, either in representation or in communication; (g) affective aspects of human beings and practices are not discrete from other cognitive activity, and therefore never separate or absent from representational and communicative behaviour; (h) each mode of representation has a continuously evolving history, in which its semantic reach can contract or expand or move into different areas of social use as a result of the uses to which it is put.
None of these hypotheses would, we imagine, attract signiﬁcant disagreement, especially when put singly. Jointly they represent a challenge to the existing common sense on the relations between language and thought and in mainstream theories and practices in all areas of public communication. This is a crucial feature of the new semiotic landscape.
A NOTE ON A SOCIAL SEMIOTIC THEORY OF COMMUNICATION
In order to function as a full system of communication, the visual, like all semiotic modes, has to serve several representational and communicational requirements. We have adopted the theoretical notion of ‘metafunction’ from the work of Michael Halliday for this

· 42 The semiotic landscape
purpose. The three metafunctions which he posits are the ideational, the interpersonal and the textual. In the form in which we gloss them here they apply to all semiotic modes, and are not speciﬁc to speech or writing.
The ideational metafunction Any semiotic mode has to be able to represent aspects of the world as it is experienced by humans. In other words, it has to be able to represent objects and their relations in a world outside the representational system. That world may of course be, and most frequently is, already semiotically represented.
In doing so, semiotic modes offer an array of choices, of different ways in which objects, and their relations to other objects and to processes, can be represented. Two objects may be represented as involved in a process of interaction which could be visually realized by vectors:
᭡ Fig 1.11 Vector
But objects can also related in other ways, for instance in terms of a classiﬁcation. They would be connected, not by a vector but, for instance, by a ‘tree’ structure:
᭡ Fig 1.12 Tree structure
In chapters 2 and 3 we will investigate precisely which ideational choices are available for visual sign-making in this way.
The interpersonal metafunction Any semiotic mode has to be able to project the relations between the producer of a (complex) sign, and the receiver/reproducer of that sign. That is, any mode has to be able to represent a particular social relation between the producer, the viewer and the object represented.
As in the case of the ideational metafunction, modes offer an array of choices for representing different ‘interpersonal’ relations, some of which will be favoured in one form of visual representation (say, in the naturalistic image), others in another (say, in the

diagram). A depicted person may be shown as addressing viewers directly, by looking at the camera. This conveys a sense of interaction between the depicted person and the viewer. But a depicted person may also be shown as turned away from the viewer, and this conveys the absence of a sense of interaction. It allows the viewer to scrutinize the represented characters as though they were specimens in a display case.
In chapters 4 and 5 we will discuss these and other interpersonal choices, both in terms of the kinds of interactions that can be represented, and in terms of the visual features that realize these interactions. The textual metafunction Any semiotic mode has to have the capacity to form texts, complexes of signs which cohere both internally with each other and externally with the context in and for which they were produced. Here, too, visual grammar makes a range of resources available: different compositional arrangements to allow the realization of different textual meanings. In ﬁgure 1.1, for example, the text is on the left and the picture on the right. Changing the layout (ﬁgure 1.13) would completely alter the relation between written text and image and the meaning of the whole. The image, rather than the written text, would now serve as point of departure, as ‘anchor’ for the message. In chapter 6 we will discuss such left–right relationships and other compositional resources.
᭡ Fig 1.13 Altered layout of ﬁgure 1.1 (left–right reversal)

· 44 The semiotic landscape
Our focus is on the description of these ideational, interpersonal and textual resources as they are realized in the visual mode. We recognize that in doing this work we are engaged in more than ‘mere description’, and participate ourselves in the reshaping of the semiotic landscape; and we realize also that this is a highly political enterprise.

2 Narrative representations: designing social action
INTRODUCTION The pictures shown in ﬁgure 2.1 are taken from an Australian primary-school social studies textbook (Oakley et al., 1985). One represents the traditional technology of the Australian Aborigines, the other the superior technology of those who invaded their territory (‘The British had a technology that was capable of changing the face of the earth. Their tools were able to work faster than those of the Aborigines and their weapons were much more powerful’). The former has three main elements (an axe, a basket and a wooden sword), the latter four (the ‘British’, as they are called in the caption, their guns, the Aborigines and the landscape). But the two pictures differ not only in what each includes and excludes (the left picture, for instance, excludes the users of the technology, the right picture includes them), they differ also in structure: they relate their elements to each other differently. The elements of the left picture are arranged symmetrically, against a neutral background: axe, basket and wooden sword are represented as equal in size, placed at equal distance from each other and oriented in the same way towards the horizontal and the vertical axes, so that the picture as a whole creates a relation of similarity between the three elements. The picture says, as it were, that this axe, this basket and this wooden

· 46 Narrative representations
sword all belong to the same overarching category (a category, incidentally, which is only implied, and which conﬂates the notion of ‘tools’ and the notion of ‘weapons’).
The right picture represents technology in action. Where the left picture is impersonal, this picture is personal. Where the left picture is static, this picture is dynamic. Where the left picture is dry and conceptual, this picture is dramatic. It relates the British and the Aborigines through a transactional schema in which the British play the role of ‘Actor’, the ones who do the deed, and the Aborigines the role of ‘Goal’, the ones to whom the deed is done – the British stalk the Aborigines, one could say. It also relates the landscape to the British and the Aborigines in a ‘locative’ way (the British and the Aborigines are in the landscape), and the gun to the British in an ‘instrumental’ way (the British stalk the Aborigines with their guns).
These relations can be transformed into linguistic form, as we have just done, but the point is that here they are realized by visual means. The transactional relation between the British and the Aborigines is realized by the vector that links them, namely the oblique lines formed by the glances and outstretched arms of the British and by their guns. The locative relation is realized by overlapping, by the gradients of focus, the degrees of colour saturation and so on, which create the contrast between foreground and background. And the instrumental relation is realized by the gesture of holding, where the object held is a tool.
The important point at this stage is not the detail of the analysis, but the observation that the semiotic modes of writing and visual communication each have their own quite particular means of realizing what may be quite similar semantic relations. What in language is realized by words of the category ‘action verbs’ is visually realized by elements that can be formally deﬁned as vectors. What in language is realized by locative prepositions is visually realized by the formal characteristics that create the contrast between foreground and background. This is not to say that all the relations that can be realized linguistically can also be realized visually – or vice versa, that all the relations that can be realized visually can also be realized linguistically. Rather, a given culture has a range of general, possible relations which is not tied to expression in any particular semiotic mode, although some relations can only be realized visually and others only linguistically, or some more easily visually and others more easily linguistically. This distribution of realization possibilities across the semiotic modes is itself determined historically and socially as well as by the inherent potentialities and limitations of a semiotic mode.
To return to the two pictures in ﬁgure 2.1, they can be said to represent an aspect of the experiential world, technology. But through the different design patterns selected in each, through the manner in which each brings its individual elements together into a coherent and meaningful whole, they represent the technology of Aborigines very differently from the technology of the British. Nothing about Aboriginal technology necessitates it to be represented as a static, conceptual taxonomy, nor is there anything intrinsic about British technology that requires it to be represented in a personalized and dramatized way. British technology is just as capable of being represented by a classiﬁcatory scheme as is Aboriginal technology, and it is just as possible to tell dramatic stories of Aborigines stalking their invaders with spears or wooden swords as it is to tell such stories about the British, even if the former kind of story does not usually form part of mainstream Australian

· Narrative representations 47
history. In other words, the representation is mediated, visually, through two distinct discourses: that of anthropology for Aboriginal people – who ‘know no history’; and that of history for the whites – who are not subjects of anthropology.
Imagine a reversal of those relations. Imagine on the left a catalogue of British tools and weapons, and on the right a picture in which Aborigines point their wooden swords at a small group of British in the background. Suddenly a representation of colonization as the transition from a ﬁxed, stable (‘primitive’) order of things to the dynamic unfolding of history is changed into something like the revenge of the ‘primitive’ on the West’s technological order. This may be suitable for a ﬁction ﬁlm, perhaps, set safely in an apocalyptic future, but not for a primary-school textbook in contemporary Australia.
The two design patterns in ﬁgure 2.1, the classiﬁcatory pattern and the transactional pattern, are only two of several possible patterns. In the course of this chapter we will introduce others, and try to give an overview of the visual structures that can realize ways of representing the world. Our emphasis is not on depiction, nor on the question of recognition, on how we come to see conﬁgurations of pencil marks or brushstrokes or pixels as pictures of trees, or on how pictures of trees may connote or symbolize meanings and values over and above what they literally represent. This aspect of the pictorial has already received a good deal of attention in the writings of philosophers (e.g. Goodman, 1969; Hermeren, 1969), semioticians (e.g. Eco, 1976a; Barthes, 1977), media analysts (Williamson, 1978) and art historians (e.g. Panofsky, 1970). At this stage of our work on visual communication we have little to add to what has been said in these areas.
The question of visual structuring, on the other hand, has, in our opinion, been dealt with less satisfactorily. Visual structuring has either been treated as simply reproducing the structures of reality (e.g. Metz, 1974a, 1974b), rather than as creating meaningful propositions by means of visual syntax, or it has been discussed in formal terms only (e.g. Arnheim, 1974, 1982, who in his actual analyses offers many insights on the semantic dimension of visual structuring). Our example of the representation of Aboriginal and British technology has, we hope, made clear why neither of these approaches satisﬁes us. Visual structures do not simply reproduce the structures of ‘reality’. On the contrary, they produce images of reality which are bound up with the interests of the social institutions within which the images are produced, circulated and read. They are ideological. Visual structures are never merely formal: they have a deeply important semantic dimension.
PARTICIPANTS
In chapter 1 we deﬁned the ideational metafunction as the ability of semiotic systems to represent objects and their relations in a world outside the representational system or in the semiotic systems of a culture. In the introduction to the present chapter we tried to show how two design patterns can produce two different representations of broadly the same aspect of the world. Instead of ‘objects’ or ‘elements’ we will, from now on, use the term ‘participants’ or, more precisely, ‘represented participants’. This has two advantages: it points to the relational characteristic of ‘participant in something’; and it draws

· 48 Narrative representations
attention to the fact that there are two types of participant involved in every semiotic act, interactive participants and represented participants. The former are the participants in the act of communication – the participants who speak and listen or write and read, make images or view them, whereas the latter are the participants who constitute the subject matter of the communication; that is, the people, places and things (including abstract ‘things’) represented in and by the speech or writing or image, the participants about whom or which we are speaking or writing or producing images.
The situation is of course more complex than this, for the real interactive participants, the real image-producers and -viewers, cannot be taken to be identical with the ‘implied’ producer who ‘silently instructs us, through the design of the whole’ (Chatman, 1978: 148) and the ‘implied’ viewer. It may also be that the producers and/or viewers are themselves explicitly represented in the image, causing the two categories to shade into each other, complexities which have been studied extensively in the ﬁeld of literary narratology (e.g. Iser, 1978; Bal, 1985; Rimmon-Kenan, 1983). We will return to these in the next chapter; for the purposes of this chapter the basic distinction will sufﬁce.
In the case of abstract visuals such as diagrams, it does not seem too difﬁcult to determine who or what the represented participants are. Shannon and Weaver’s famous ‘communication model’ (ﬁgure 2.2), for instance, is made up of boxes and arrows (Shannon and Weaver, 1949). The boxes represent participants (people and/or things, the distinction being blurred by objectifying labels like ‘information source’ and ‘destination’); the arrows represent the processes that relate them. If we wanted to translate this into language, we could say that the boxes are like nouns, the arrows like verbs (e.g. ‘send’ or ‘transmit’), and that, together, they form clauses (e.g. ‘an information source sends [information] to transmitter’).
In the case of more detailed naturalistic images, however, it may be difﬁcult, even futile, to try and identify the represented participants. Take ‘The British used guns’, for instance (ﬁgure 2.1). Do we include the hats and kerchiefs worn by the two men? Every single tree, every single one of the rocks strewn about in the foreground? The analogy with language loses its relevance here. In language, words such as man, gun, tree, rocky ground abstract away from details of this kind. In naturalistic images this does not happen. They are ‘worth a thousand words’.
᭡ Fig 2.2 Shannon and Weaver’s communication model

· Narrative representations 49
Yet we think that naturalistic images can be analysed into participants and processes much in the same way as diagrams. There are two different, but in the end compatible, ways of arguing this. The ﬁrst is the way of formal art theory (e.g. Arnheim, 1974, 1982). The language of this kind of theory is, for the most part, formalistic, and grounded in the psychology of perception. Participants are called ‘volumes’ or ‘masses’, each with a distinct ‘weight’ or ‘gravitational pull’. Processes are called ‘vectors’ or ‘tensions’ or ‘dynamic forces’. But, and this is what matters for the purpose of identifying participants, these ‘volumes’ are perceived as distinct entities which are salient (‘heavy’) to different degrees because of their different sizes, shapes, colour, and so on. Thus the two men in ﬁgure 2.1 stand out as a distinct entity because of the tonal contrast between their silhouettes and the light of the ﬁre. And what is more, we recognize their shapes on the basis of visual schemas not unlike those that are realized in diagrams. Artists have long learned their craft by reducing the visible world to simple geometric forms (see Gombrich, 1960). According to Arnheim (1974: ch. 4), children learn to draw in the same way, building up a repertoire of basic forms, and then, gradually, ‘fusing the parts’. If the perception of pictures does indeed operate on the basis of the same principles as the production of pictures, we might grasp the overall structure of a picture like ‘The British used guns’ according to a schema that is not so different from that of Shannon and Weaver’s communication model, as shown in ﬁgure 2.3.
The second way of identifying participants is that of functional semiotic theory (see Halliday, 1978, 1985). The conceptual apparatus of this kind of theory has, so far, been
᭡ Fig 2.3 Schematic reduction of ﬁgure 2.1, showing vector

· 50 Narrative representations
applied only to language, the most frequently and methodically analysed semiotic system. It is oriented towards the semantic functions rather than towards the forms of the participants. It uses terms like ‘Actor’, ‘Goal’ and ‘Recipient’ rather than terms like ‘volume’ and ‘mass’. Yet the two approaches are compatible. The most salient ‘volumes’ in ‘The British used guns’ are not only perceptually most conspicuous, they also play the most crucial roles in the grammatical structure that constitutes the meaning of the picture: the two men (the participant from which the vector emanates) have the role of Actor, and the Aborigines (the participant at which the vector points) have the role of Goal in a structure that represents their relation as a Transaction, as something done by an Actor to a Goal. The same terms (‘Actor’, ‘Goal’, ‘Transaction’) are used in functional linguistics. This is possible because they are semantic-functional, rather than formal, terms. Our use of these terms does not imply that images and diagrams work in the same way as language; only that they can ‘say’ (some of) the same things as language – in very different ways: what in language is realized by means of syntactic conﬁgurations of certain classes of nouns and certain classes of verbs is visually realized, made perceivable and communicable, by the vectorial relations between volumes. In Arnheim’s words, ‘We shall distinguish between volumes and vectors, between being and acting’ (1982: 154).
The transactional structure is not the only kind of structure that can be realized visually. We have already discussed an example of a classiﬁcatory structure (a subject which we will take up in more detail in a later section; see pp. 79–87). In the picture in ﬁgure 2.4, taken from the same social studies textbook as ﬁgure 2.1 (Oakley et al., 1985), the structure is ‘analytical’. Here the participants have the roles not of ‘Actor’ and ‘Goal’ but of ‘Carrier’ and ‘Attribute’. This picture is not about something which participants are doing to other participants, but about the way participants ﬁt together to make up a larger whole. It has the structure of a map. Just as in maps a larger participant, the ‘Carrier’, represents the ‘whole’ (say, Australia), and a number of other participants, the ‘Possessive Attributes’, represent the ‘parts’ (say, the states of Australia), so the Antarctic explorer functions as ‘Carrier’, and the balaclava, the windproof top, the fur mittens, etc. function as ‘Possessive Attributes’, as the parts that make up the whole. The closest linguistic translation here – were we to attempt one – would not be an action clause like ‘The British point their guns at the Aborigines’, but a ‘possessive attributive’ clause like ‘The outﬁt of the Antarctic explorer consists of a balaclava, a windproof top, fur mittens . . . [etc.]’
We can now look at the abundance of detail in naturalistic images in a new way. The naturalistic image, whatever else it may be about, is always also about detail. It contains a multitude of embedded ‘analytical’ processes. It may, at the most salient level, say, ‘The British point their guns at the Aborigines’, but it will also, at less immediately conspicuous levels, say things like ‘The men’s outﬁts consist of hats, kerchiefs . . . [etc.]’ and ‘The trees have clumps of leaves.’ In language, prepositional phrases (two men with hats and kerchiefs) and subordinate clauses (two men, wearing hats and kerchiefs) fulﬁl the same function of adding detail at a ‘secondary’ or even more deeply embedded level.
Embedding can also occur in diagrams. Take the ‘communication model’ in ﬁgure 2.5, a model drawn up, not by two telecommunication engineers, as in the case of Shannon and Weaver (ﬁgure 2.2), but by two sociologists, Riley and Riley (1959). As a whole, the

· Narrative representations 51
᭡ Fig 2.4 Antarctic explorer (Oakley et al., 1985)
᭡ Fig 2.5 Communication model (from Watson and Hill, 1980: 143)
diagram is ‘analytical’; it is a kind of abstract map. It shows that the ‘over-all social system’ consists of ‘larger social structures’ which in turn consist of ‘primary groups’. It also features two individuals, ‘C’ (‘Communicator’) and ‘R’ (‘Recipient’). These are depicted as half in, half out of the ‘larger social structures’, and they are connected to, though not part of, the ‘primary groups’. Embedded within this analytical structure is a

᭡ Fig 2.6 Two communication models (from Watson and Hill, 1980: 147)
transactional structure: the ‘larger social structures’ and the individuals ‘C’ and ‘R’ are represented as involved in an active process of communication, realized by vectors.
When we look at ‘The British used guns’ (in ﬁgure 2.1) as a transactional structure, the two men form one participant: together they have the role of ‘Actor’. When we look at the two men as an ‘analytical’ structure, they form two distinct participants, linked by the lines formed by the hand of the man on the right and the gun of the man on the left. Diagrams allow further possibilities, as can be seen in the two communication models in ﬁgure 2.6, both drawn by Schramm (1954), a social psychologist writing about mass communication. In the ﬁrst model, ‘source’ and ‘encoder’ are separate entities, conjoined by a line, just as are the two men in ‘The British used guns’. We will argue later that lines without arrow heads realize a particular kind of ‘analytical’ structure:
᭡ Fig 2.7 Conjoining participants
In the second model, ‘source’ and ‘encoder’ are compounded, welded together yet still distinct components of the whole:
᭡ Fig 2.8 Compounding of participants

· Narrative representations 53
The third possibility would be a complete fusion between ‘source’ and ‘encoder’. The shape of Riley and Riley’s ‘overall social system’ (ﬁgure 2.5) can be interpreted as such a fusion – a fusion of two circles and a box. Apparently participants can lose their separate identity to different degrees. When they are conjoined, the process, the act of connecting them, is still explicit, realized by a line. When they are compounded, their identities remain distinct, but there is no longer an explicitly expressed process to connect them. When they are fused, even their separate identities have disappeared. In speech and writing, with somewhat different means – for instance, stress and intonation – we can move from, say, The bird is black, which has two distinct participants as well as a connecting process (‘is’); to the black bird, which has black and bird still as different words, but removes the process; to the blackbird, in which two words have been fused to become one semantic entity/noun. Each successive step further obscures the act of predication, the explicit act of bringing the two participants together, until the structure is no longer ‘analytical’, no longer analysed or analysable. We make the point at some length because of the (ideological) signiﬁcance of this semiotic resource in conﬁguring the represented world.
᭡ Fig 2.9 Fusion of participants
As with many other kinds of diagram, the communication models we have used to illustrate this section are explained or paraphrased in the written texts that accompany them. But by no means everything that is expressed in the diagrams is also expressed in the written texts. Not all of the meanings conveyed visually are also conveyed verbally. The meanings of the visual shapes, the boxes and circles and triangles that give the participants their volume, for example, are almost always left unexplained. Older, common sense or theoretical notions, such as ‘illustration’ (images ‘illustrating’ verbal texts) or ‘explanation’ (words ‘explaining’ diagrams) are no longer an adequate account of the relations between words and pictures, here as in other instances. Why, in ﬁgure 2.6, is the ‘signal’ a circle, the ‘source’ a rectangle, the ‘encoder’ a triangle? Why, in ﬁgure 2.5, is the ‘primary group’ a rectangle, while the ‘larger social structure’ and the individuals ‘C’ and ‘R’ are circles? Why do Shannon and Weaver (ﬁgure 2.2) prefer angularity, while Riley and Riley prefer curvature (ﬁgure 2.5)?
There can be little doubt that such choices are charged with meaning. Basic geometrical shapes have always been a source of fascination, even of religious awe. Our scientiﬁc age is no exception. Circles, squares and triangles have been regarded as pure, quasi-scientiﬁc ‘atoms’ of the visible world, a ‘pure manifestation of the elements’, the ‘universal-as-themathematical’, as Mondrian said (quoted in Jaffé, 1967: 54–5). And they have been thought to have the power to directly affect our nervous system, for instance by the constructivist artist Gabo: ‘The emotional force of an absolute shape is unique and not

· 54 Narrative representations
replaceable by any other means. . . . Shapes exult and shapes depress, they elate and make desperate’ (quoted in Nash, 1974: 54). As we are here primarily concerned with the relations between participants, this subject falls somewhat outside our main concern; it deserves a separate study. But given the semiotic and ideological (mythical) signiﬁcance of these aspects, we will at least indicate the issues with which such a study might be concerned.
In contemporary Western society, squares and rectangles are the elements of the mechanical, technological order, of the world of human construction. They dominate the shape of our cities, our buildings, our roads. They dominate the shape of many of the objects we use in daily life, including our pictures, which nowadays rarely have a round or oval frame, though other periods were happy to use these to frame more intimate portraits in particular. Unlike circles, which are self-contained, complete in themselves, rectangular shapes can be stacked, aligned with each other in geometrical patterns: they form the modules, the building blocks with which we construct our world, and they are therefore the dominant choice of builders and engineers, and of those who think like builders and engineers. In art, they are the choice of geometrical abstractionists, artists for whom art has to be, above all, rational. As Mondrian wrote in the 1920s,
In all ﬁelds life grows increasingly abstract while it remains real. More and more the machine displaces natural power. In fashion we see a characteristic tensing of form and intensiﬁcation of colour, signifying the departure from the natural.
In modern dance steps (boston, tango, etc.) the same tensing is seen: the curved line of the old dance (waltz etc.) has yielded to the straight line, and each movement is immediately neutralized by a counter-movement – signifying the search for equilibrium. Our social life shows this too: autocracy, imperialism with its (natural) rule of power, is about to fall – if it has not fallen already – and yields to the (spiritual) power of law.
Likewise the new spirit comes strongly forward in logic, science and religion. The imparting of veiled wisdom yields to the wisdom of pure reason; and knowledge shows increasing exactness. The old religion, with its mysteries and dogmas, is increasingly thrust aside by a clear relationship to the universal.
(quoted in Jaffé, 1967: 64)
Glosses in ‘dictionaries of visual symbols’ and similar publications tend to express the meaning of geometrical shapes in terms of intrinsic, abstract qualities, but they point in the same direction. According to Dondis (1973: 44), the square represents ‘honesty, straightness and workmanlike meaning’; according to Thompson and Davenport (1982: 110), it ‘represents the world and denotes order’.
Circles are glossed very differently in such dictionaries, as denoting ‘endlessness, warmth, protection’ (Dondis, 1973: 44), or as ‘the traditional symbol of eternity and the heavens’ (Thompson and Davenport, 1982: 110). But such descriptions can be multiplied endlessly: the more abstract the sign, the greater its semantic extension; or, to put it in our terms, the greater its potential range of uses as a signiﬁer in signs. We need to look for the

· Narrative representations 55
principles that unite these meanings, and for the fundamental oppositions between square and circle, between the angular and the curved. In nature, squareness does not exist. Mondrian admitted that his method of ‘abstracting the curve’ made it difﬁcult to represent nature: ‘In painting a tree, I progressively abstracted the curve; you can understand that very little “tree” remained’ (quoted in Jaffé, 1967: 120). Circles and curved forms generally are the elements we associate with an organic and natural order, with the world of organic nature – and such mystical meanings as may be associated with them derive from this. Angularity we associate with the inorganic, crystalline world, or with the world of technology, which is a world we have made ourselves, and therefore a world we can, at least in principle, understand fully and rationally. The world of organic nature is not of our making, and will always retain an element of mystery. Curved forms are therefore the dominant choice of people who think in terms of organic growth rather than mechanical construction, in terms of what is natural rather than in terms of what is artiﬁcial. In art, it is the choice of what is sometimes called ‘biomorphic abstractionalism’ – the curves, blobs and bulges in the paintings of Hans Arp or the sculptures of Henry Moore.
The values attached to these poles of meaning – that is, the actual signs produced with the signiﬁers of the ‘technological’ and the ‘natural’ – do, of course, differ. The square can connote the ‘technological’ positively, as a source of power and progress, or negatively, as a source of oppression which, literally and ﬁguratively, ‘boxes us in’. In Riley and Riley’s communication model (ﬁgure 2.5) society is represented as a natural order, organically evolved rather than humanly constructed. But the ‘primary groups’ are depicted as rectangles. Perhaps this betrays an unconscious bias in favour of modern urban society, a view in which the small, close-knit community in which everyone knows everything about everyone is seen as oppressive, and the ‘larger social structure’ as liberating, providing the individual with anonymity, and thereby with autonomy and selfcontainment, choice and freedom. For Riley and Riley, individuals hail from ‘primary groups’ (and are still connected to them, albeit tenuously), but then go their own way, leaving the ‘primary groups’ behind, and moving freely in and out of the ‘larger social structures’, in a socially mobile world. This example shows that diagrams, rational and scientiﬁc as they may seem, can convey meanings visually that are not necessarily also conveyed verbally.
The triangle is angular, like the square – an element of the mechanical, technological order. But, unlike the square, the triangle, especially when tilted, is a (fused structure of a) participant and a vector, because it can convey directionality, point at things. The meanings it attracts are therefore less like ‘qualities of being’ than like processes, as in the well-known revolutionary poster by El Lissitzky (ﬁgure 2.10), in which the revolution, represented by a red triangle, is an active, dynamic force, wedging itself into the inert, self-contained, ‘organic’ society of White Russia.
In diagrams, triangles can similarly introduce a sense of process. The triangles in ﬁgure 2.6, for instance, could be seen as ‘focusing’ or ‘aiming’ the ‘message’ (we have already indicated why it is so difﬁcult to give verbal transcodings of visual processes and we will discuss this more fully later). Not surprisingly, glosses of the meanings of triangles in visual dictionaries reﬂect this dynamic quality. Triangles are ‘a symbol of generative power’

(Thompson and Davenport, 1982: 110), and represent ‘action, conﬂict, tension’ (Dondis, 1973: 44).
The meanings of the basic geometrical shapes, then, are motivated in two ways. First, they derive from the properties of the shapes or, rather, from the values given to these properties in speciﬁc social and cultural contexts. The straight line, for instance, means what it literally is: ‘straight’. This ‘straightness’ may then be used to carry any one of a vast range of meanings compatible with that. It may be positively valued in one context (e.g. the ‘straight and narrow path’, or Mondrian’s association of straightness with the ‘spiritual power of law’), less positively in another (e.g. ‘the straight man’ as opposed to the ‘funny man’, or ‘straight’ as opposed to ‘gay’). The producers of an image have their interests in making the visual sign, and this makes the meaning of the image quite speciﬁc for the producer; it colours in and makes speciﬁc the abstract meanings that derive from the inherent properties of the shapes and from the histories of their cultural uses. Rectangles can be stacked – and, again, this may be positively valued in one context, say in urban planning, or in geometric abstractionism; and less positively in another, say in countercultures that dream of living in geodesic domes, or in biomorphic abstractionism.
Second, these meanings derive from the common qualities we may detect in such objects in our environment as would be circular or rectangular when abstracted to their underlying basic shape, and from the values attached to these qualities in different social

· Narrative representations 57
contexts. The sun, the moon, the belly of the pregnant woman, are curved. The skyscraper, the executive desk, the expensive briefcase, are rectangular. Such common qualities as we may see in these groups of objects (say, ‘nature’s cycles’ and ‘male power’) will evidently be read and valued differently in different social contexts – and the groupings of objects from which we derive these meanings are likely to be made selectively, so as to obtain the common qualities sought.
Finally, our argument suggests that the semiotic genesis of diagrams lies, not just in technical drawing, but also in art, and speciﬁcally in the abstract art movements of our century, which no longer ﬁll out and corporealize the schematic reductions which naturalistic artists have used for centuries, and which, if the Gestaltists are right, underlie all visual representation.
From the basic shapes other geometrical shapes can be derived: square, circle and triangle can be horizontally or vertically elongated to different degrees; and the square, the triangle and all elongated shapes can be tilted, either towards the right or towards the left. Vertical elongation creates a more pronounced distinction between top and bottom, and hence a bias towards hierarchy, and towards ‘opposition’ generally (what is most important or otherwise dominant goes on top, what is less important or dominant is relegated to the bottom). Horizontal elongation causes a shape to lean towards the kind of structure in which what is positioned on the left is presented as ‘Given’, as information that is already familiar to the reader and serves as a ‘departure point’ for the message, while what is positioned on the right is presented as ‘New’, as information not yet known to the reader, and hence deserving his or her special attention. The shape of Schramm’s ‘ﬁeld of experience’ and ‘signal’ in the second diagram of ﬁgure 2.6, for instance, suggests that these participants are, at least potentially, endowed with such an information structure. Tilting, ﬁnally, creates oblique lines and hence a sense of vectoriality. In Malevich’s Supremacist Composition: Red Square and Black Square (ﬁgure 2.11) the participants are represented as squares. But because the red square is tilted, the painting is structurally more similar to El Lissitzky’s Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge (ﬁgure 2.10) than, for instance, to Mondrian’s compositions of red, yellow and blue squares: it is about dynamic’ action, whereas Mondrian’s compositions are about a stable order, a ‘search for equilibrium’ – the red square seems to move away from the oppressively large black square.1
Finally, it is important to stress the essential interchangeability of visual and verbal participants in diagrams, and, indeed, in many other visual genres. Although the processes and structures in diagrams are always visual, the participants which they relate to each other may be of different kinds: pictures, naturalistic or schematic; abstract shapes, with or without verbal labels; words, either enclosed or not enclosed in boxes or other shapes; letters; and so on. The same thing can be seen in page layout: the participants are heterogeneous. They can be verbal (headlines, blocks of copy, etc.), but the semiotic means which bring them together into a coherent semantic structure are always visual. The key to understanding such texts therefore lies above all in an understanding of the visual semiotic means which are used to weld these heterogeneous elements into a coherent whole, into a text. Visual structures relate visual elements to each other; these visual elements, however, may themselves be heterogeneous – a word as a visual element, a block of written text as

a visual element, an image as a visual element, a number or an equation as a visual element.
NARRATIVE PROCESSES
When participants are connected by a vector, they are represented as doing something to or for each other. From here on we will call such vectorial patterns narrative – in Kress and van Leeuwen (1990) we used the term ‘presentational’ – and contrast them to conceptual patterns (see ﬁgure 2.12). Where conceptual patterns represent participants in terms of their class, structure or meaning, in other words, in terms of their generalized and more or less stable and timeless essence, narrative patterns serve to present unfolding actions and events, processes of change, transitory spatial arrangements.
The hallmark of a narrative visual ‘proposition’ is the presence of a vector: narrative structures always have one, conceptual structures never do. In pictures, these vectors are formed by depicted elements that form an oblique line, often a quite strong, diagonal line, as in ‘The British used guns’ (in ﬁgure 2.1), where the guns and the outstretched arms of the British form such a line. The vectors may be formed by bodies or limbs or tools ‘in action’, but there are many other ways to turn represented elements into diagonal lines of action. A road running diagonally across the picture space, for instance, is also a vector, and the car driving on it an ‘Actor’ in the process of ‘driving’. In abstract images such as diagrams, narrative processes are realized by abstract graphic elements – for instance, lines with an explicit indicator of directionality, usually an arrowhead. Such features of directionality must always be present if the structure is to realize a narrative representation: connecting lines without an indicator of directionality form a particular kind of analytical structure, and mean something like ‘is connected to’, ‘is conjoined to’, ‘is related to’.
The ‘Actor’ is the participant from whom or which the vector departs, and which may be fused with the vector to different degrees. In Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge (ﬁgure 2.10), for instance, the red triangle is both participant and vector, and represents both the ‘wedge’ and the act of wedging in (or ‘beating’, as the title has it). In ﬁgure 2.13, taken from a factual children’s book about France (Bender, 1988), the Actors are realized by the colour of the arrows (the ‘Gulf Stream’ vector is red, the ‘Mistral’ vector blue), and by their volume (they are not just thin lines), and the narrative processes are realized by
᭡ Fig 2.12 Main types of visual representational structure

· 60 Narrative representations
᭡ Fig 2.13 Gulf Stream and Mistral (Bender, 1988)
their vectoriality. In Shannon and Weaver’s (1949) communication model (ﬁgure 2.2), on the other hand, Actor and process are realized by separate visual elements, the Actor by a box (‘information source’), the process by an arrow. Pictures like ‘The British used guns’ (in ﬁgure 2.1) occupy, perhaps, an intermediate position.
In the case of ‘realist’ images, the context usually makes clear what kind of action the vectors represent. ‘The British used guns’ (in ﬁgure 2.1) can be translated – should we wish or need to do so – not so much with ‘used’, as the caption has it, as with something like ‘The British stalk the Aborigines with their guns’. Other possibilities exist, but the ﬁeld is limited. The vectors in abstract pictures are more difﬁcult to transcode. One ﬁrst needs to formulate what they, literally, formally, do. This can then help to circumscribe the ﬁeld of possible readings. The triangle in El Lissitzky’s Beat the Whites with the Red Wedge (ﬁgure 2.10) literally wedges itself into the white circle. This opens up a perhaps large, but by no means inﬁnite, range of possible readings: the triangle can be said to ‘pierce’ or ‘inﬁltrate’ or ‘destabilize’ the circle. In fact it does all these things – the process represents a ﬁeld of possible meanings. In the case of Malevich’s Suprematist Composition: Red Square and Black Square (ﬁgure 2.11), the red square literally tilts away from the black square above it. How can we transcode this? Does the red square ‘ﬂee from’ or ‘point away

· Narrative representations 61
from’ the black square? Is it ‘ejected from’ or ‘discarded by’ it? All these readings are legitimate. The point is that each reading will have the small red square as the mobile participant, however much it is dominated by the big, heavy black square, and the black square as static, motionless and monolithic. The picture tells the story of an ‘underling’ escaping from, or being expelled from, the monolithic power of the black square. Who or what this underling or these forces are the readers will produce in the process of reading, although the shapes and colours will point them in a certain direction, make certain readings more plausible, more like those of the producer’s than others.
In the case of diagrams it is also difﬁcult to say in words just what kind of action the vectors represent. The common sense view of the function of images as ‘illustration’ and ‘explanation’ would be that the accompanying verbal text explains what is not made clear visually. But usually this is not so. Usually the process is represented only visually, and the written text either does not paraphrase it at all, or provides contradictory or even misleading glosses. The Shannon and Weaver communication model has been ‘quoted’ and verbally explained in many books and articles, for instance in Watson and Hill’s Dictionary of Communication and Media Studies (1980), which has a 250-word entry about the model, and in a Scientiﬁc American article by Pierce, a telecommunications engineer (1972). The ﬁrst gives the following indications of the meaning of the vectors: the authors say that the model ‘can be applied to any information transfer system’ and they call it a ‘process centred model’ (1980: 149, our italics) – two rather oblique references, one a broad gloss (‘process’), the other only slightly more speciﬁc (‘transfer’). Pierce’s explanations are contradictory. On the one hand, he calls the model a ‘system’ (as do Watson and Hill in the dictionary) and paraphrases it in terms of an analytical rather than a narrative structure: ‘The system consists of an information source, a transmitter, a communication channel, a noise source, a receiver and a message destination’ (1972: 32, our italics) – note that he lists only the participants, not the processes. On the other hand, when he gives an example, he paraphrases the vectors by means of active verbs:
A human being may type a message consisting of the letters and spaces on the keyboard of a teletypewriter. The teletypewriter serves as a transmitter that encodes each character as a sequence of electrical pulses, which may be ‘on’ or ‘off’, ‘current’ or ‘no current’. These electrical pulses are transmitted by a pair of wires to another teletypewriter that acts as a receiver and prints out the letters and spaces.
(Pierce, 1972: 33, our italics)
These are just two examples where others are possible. The meaning potential of diagrammatic vectors is broad, abstract and hence difﬁcult to put into words. The accompanying texts tend to be much more explicit about participants, about things existing in space (or represented as though they are), than about processes, events and actions. Scientiﬁc and bureaucratic writing, and many forms of expository writing generally, put most of their meaning in the nouns rather than in the verbs. Verbs, in these forms of language, remain restricted to a relatively small set of (logical) connectors (‘is’, ‘has’, ‘leads to’, ‘causes’, ‘generates’, ‘develops into’, and so on), almost as though they were ‘function words’, like

· 62 Narrative representations
articles and pronouns, rather than ‘content words’. In his book Factual Writing (1985: 40), Martin gives an example:
There is little doubt that television coverage of a domestic slaughtering operation, conducted in a government approved abattoir, which involved the slaughter of lambs, calves and swine, would generate a good deal of public revulsion and protest.
In this extract most of the speciﬁc actions appear in noun form, and some have been nominalized; that is, turned into nouns from prior full clausal forms (‘doubt’, ‘coverage’, ‘slaughtering operation’, ‘slaughter’, ‘revulsion’, ‘protest’). In a text of thirty-seven words, there are only two main verbs (‘is’ and ‘generate’), both very general. Doings and happenings have been turned into things. The dynamics of action has been changed into a static of relations. Diagrams do something similar. They represent events which take place over time as spatial conﬁgurations, and so turn ‘process’ into ‘system’ – or into something ambiguously in between, something that can be called either ‘system-centred’ or ‘process-centred’. In this respect diagrams are akin to certain forms of nominalizing writing, while naturalistic images, with their human participants and their more concrete, speciﬁc processes, are more akin to story-writing. Like many naturalistic images, stories are about human or animate beings and the things they do, and in stories much more meaning is put into verbs than in most non-narrative forms of writing.
Because their meaning is so abstract and general, vectors can represent fundamentally different processes as though they were the same (for instance, ‘humans typing letters and spaces on a keyboard’ and ‘teletypewriters transmitting electrical pulses’). Diagrams of the Shannon and Weaver type can impose two models of interpretation on one situation or perhaps one model on many; here the two models are ‘transport’ and ‘transformation’. Figure 2.2 represents what is going on either as transport, movement from one place to another, or as the more or less causally determined transformation from one thing into another. And because one sign, the arrow, can represent both, the two meanings often become conﬂated: movement, transport is transformation; mobility is the cause of, and condition for, change, growth, evolution, progress. The Shannon and Weaver model, for instance, represents communication as transport, as moving information from one place to another, but it also and at the same time represents communication as the transformation of messages into signals, of ‘letters and spaces’ into ‘electrical pulses’.
The arrows in the ‘system networks’ of systemic-functional grammar (our diagram in ﬁgure 2.12 is such a ‘system network’) are usually transcoded by ‘choose’ or ‘select’ (e.g. ‘ “Conceptual” selects “Classiﬁcational”, “Analytical” or “Symbolical” ’). But visually the process is, again, a combination of transport and transformation. And when such networks are turned into computer programs, as indeed they have been, the visual metaphor becomes a reality in which there are not people ‘choosing’ between ‘options’, but pulses transported to points at which a change of state occurs. At that point the schematic reduction of one semiotic reality has turned into a blueprint for another, new semiotic reality, and people will have been reduced to the role of ‘source’ and ‘destination’ in an

· Narrative representations 63
autonomized and exteriorized semiotic process, just as they are in Shannon and Weaver’s communication model.
Different kinds of narrative process can be distinguished on the basis of the kinds of vector and the number and kind of participants involved.
1 Action processes The Actor is the participant from which the vector emanates, or which itself, in whole or in part, forms the vector (as with the triangle in ﬁgure 2.10). In images they are often also the most salient participants, through size, place in the composition, contrast against background, colour saturation or conspicuousness, sharpness of focus, and through the ‘psychological salience’ which certain participants (e.g. the human ﬁgure and, even more so, the human face) have for viewers. In ﬁgure 2.1, for instance, the British are larger than the Aborigines, and placed in the foreground. In the Shannon and Weaver communication model (ﬁgure 2.2), the ‘information source’ and the ‘noise source’ are Actors (we will comment on their different position in the diagram, and on the different directionality of their arrows, in chapter 6):
When images or diagrams have only one participant, this participant is usually an Actor. The resulting structure we call non-transactional. The action in a non-transactional process has no ‘Goal’, is not ‘done to’ or ‘aimed at’ anyone or anything. The nontransactional action process is therefore analogous to the intransitive verb in language (the verb that does not take an object). The processes in ﬁgure 2.13 are non-transactional: the water of the Gulf Stream does not move something, it just moves; and the wind of the Mistral does not blow something, it just blows. This visual representation is akin to the way meteorological processes are represented in English; it rains, or it snows. As Halliday has pointed out (1985: 102), other languages do not necessarily do this. In one Chinese dialect, for instance, one has to say something like ‘the sky is dropping water’; in other words, raining has to be represented as a transactive process. In ﬁgure 2.15, the gesture of the old man forms a vector, but he does not gesture towards anyone or anything, at least not so far as we can see in this picture. As a result, the viewer is left to imagine who or what he may be communicating with. Is he already in touch with what lies beyond life? Is that why the young boy looks at him with such concentrated fascination?
᭡ Fig 2.14 Actors

· 64 Narrative representations

At other times, there is only a vector and a Goal (ﬁgure 2.16). The Goal is the participant at whom or which the vector is directed, hence it is also the participant to whom or which the action is done, or at whom or which the action is aimed.
Representations of actions which include only the Goal we will call Events: something is happening to someone, but we cannot see who or what makes it happen. Figure 2.17 shows a diagram which appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald during the ﬁrst Gulf War. A vector represents the action of moving towards the town of Khafji, and the Goal is the town of Khafji itself, represented by a black dot. But nothing represents the war planes which are moving towards Khafji. Closely related is the case in which just a small part of the Actor is visible, a hand, or a foot, so that the Actor becomes anonymous. In both cases there is in fact an Actor, as in ﬁgure 2.17, but the Actor is either deleted from the representation or made anonymous, a visual analogue, perhaps, of ‘passive agent deletion’, a linguistic form of representation that plays an important role in critical linguistics and critical discourse analysis, as when a newspaper headline says, ‘Fifteen Demonstrators Shot in Riots’, thereby omitting to mention that they were shot by police (Trew, 1979: 97ff).
When a narrative visual proposition has two participants, one is the Actor, the other the Goal. The Actor in such a transactional process is not so much the participant which moves (as in the non-transactional process) as the participant which instigates the movement, and if we had to give a verbal paraphrase of a transactional process we would probably use
᭡ Fig 2.16 Goal

· Narrative representations 65
᭡ Fig 2.17 Gulf War Diagram (Sydney Morning Herald, 14 February 1991)
a transitive verb, a verb that takes an object (e.g. ‘transport’ or ‘send’ instead of [intransitive] ‘move’).
In ‘The British used guns’ (ﬁgure 2.1), the two men are the Actor, the Aborigines are the Goal. There is, in fact, a second transactional process: there are also vectors formed by lines that can be drawn from the heads of the Aborigines to the ﬁre, and so constitute a process in which the Aborigines are the Actor and the ﬁre the Goal. ‘The Aborigines surround the ﬁre’, one could transcode. But the point is not to ﬁnd a verbal equivalent; the point is to establish that the Aborigines are represented as Actor and the ﬁre as Goal. Because of its smaller size and placement further towards the background, this process is a ‘minor process’, embedded in the major process. The whole could be transcoded as ‘The British stalk the Aborigines, who surround the ﬁre’.
It is possible to argue that structures such as the Shannon and Weaver diagram (ﬁgure 2.2) have been affected by the fact that Western culture gives such centrality to language that the structure of English, with its lexical distinction of verbs/processes and nouns/ objects, may have acted as a model for a semiotic schema. So arrows as vectors/processes and boxes as participants/nouns may be a more or less unconscious translation from

· 66 Narrative representations
language into the visual. However, it is important here to insist on the distinct organization of the two modes. The visual structure of arrows and boxes conveys a strong sense of ‘impacting’ or ‘targeting’, which is quite absent in the verbal translations which come most immediately to mind. The visual structure foregrounds procedure over substantive content, the act of ‘impacting’ over what makes the impact, more or less in the way that, for instance, marketing experts are often more concerned about strategies for reaching consumers than about the goods and services that should reach them, or that pedagogic experts are more concerned about the format of classroom interaction than about the content of lessons.
᭡ Fig 2.18 Speech circuit (de Saussure 1974 [1916])
Some transactional structures are bidirectional, each participant playing now the role of Actor, now the role of Goal, as for instance in de Saussure’s well-known ‘speech circuit’ diagram (ﬁgure 2.18) in which ‘A’ and ‘B’ are now speaker, now listener. It is not always clear whether bidirectional transactions are represented as occurring simultaneously or in succession, although there is a tendency to use one arrow with two heads to signify simultaneity, and two arrows pointing in different directions to signify sequentiality. In ﬁgure 2.18, for instance, sequentiality is realized by two separate dotted lines (line and arrowhead, connection and directionality, are separate elements in this diagram).
᭡ Fig 2.19 Simultaneous and sequential bidirectionality
We will refer to the participants in such structures as Interactors, to indicate their double role.

· Narrative representations 67
2 Reactional processes When the vector is formed by an eyeline, by the direction of the glance of one or more of the represented participants, the process is reactional, and we will speak not of Actors, but of Reacters, and not of Goals, but of Phenomena. The Reacter, the participant who does the looking, must necessarily be human, or a human-like animal – a creature with visible eyes that have distinct pupils, and capable of facial expression. The Phenomenon may be formed either by another participant, the participant at whom or which the Reacter is looking, or by a whole visual proposition, for example, a transactional structure. In ﬁgure 2.15, for instance, the old man and his gesture form the Phenomenon, while the young boy is the Reacter. In ﬁgure 2.20, an advertisement for mineral water, the man is Actor in a transactional action process in which the water is Goal (‘The man drinks water’, one might transcode): the whole angle of his body forms a strong vector between the two represented participants. This process (‘Man drinks water’) then becomes the Phenomenon of a reactional structure in which the woman is Reacter – a vector, formed by the direction of her glance and the angle of her left arm, leads from her to the drinking man. She reacts to his action with a smile of approval (the precise nature of reactions is coloured in by facial expression). The man as doer, the woman as faithful admirer of his actions, is a distribution of roles which, as Goffman has shown in his Gender Advertisements (1976), is very common in advertisements (but not only in advertisements): ‘When a man and a woman

· 68 Narrative representations
collaborate in an undertaking, the man is likely to perform the executive role’ (Goffman, 1976: 32).
Like actions, reactions can be transactional or non-transactional. In the latter case there is no Phenomenon, as is the case with the look of the old man in ﬁgure 2.15. It is then left to the viewer to imagine what he or she is thinking about or looking at, and this can create a powerful sense of empathy or identiﬁcation with the represented participants. Sometimes photographers or picture editors crop photos back to close-ups of nontransactional Reacters who look bored, or animated, or puzzled, at something we cannot see. This can become a source of representational manipulation. A caption may, for instance, suggest what the Reacter is looking at, but, needless to say, it need not be what the Reacter was actually looking at when the picture was taken. Stuart Hall (1982) has described how this kind of manipulation is used in press photographs of politicians.
3 Speech process and mental process
A special kind of vector can be observed in comic strips: the oblique protrusions of the thought balloons and dialogue balloons that connect drawings of speakers or thinkers to their speech or thought. Until recently they were conﬁned to the comic strips, although there have, of course, also been speech processes in medieval art, for instance in the form of ribbons emanating from the speaker’s mouth. Today they increasingly crop up in other contexts, too; for instance, in connection with quotes in school textbooks or on the screens of automatic bank tellers. Like transactional reactions, these processes connect a human (or animate) being with ‘content’, but where in transactional reactions it is the content of a perception, in the case of thought bubbles and similar devices it is the content of an inner mental process (thought, fear, etc.), and in the case of speech vectors the content of the speech. Halliday (1985: 227ff.) calls this kind of structure ‘projective’. The Phenomenon of the transactional Reaction, and the content of the dialogue balloon or thought balloon are not represented directly, but mediated through a Reacter, a ‘Senser’ (in the case of a thought balloon) or a ‘Speaker’ (in the case of the dialogue balloon).
4 Conversion processes
The Shannon and Weaver communication model (ﬁgure 2.2) forms a chain of transactional processes. This chaining results in a third kind of participant, a participant which is the Goal with respect to one participant and the Actor with respect to another. Shannon and Weaver’s ‘transmitter’ is such a participant, acting as Goal with respect to the ‘information source’ and as Actor with respect to the ‘receiver’. We will call this kind of participant a Relay (our use of this term obviously differs from that of Barthes [1977], who uses it to denote an image–text relation in which the text extends, rather than elaborates [‘anchors’], the visual information). Relays do not just pass on, in unchanged form, what they receive; they always also transform it – for instance, in the case of communication models, from ‘letters and spaces’ into ‘electrical pulses’, or, as in ﬁgure 2.23, from ‘grasses, sedges and ﬂowers’ into ‘urine, droppings and dead carcasses’.

· Narrative representations 69
᭡ Fig 2.21 Relay
While the Shannon and Weaver model represents communication as a chained process with a beginning and an end, hence as an agentive process, a process set into motion by an Actor, other models, such as that shown in ﬁgure 2.22, represent communication as a cycle, and in that case all the participants are Relays, and agency is more weakly signiﬁed. This kind of process, which we will call a Conversion process, is especially common in representations of natural events; for instance, food chain diagrams or diagrammatic representations of the hydrological cycle. But, as ﬁgure 2.22 shows, it can also be applied to human (inter)action, and when this happens human (inter)action is represented as though it was a natural process.

5 Geometrical symbolism Figure 2.24, another ‘communication model’, does not include any participants. There is only a vector, indicating directionality by means of an ‘inﬁnity’ sign, rather than by means of an arrowhead. Dance’s diagram is in fact not so much a communication model as a ‘metadiagram’ which shows us a process in isolation, in order to discuss why helical vectors are more suitable for the representation of communication than, for instance, straight or
᭡ Fig 2.24 Communication model (from Dance, 1967)

· Narrative representations 71
curved arrows. Dance does this by pointing at the symbolic meanings of intrinsic properties of the helix. According to Dance, the shape of the helix:
combines the desirable features of the straight line and of the circle, while avoiding the weakness of either. . . . It gives testimony to the concept that communication, while moving forward, is at the same time coming back upon itself and being affected by its past behaviour, for the coming curve of the helix is fundamentally affected by the curve from which it emerges.
(Dance, 1967) Images of this kind use pictorial or abstract patterns as processes whose meanings are constituted by their symbolic values, and so extend the vectorial vocabulary by drawing our attention to possibilities beyond the diagonal action line or the simple arrow: coils, spirals, helixes.
Variants of the arrow may affect the meaning of the process in narrative diagrams. A curved arrow, for instance, partakes of the symbolic value of the circle, so that the process is represented as ‘natural’ and ‘organic’ (see ﬁgure 2.22). Vectors may also be attenuated, by the use of dotted lines, by making the arrowhead smaller or less conspicuous in other ways, or by placing it in the middle, rather than at the front of the line, which diminishes the sense of ‘impacting’ and ‘targeting’, and causes the meaning of the vector to move in the direction of mere connectivity (see ﬁgure 2.25).
᭡ Fig 2.25 Attenuated vectors
The vectorial relation may also be ampliﬁed, by means of bolder arrows (see ﬁgure 2.26), which perhaps suggest a certain density of ‘trafﬁc’, as in ﬁgure 2.17, the diagram of
᭡ Fig 2.26 Ampliﬁed vectors indicating density and frequency

· 72 Narrative representations
the attack on Khafji, or by the use of a number of arrows, which may suggest the frequency or multiplicity with which the process occurs.
In images a similar effect can be achieved by making the diagonal action lines more or less conspicuous, more or less dominant in the composition as a whole.
6 Circumstances
As we indicated in our discussion of ‘The British used guns’ (ﬁgure 2.1), narrative images may contain secondary participants, participants related to the main participants, not by means of vectors, but in other ways. We will refer to these participants, following Halliday (1985), as Circumstances. They are participants which could be left out without affecting the basic proposition realized by the narrative pattern, even though their deletion would of course entail a loss of information.
Locative Circumstances relate other participants to a speciﬁc participant we will call Setting. This requires a contrast between foreground and background, which can be realized in one or more of the following ways: (1) the participants in the foreground overlap, and hence partially obscure the Setting; (2) the Setting is drawn or painted in less detail (or, in the case of photography, has softer focus); (3) the Setting is more muted and desaturated in colour, with the various colours all tending towards the same hue, usually the blue of distance; (4) the Setting is darker than the foreground, or lighter, so that it acquires an ‘overexposed’, ethereal look. These formal features can occur in various combinations, and they are all gradients – ‘more-or-less’, rather than ‘either–or’, features.
As we will discuss in more detail in chapter 5, settings have importance for the realization of visual modality. The Settings themselves can of course be read as embedded analytical processes (‘The landscape consists of grass, trees and rocks’).
The tools used in action processes are often represented as Circumstances of Means. If this is the case, there is no clear vector between the tool and its user. The tools themselves may, of course, constitute the vectors which realize the action processes, as with the guns in ‘The British used guns’ (in ﬁgure 2.1), and they need not be objects. For instance, we would interpret the gesture of the old man in ﬁgure 2.15 as a non-transactional action (‘The old man addresses an unseen participant’), and his hands as a Circumstance of Means (‘The old man addresses an unseen participant with his hands’).
Figure 2.27 shows a penguin with her baby. There is again no vector to relate the two. Yet the penguin and her baby clearly form two distinct participants: this is a picture of a penguin with a baby. In such a case we will interpret the relation as a Circumstance of Accompaniment. As the picture contains no vector and displays the penguin more or less frontally, against a de-emphasized background, we interpret it as ‘analytical’, as the kind of picture more likely to illustrate a text giving descriptive information about penguins than a story about what penguins do.

SUMMARY Figure 2.28 summarizes the distinctions we have introduced in this section.2 Following Halliday (1985), we have called processes that can take a whole visual (or verbal) proposition as their ‘object’ projective, and the others non-projective. The square brackets indicate a single choice; for instance, ‘a transactional action is either unidirectional or bidirectional’. Our claim is that the ‘choices’ in ﬁgure 2.28 chart the principal ways in which images can represent the world ‘narratively’ – that is, in terms of ‘doing’ and ‘happening’.

A vector, formed by a (usually diagonal) depicted element, or an arrow, connects two participants, an Actor and a Goal. A vector, formed by a (usually diagonal) depicted element, or a double-headed arrow, connects two Interactors. A vector, formed by a (usually diagonal) depicted element, or an arrow, emanates from a participant, the Actor, but does not point at any other participant. The active participant in an action process is the participant from which the vector emanates or which is fused with the vector. The passive participant in an action process is the participant at which the vector is directed. The participants in a transactional action process where the vector could be said to emanate from, and be directed at, both participants. An eyeline vector connects two participants, a Reacter and a Phenomenon. An eyeline vector emanates from a participant, the Reacter, but does not point at another participant.

The passive participant in a (transactional) reaction is the participant at which the eyeline is directed; in other words, the participant which forms the object of the Reacter’s look. The same term is used for the participant (verbal or non-verbal) enclosed by a ‘thought bubble’. A process in which a participant, the Relay, is the Goal of one action and the Actor of another. This involves a change of state in the participant. A vector formed by a ‘thought bubble’ or a similar conventional device connects two participants, the Senser and the Phenomenon. The participant from whom the ‘thought bubble’ vector emanates. A vector formed by the arrow-like protrusion of a ‘dialogue balloon’ or similar device connects two participants, a Sayer and an Utterance. The participant in a verbal process from whom the ‘dialogue balloon’ emanates. The (verbal) participant enclosed in the ‘dialogue balloon’. The Setting of a process is recognizable because the participants in the foreground overlap and hence partially obscure it; because it is often drawn or painted in less detail, or, in the case of photography, has a softer focus; and because of contrasts in colour saturation and overall darkness or lightness between foreground and background. The Means of a process is formed by the tool with which the action is executed. It usually also forms the vector. An Accompaniment is a participant in a narrative structure which has no vectorial relation with other participants and cannot be interpreted as a Symbolic Attribute (see chapter 3).

VISUAL STRUCTURES AND LINGUISTIC STRUCTURES
We have drawn attention to the fact that, while both visual structures and verbal structures can be used to express meanings drawn from a common cultural source, the two modes are not simply alternative means of representing ‘the same thing’. It is easy to overemphasize either the similarity or the difference between the two modes. Only a detailed comparison can bring out how in some respects they realize similar types of meaning, though in different ways, while in other, perhaps most respects they represent the world quite differently, allowing the development of the different epistemologies we discussed in the previous chapter. In this brief ﬁnal section we wish to explore this in some detail with respect to narrative visual structures.
By comparison to the structures we will discuss in chapter 3, narrative visual structures are comparatively easy to ‘translate’; though, as we will see, there certainly is no one-toone correspondence. Like ‘non-transactional actions’, ‘one-participant material processes’ (Halliday, 1985: 103ff.) represent events as though they bear no relation to, and have no consequences for, participants other than the Actor. In Many people migrated one cannot add a second participant to this clause and say, for instance, Many people migrated their relatives, although one can of course add circumstances: Many people migrated to Australia. And, like ‘transactional actions’, ‘two-participant material processes’ (Halliday, 1985: 103ff.) involve two participants (e.g. Migrants invaded Australia). But linguistic ‘Events’ and visual ‘Events’ are quite different. Linguistic Events have processes that are ‘happenings’ which cannot have an Actor, as in Many of my relatives died. In the case of visual Events, the Actor is left out, but could have been used. They are the equivalent of passives with agent deletion, of clauses like Many of my relatives were killed, rather than of clauses like Many of my relatives died. To show someone dying it is necessary to show someone being killed, or to show someone performing an action that represents his or her death. Also, while in English many processes can take a third participant, the ‘Beneﬁciary’ (traditionally ‘indirect object’ in, e.g., Mary gave him the book), in images the possibility of such a third participant does not exist. What is a Beneﬁciary in English becomes a Goal in images (‘she message-sends him’ instead of ‘she sends him a message’).
On the other hand, English lacks the visual mode’s structural devices to represent events as cyclical (although linguistic participants can have a double role in English – for instance, in examples like He made them do it, where them is Goal of make do as well as Actor of do; cf. Halliday, 1985: 153). Nor is there an ‘interactional’ process. To realize what we have called ‘Interactors’, English would have to make use of reﬂexive pronouns. Consider, for instance, the problem of trying to ‘translate’ ﬁgure 2.18, de Saussure’s ‘speech circuit’ diagram, into English. A single visual process indicates something for which, in English, we need at least four clauses: ‘A speaks to B’, ‘B speaks to A’, ‘A listens to B’, ‘B listens to A’. How can one render this in one clause? ‘A and B communicate with each other’? But that causes ‘A’ and ‘B’ to lose their separate identity, transforming a reciprocal, bidirectional transaction into a jointly authored non-transactional action.
What we have called the ‘non-transactional reaction’ is in some ways akin to what Halliday calls the behavioural process (1985: 128), a process type which can take only one

participant (who must be human) and serves to realize a restricted ﬁeld of action, the ﬁeld of ‘physiological and psychological behaving’ (1985: 128). But the meanings of visual ‘non-transactional reactions’ form a more restricted ﬁeld, tied up as they are with one kind of behaviour – looking.
Projective processes – that is, mental and verbal processes – play an important part in English, and it is possible to distinguish a number of different types of each on the basis of formal grammatical criteria (Halliday, 1985: 106ff., 129). Mental processes, for instance, include processes of perception (‘see’, ‘hear’, etc.), processes of affection (‘like’, ‘fear’, ‘wish’, etc.) and processes of cognition (‘know’, ‘think’, ‘believe’, etc.). Each has a Senser, the person who does the seeing, or liking, or knowing (this has to be a person, or a participant represented as human), and a Phenomenon, someone or something seen, or liked, or known, by the Senser. Phenomena may be realized by participants or whole structures, just as in the case of images. In Many people want to migrate to Australia, the clause to migrate to Australia is Phenomenon; this sets mental processes apart from actions and transactions, which cannot have a clause as Goal. But what we have called the ‘transactional reaction’ can, if one wishes or needs to, be related to only a subset of the perception process, because non-visual Phenomena cannot directly be realized in the visual semiotic. Mental processes form, as we have shown, only a minor category in the visual semiotic; as far as we can see, there are no structural visual devices for making the strong distinction between ‘cognition’ and ‘affection’ processes that has come to characterize the ideational resources of English. The cinema, however, has developed a fairly extensive set of projective conventions for realizing different kinds of mental processes such as memories, dreams, hallucinations, and so on.
In English, verbal processes differ from mental processes in that they do not need a human ‘Sayer’ (one can say The document said that . . ., but not The document thought that . . .). On the other hand, like mental processes, they can take whole clauses as their object, and this in two different ways – in the form of Reported Speech (as in He said [that] he had no idea) and in the form of Quoted Speech (as in He said ‘I have no idea’). There seems to be no direct, structural way of expressing this kind of difference visually. ‘Dialogue balloons’ always quote.
We have identiﬁed only three different types of circumstance in images: location, means and accompaniment. All three exist in English (Halliday, 1985: 137ff.), but there they are by no means the only types. English allows all kinds of information to be added to the basic narrative proposition conveyed by the process (‘What happened?’) and the participants (‘Who or what was involved?’); information about time (‘When did it happen?’; ‘How long did it last?’); about purpose (‘What did it happen for?’); cause (‘Why did it happen?’) and so on.
The following table gives an overview of some of the correspondences between linguistic and visual narrative processes:

Comparisons such as these can highlight which ways of representing the world can be realized linguistically, which visually and which (more or less) in both ways. This, in turn, is useful as a background for analysing representation in multimodal texts: photographs and their captions, diagrams and their verbal glosses, stories and their illustrations. If, for instance, a diagram shows an arrow emanating from a participant labelled ‘environment’ and directed at another participant labelled ‘message’, then a ‘literal’ translation would be ‘the environment acts upon the message’. If the accompanying text says that the ‘communication process’ is ‘interacting with factors (or stimuli) from the environment’ (Watson and Hill, 1980: 14), it ‘mistranslates’, and the mistranslation is not due to the limitations of either English or visual communication. A literal ‘translation’ of ‘the source sends a message to the receiver’, on the other hand, is not possible: the spatial representation of verbally conceived ideas changes the ideas themselves, and vice versa. In the next chapter we will show further examples of this problem.

3 Conceptual representations: designing social constructs
CLASSIFICATIONAL PROCESSES
In the previous chapter we noted that visual structures of representation can either be narrative, presenting unfolding actions and events, processes of change, transitory spatial arrangements, or conceptual, representing participants in terms of their more generalized and more or less stable and timeless essence, in terms of class, or structure or meaning.
It is to the latter category of representational structures that we now turn, beginning with classiﬁcational processes. Classiﬁcational processes relate participants to each other in terms of a ‘kind of’ relation, a taxonomy: at least one set of participants will play the role of Subordinates with respect to at least one other participant, the Superordinate. We have already come across an example in the left-hand picture of ﬁgure 2.1, where the three participants – the axe, the basket and the wooden sword – were represented as ‘species’ of the same ‘genus’, as all belonging to the same overarching category. In this example the overarching category was not shown or named. The structure was a Covert Taxonomy, a taxonomy in which the Superordinate is inferred from such similarities as the viewer may perceive to exist between the Subordinates, or only indicated in the accompanying text, as in ﬁgure 3.1.
One visual characteristic is crucial in the realization of covert taxonomies: the proposed equivalence between the Subordinates is visually realized by a symmetrical composition. The Subordinates are placed at equal distance from each other, given the same size and the same orientation towards the horizontal and vertical axes. To realize the stable, timeless nature of the classiﬁcation, the participants are often shown in a more or less objective, decontextualized way. The background is plain and neutral. Depth is reduced or absent. The angle is frontal and objective. And frequently there are words inside the picture space. These features will be discussed in a later chapter under the heading ‘modality’.
Classiﬁcation processes do not, of course, simply reﬂect ‘real’, ‘natural’ classiﬁcations. For participants to be put together in a syntagm which establishes the classiﬁcation means that they were judged to be members of the same class, and to be read as such. ‘Naturalization’ is not natural, whether in images or in language. The ordering in the image itself produces the relations. This makes it possible for the producer of an image to classify baskets and weapons (ﬁgure 2.1), or zoologists, wildlife photographers and Aboriginal storytellers (ﬁgure 3.1) as being of the same order.
Covert taxonomies are often used in advertisements, where the photographs may, for instance, show arrangements of bottles that represent the variety of products marketed under a brand name, or arrangements of different people who all use the same product. Figure 3.2 is a page from Cosmopolitan magazine. What do these watches have in common? They all belong to the same Xpose range.

Other taxonomies show a higher degree of (explicit) ordering include a Superordinate. They represent and name the Superordinate within some kind of tree structure. In that structure the orientation is vertical, and the Superordinate is placed above or below the Subordinates, as in ﬁgure 3.2. The participants may be realized verbally, visually, or both verbally and visually, but the process is always visual.
Taxonomies do not have to be represented by formal diagrams with simple lines; they may be realized in more realist fashion, for instance, by an actual tree in a ‘family tree’. Overt taxonomies are usually ‘chained’, so that the ‘intermediate’ participants (e.g. the ‘inorganic substances’ and ‘organic substances’ of ﬁgure 3.3) will be Superordinate with respect to some of the other participants, and Subordinate with respect to others. To indicate this we will coin the term Interordinate. In other words, overt taxonomies have levels, and participants at the same level are represented as being, in some sense, ‘of the same kind’.
Tree structures, however, are not only used to realize ‘kind of’ relations. ‘Reporting diagrams’, showing the hierarchical structure of companies and other organizations, and genealogical or evolutionary trees, use the same structure. This means that visual grammar conﬂates, or at least represents as very closely related, what would, in language, be expressed by different means. Conceptual classiﬁcation is represented by the same

structure as social hierarchy; that is, the more general idea is represented as similar to greater power. As Virginia Woolf has said, ‘General ideas are always also Generals’ ideas.’ Further, hierarchies of concepts and hierarchies of social power are represented as similar to genealogies. In other words, the identity of an individual (or a species) is represented as being ‘subordinate’ to its ‘origins’ or ‘ancestors’ in the same way as speciﬁc concepts are subordinated to more general and abstract concepts, and lower employees or local bodies to managers or central organs.
Diagrammatic tree structures can take different forms. The branches of the tree may be parallel or oblique, straight or curved, and so on (see ﬁgure 3.4). Oblique branches

· Conceptual representations 83
abstract somewhat less from the shape of the tree than parallel branches, so that more of the symbolic meaning of the tree can be preserved. Hence they are common in contexts where a sense of ‘generation’ and ‘growth’ is connoted, as for instance in genealogies or in the diagrams used in ‘generative grammar’, a form of linguistics which posits that ‘surface structures’ are generated from (possibly innate and maybe universal) ‘deep structures’. The contrast between straight and curved branches is perhaps similar to that between participants represented as boxes and participants represented as circles or ovals (see chapter 2), a contrast between the ‘mechanical’ and ‘technological’ and the ‘natural’ and ‘organic’.
Many tree diagrams are inverted (‘bottom–up’), and when the branches are oblique the overall shape will tend towards that of a pyramid. Such structures are concerned with hierarchy and hierarchical difference rather than with clarity about levels: a reading of levels is possible, but not readily facilitated. Not all trees, however, are inverted. Sometimes the speciﬁc or, in the case of genealogies and evolutionary trees, the present, is placed on the top, depicting, for instance, humankind as the pinnacle of evolution rather than as being forever dominated by its lowly origins.
Although classiﬁcational structures represent participants in terms of their place in a static order, the verbal labels and explanations which may accompany them do not always do so. The term ‘reporting diagram’, for instance, uses an active process (‘report’) rather than a static one such as ‘is subordinate to’. Genealogies and evolutionary trees, similarly, may be glossed by verbs like ‘generates’, ‘evolves into’, ‘begets’, and so on. Visually, however, a hierarchical order is signiﬁed, a system. Thus the visual representation can blur the boundaries between the dynamic and the static. Is the dynamic in reality the instantiation or enactment of an underlying system? Or is the static the systemization and objectiﬁcation of a dynamic and ever-changing reality? Such questions become difﬁcult to answer in a mode which has erased the boundaries between the schema and the blueprint.
A similar blurring may occur between analytical (‘part of’) and classiﬁcational (‘kind of’) processes. The ‘stack diagram’ in ﬁgure 3.5 could be called classiﬁcational, and is in fact so rendered in the accompanying text: ‘to the Latin word /mus/ correspond two different things which we shall call x1 and x2’ (Eco, 1976b: 78). In other words, a ‘mouse’ is a kind of ‘mus’. But it can also be seen as analytical. One can also say that the meaning ‘mouse’ is part of the meaning of ‘mus’. And, most importantly, Eco has chosen the form of the analytical diagram.
