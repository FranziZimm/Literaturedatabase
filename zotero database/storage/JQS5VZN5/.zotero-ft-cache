PREFACE
As you may have guessed from the title, this book presents the linguistic theory known as Cognitive Grammar (CG). Research in CG began in 1976, and the basic framework of the theory has now existed for over a quarter century. Under the rubric “space grammar”, it was ﬁrst extensively described in Langacker 1982, whose numerous and unfortunately rather crudely drawn diagrams must have startled and dismayed the readers of Language. The most comprehensive statement of the theory resides in the hulking two-volume mass called Foundations of Cognitive Grammar (Langacker 1987, 1991). More accessible—or easier to lift at any rate—is Concept Image and Symbol (Langacker 1990), a collection of articles tailored as a single text. A second collection of this sort is Grammar and Conceptualization (Langacker 1999a). For ease of reference, these four books are cited here as FCG1, FCG2, CIS, and GC.
First proposed as a radical alternative to the theories then prevailing, CG may no longer seem so drastically different for the simple reason that the discipline has gradually evolved in its direction. There is no longer any clear distinction (if there ever was) between “formalist” and “functionalist” traditions in linguistic theory (Langacker 1999c). Nevertheless, CG is still regarded as extreme by most formalists, and even by many functionalists. And having been trained as a formalist, I myself ﬁrst placed it at the extreme periphery of the theoretical landscape. But after spending several decades in that outpost, I have come to see it as occupying the very center. I perceive it as striking the proper balance between formalist and functionalist concerns. It straightforwardly reﬂects the dual grounding of language in cognition and social interaction. I further see it as able to accommodate, integrate, and synthesize the wealth of ﬁndings and insights emerging in the varied traditions of cognitive and functional linguistics.
By now there are more opportunities for reading about CG and cognitive linguistics than you probably care to know about. Many references are cited in this book. To appreciate the full scope of the enterprise, you need only peruse the many volumes of Cognitive Linguistics (journal of the International Cognitive Linguistics Association) and the monograph series Cognitive Linguistics Research (Mouton de

viii PREFACE
Gruyter). And these are just the tip of the iceberg. Not yet available, though, are a broad selection of introductory textbooks. Several now exist for cognitive linguistics in general—Ungerer and Schmid 2007, Lee 2001, Croft and Cruse 2004, Evans and Green 2006—as well as two collections of readings (Geeraerts 2006; Evans, Bergen, and Zinken 2006) and a glossary (Evans 2007). For CG in particular, the only current option is Taylor 2002, which covers the basics quite well. Still lacking, however, is an introduction that is less elementary and presented in greater depth and technical detail. Here is my attempt to ﬁll this need.
The book is designed to be usable at different levels and in different ways. Though I have tried to make it accessible to general readers, some basic training in linguistics will be helpful. As a textbook, it is aimed at the advanced undergraduate and beginning graduate levels, having developed out of a course for ﬁrst-year graduate students. I see it as being ideally suited for a two-semester graduate course, parts I and II being covered in the ﬁrst semester, parts III and IV in the second. Parts I and II can also stand alone as a basic introduction to the theory. Their chapters are shorter and a bit less challenging, hence more suitable for less advanced students. The four parts do however form an integrated whole, which only collectively affords a real appreciation of CG’s vision of language structure and potential for describing it. This being a prime objective, the volume is not conceived exclusively as a textbook. It has enough linguistic depth and substance that it should prove useful for professionals in related disciplines. And for linguists of other theoretical persuasions, it offers a one-stop opportunity to put their assessment and criticisms on a ﬁrmer, more accurate basis.
On a personal level, this work brings closure to an initial phase of investigation that has stretched out for several decades. It has been a chance to reﬁne and clarify my thoughts on many issues, to present them more effectively, and to make their rationale more evident. This has led to a fuller, more uniﬁed treatment of the interactive and conceptual basis of language structure. There remain, to be sure, important gaps in coverage (e.g. a systematic exposition of phonology). And while the ﬁnal product is less than perfect (as reviewers will undoubtedly attest), it will have to do. Further attempts at presenting CG will concern a second phase of investigation, which has been under way for a number of years. Some of its major themes are previewed in part IV (Frontiers). The future is harder to predict than the past, but it does seem clear that—even after thirty years—research in CG is only starting.

Orientation
Our topic is the linguistic theory known as Cognitive Grammar. This frame-
work offers a comprehensive yet coherent view of language structure, with the further advantages (I would argue) of being intuitively natural, psychologically plausible, and empirically viable. It is nonetheless a decidedly nonstandard view for which orthodox training in linguistics gives little preparation. A presentation of Cognitive Grammar must therefore start by articulating its general nature and basic vision.
1.1 Grammar and Life
Having spent most of my life investigating grammar, I am quite aware that this passion is not shared by the general populace. Let’s face it—grammar has a bad reputation. For most people, it represents the danger of being criticized for breaking arcane rules they can never quite keep straight. In foreign-language instruction, grammar is often presented through mechanical exercises, the learning of irregularities, and the memorization of seemingly endless paradigms. Even in linguistics, it is commonly portrayed in a manner hardly designed to inspire general interest: as a system of arbitrary forms based on abstract principles unrelated to other aspects of cognition or human endeavor.
It doesn’t have to be that way. Grammar is actually quite engaging when properly understood. Linguists, of course, are concerned with describing language, not prescribing how to talk. They are not responsible for the artiﬁcial strictures enforced by would-be grammar police. While grammar does require the learning of many forms, the same is true of lexicon, which inspires much less dread and is often a source of wonder and amusement. Furthermore, portraying grammar as a purely formal system is not just wrong but wrong-headed. I will argue, instead, that grammar is meaningful. This is so in two respects. For one thing, the elements of grammar—like vocabulary items—have meanings in their own right. Additionally, grammar allows

PRELIMINARIES

us to construct and symbolize the more elaborate meanings of complex expressions (like phrases, clauses, and sentences). It is thus an essential aspect of the conceptual apparatus through which we apprehend and engage the world. And instead of being a distinct and self-contained cognitive system, grammar is not only an integral part of cognition but also a key to understanding it.
The meaningfulness of grammar becomes apparent only with an appropriate view of linguistic meaning. In cognitive semantics, meaning is identiﬁed as the conceptualization associated with linguistic expressions. This may seem obvious, but in fact it runs counter to standard doctrine. A conceptual view of meaning is usually rejected either as being insular—entailing isolation from the world as well as from other minds—or else as being nonempirical and unscientiﬁc. These objections are unfounded. Though it is a mental phenomenon, conceptualization is grounded in physical reality: it consists in activity of the brain, which functions as an integral part of the body, which functions as an integral part of the world. Linguistic meanings are also grounded in social interaction, being negotiated by interlocutors based on mutual assessment of their knowledge, thoughts, and intentions. As a target of analysis, conceptualization is elusive and challenging, but it is not mysterious or beyond the scope of scientiﬁc inquiry. Cognitive semantics provides an array of tools allowing precise, explicit descriptions for essential aspects of conceptual structure. These descriptions are based on linguistic evidence and potentially subject to empirical veriﬁcation.
Analyzing language from this perspective leads to remarkable conclusions about linguistic meaning and human cognition. Remarkable, ﬁrst, is the extent to which an expression’s meaning depends on factors other than the situation described. On the one hand, it presupposes an elaborate conceptual substrate, including such matters as background knowledge and apprehension of the physical, social, and linguistic context. On the other hand, an expression imposes a particular construal, reﬂecting just one of the countless ways of conceiving and portraying the situation in question. Also remarkable is the extent to which imaginative abilities come into play. Phenomena like metaphor (e.g. vacant stare) and reference to “virtual” entities (e.g. any cat) are pervasive, even in prosaic discussions of actual circumstances. Finally, these phenomena exemplify the diverse array of mental constructions that help us deal with—and in large measure constitute—the world we live in and talk about. It is a world of extraordinary richness, extending far beyond the physical reality it is grounded in.
Conceptual semantic description is thus a major source of insight about our mental world and its construction. Grammatical meanings prove especially revealing in this respect. Since they tend to be abstract, their essential import residing in construal, they offer a direct avenue of approach to this fundamental aspect of semantic organization. Perhaps surprisingly—given its stereotype as being dry, dull, and purely formal—grammar relies extensively on imaginative phenomena and mental constructions. Also, the historical evolution of grammatical elements yields important clues about the meanings of their lexical sources and semantic structure more generally. The picture that emerges belies the prevailing view of grammar as an autonomous formal system. Not only is it meaningful, it also reﬂects our basic experience of moving, perceiving, and acting on the world. At the core of grammatical meanings are mental operations inherent in these elemental components of

moment-to-moment living. When properly analyzed, therefore, grammar has much to tell us about both meaning and cognition.

1.2 The Nature of the Beast
The beast is Cognitive Grammar—CG for short. Some linguists view it with disdain, as it challenges fundamental dogmas and requires alternative modes of thought and analysis. Of course, others like it for just that reason. But whether they are positive, negative, or in-between, most opinions of CG appear to be formed on the basis of a strikingly limited (and often quite erroneous) understanding of it. Even its central claims and basic character are commonly misportrayed. So we need to get a few things straight at the outset.
1.2.1 An Outrageous Proposal
As its name implies, Cognitive Grammar is ﬁrst and foremost a theory of grammar. Rather surprising, therefore, are statements to the effect that “Langacker doesn’t believe in grammar—everything is semantics.” Rest assured that CG neither threatens nor denies the existence of grammar. Grammar exists. The issue is rather the nature of grammar and its relation to other dimensions of linguistic structure.
CG’s most fundamental claim is that grammar is symbolic in nature. What does this mean, exactly? Let us ﬁrst deﬁne a symbol as the pairing between a semantic structure and a phonological structure, such that one is able to evoke the other. A simple lexical item, such as skunk, is thus symbolic because it resides in the pairing between a meaning and a phonological shape. Grammar, of course, is concerned with how such elements combine to form complex expressions. The basic tenet of CG is that nothing beyond symbolic structures need be invoked for the proper characterization of complex expressions and the patterns they instantiate. More speciﬁcally: lexicon and grammar form a gradation consisting solely in assemblies of symbolic structures. An immediate consequence of this position is that all constructs validly posited for grammatical description (e.g. notions like “noun”, “subject”, or “past participle”) must in some way be meaningful.
This is not at all how grammar is viewed in modern linguistic theory. Received wisdom—repeated in every linguistics textbook—holds that notions like noun and subject are purely grammatical constructs not susceptible to any general semantic characterization. Moreover, the reigning theoretical orthodoxy claims that syntax is autonomous: that it constitutes a separate linguistic “module” or “component”, distinct from both lexicon and semantics, whose description requires a special set of syntactic “primitives”. Against this background, the CG position stands out as radical if not heretical. In the words of one distinguished critic: “Many readers will no doubt feel the same sense of outrage at this claim that I did, and I still believe that it is wrong” (Hudson 1992: 507–508).1

1 This critic does admit that I make “a surprisingly good case for it” (Hudson 1992: 508).

PRELIMINARIES

I have no doubt that this reviewer really did feel a sense of outrage and that other linguists share it. And to the extent that it causes outrage, the position is indeed outrageous. That does not make it wrong, however. It may only indicate that the distorting lenses of contemporary linguistic theory and professional training are able to disguise the very real sense in which the position is both natural and intrinsically desirable. If language serves a symbolic function, establishing systematic connections between conceptualizations and observable phenomena like sounds and gestures, it would seem both natural and desirable to seek an account such that grammar is itself symbolic. If notions like “noun” and “subject” are universal and fundamental to grammar, it would seem both dubious and implausible to deny them a conceptual raison d’être. From a naive perspective (i.e. for those who lack linguistic training), it is hard to fathom why our species would have evolved an autonomous grammatical system independent of conceptual and phonological content. Is it not more reasonable to suppose that grammar, rather than being separate and distinct, is merely the abstract commonality inherent in sets of symbolically complex expressions?
Assessments of CG’s central claim have been clouded by confusion on several points. One source of confusion is chronic ambivalence concerning what is meant by “autonomy”. A strong version of the autonomy thesis holds that syntactic description requires a special set of purely grammatical primitives, which are not reducible to anything more fundamental. CG denies this by claiming that all valid grammatical constructs are symbolic, hence reducible to form-meaning pairings. A weaker version of autonomy merely asserts that grammar cannot be fully predicted from independent factors (notably meaning and communicative constraints). This weak formulation is fully compatible with CG, and indeed, with virtually every brand of cognitive and functional linguistics. Few would disagree that semantic and functional considerations constrain and motivate grammatical structure but do not completely determine it—speakers still have to learn the speciﬁc patterns of their language, and linguists have to describe these explicitly. It should be evident that the weaker version of autonomy does not entail the stronger one: whether grammar is predictable, and the types of elements needed to describe it, are very different issues. Linguistic theorists sometimes confound them, however, by taking the nonpredictability of grammar as establishing autonomy in the broader sense.2 This overlooks the possibility of grammar being unpredictable yet fully describable as assemblies of symbolic structures.
Although the reduction of grammar to symbolic assemblies achieves an important conceptual uniﬁcation, some theorists worry about the fate of syntax. One critic complains that CG “denies it even the status of a deﬁnable area within the larger whole of language” (Harder 1996: 260). This erroneous statement betrays a double confusion. First, it confuses the deﬁnability of syntax with the existence of a clear and deﬁnite boundary. Overlap among lexicon, morphology, and syntax does not prevent us from deﬁning them and drawing useful distinctions, any more than the absence of a precise boundary between green and blue condemns

2 I call this the type/predictability fallacy. A prime example is Newmeyer 1983.

us to seeing only grue—a gradation does not imply undifferentiated homogeneity. Second, the statement confuses reduction with elimination. Reducing grammar to symbolic assemblies serves to characterize it, not to deny its status as a deﬁnable level of organization. One does not deny the existence of water molecules by analyzing them as consisting in a particular conﬁguration of hydrogen and oxygen atoms.

1.2.2 What Is CG Really Like?
Language is shaped and constrained by the functions it serves. These include the semiological function of allowing conceptualizations to be symbolized by means of sounds and gestures, as well as a multifaceted interactive function involving communication, manipulation, expressiveness, and social communion. Functional approaches to linguistic investigation are most basically distinguished from formal ones (notably generative grammar) in terms of whether functional considerations are taken as being foundational or merely subsidiary to the problem of describing language form. In practice, this matter of emphasis translates into very different substantive claims about the nature of linguistic structure and how to describe it.3
Cognitive Grammar belongs to the wider movement known as cognitive linguistics, which in turn is part of the functional tradition. Besides CG, important strands of cognitive linguistics include construction grammar, metaphor theory, the study of blends and mental spaces, and various efforts to develop a conceptualist semantics. Among other major components of functionalism are discoursepragmatic analyses, the study of grammaticalization, and universal-typological investigation via cross-linguistic surveys.4 Naturally, terms like “cognitive linguistics” and “functionalism” are ﬂuid in reference and subsume a diverse array of views. There is at best a broad compatibility of outlook among the scholars concerned, certainly not theoretical uniformity.
A question commonly asked is: “What is cognitive about Cognitive Grammar? Or about cognitive linguistics in general?” These do not merit the label merely by proclaiming that language is part of cognition and that linguistic investigation contributes to understanding the human mind—that much is shared by many approaches, both formal and functional. Then what links to cognition do distinguish cognitive linguistics from either formal linguistics or other strains of functionalism? Within functionalism, cognitive linguistics stands out by emphasizing the semiological function

3 See Langacker 1999c. The difference is not a matter of rigor, precision, degree of formalization, or scientiﬁc merit. Formal and functional approaches both vary widely along these parameters.

PRELIMINARIES

of language. It fully acknowledges the grounding of language in social interaction, but insists that even its interactive function is critically dependent on conceptualization. Compared with formal approaches, cognitive linguistics stands out by resisting the imposition of boundaries between language and other psychological phenomena. Insofar as possible, linguistic structure is seen as drawing on other, more basic systems and abilities (e.g. perception, memory, categorization) from which it cannot be segregated. Rather than constituting a distinct, self-contained entity (a separate “module” or “mental faculty”), language is viewed as an integral facet of cognition.
As for CG in particular, care is taken to invoke only well-established or easily demonstrated mental abilities that are not exclusive to language. We are able, for example, to focus and shift attention, to track a moving object, to form and manipulate images, to compare two experiences, to establish correspondences, to combine simple elements into complex structures, to view a scene from different perspectives, to conceptualize a situation at varying levels of abstraction, and so on. Can general abilities like these fully account for the acquisition and the universal properties of language? Or are speciﬁc blueprints for language wired in and genetically transmitted? CG does not prejudge this issue. We are evidently born to speak, so it is not precluded that language might emerge owing to substantial innate speciﬁcation peculiar to it. But if our genetic endowment does make special provisions for language, they are likely to reside in adaptations of more basic cognitive phenomena, rather than being separate and sui generis. They would be analogous in this respect to the physical organs of speech.
Despite its functional nature, CG shares with formal approaches the commitment to seeking explicit characterizations of language structure.5 For various reasons our capacity to achieve them is subject to strong inherent limitations. Nevertheless, a functional account of language has little chance of proving revealing and empirically adequate unless it is based on reasonably precise and detailed linguistic descriptions. At the same time, I believe that optimal description requires a functional perspective.
The components of a comprehensive functional theory can be conceptualized as a three-level pyramid. The ﬁrst and lowest level speciﬁes the resources available for describing linguistic structures. Ideally, this inventory of descriptive constructs would enable one to properly characterize any structure encountered in any language. Research in CG has aimed primarily at justifying particular constructs by examining diverse phenomena in numerous languages. If the descriptive inventory is adequate for all structures in all languages, it will necessarily deﬁne a very large space of possibilities, many reaches of which are sparsely populated. The second level of the pyramid deals with the “warping” of this space, such that linguistic structures tend to cluster in certain areas while generally avoiding others. A major goal of functional theory is to specify the “attractors” in this space, i.e. the range of structures that are prototypical in language, as well as their degree of prototypicality. Cross-linguistic research on typology and language universals is clearly essential for producing a reliable enumeration. Finally, the third and top level of the pyramid

5 CG is thus considered by some functionalists to be a formal model. Formalists tend not to make that mistake.

consists of functional explanations for empirical ﬁndings at the second level. Proposing such explanations (e.g. by offering discourse motivation for aspects of clause structure) has been a basic occupation of functional investigation.
While each higher level in the pyramid logically presupposes the lower ones, in practice research at the three levels must proceed simultaneously. By emphasizing the foundational level, CG has been more concerned with structural description than with prototypicality and functional explanation. The theoretical proposals and speciﬁc descriptions of CG are, however, envisaged as being embedded in an overall account that encompasses all three levels. Descriptions of particular constructions are not meant to be free-standing, for in themselves they offer no indication of how or to what extent the constructions are functionally motivated. It is only by combining the functional and the descriptive dimensions that we arrive at a full understanding of grammatical phenomena.
Expositions of CG have perhaps not sufﬁciently emphasized its place within an overall functional account. This has no doubt abetted the common misconception that CG is unconstrained and makes no predictions. If anything, just the opposite is true. This may not be evident given the focus on basic descriptive apparatus: a set of constructs sufﬁciently ﬂexible to describe the full range of linguistic structures (even the most atypical ones) is unlikely, in and of itself, to be highly constraining. CG’s restrictiveness has other sources. A primary source is the information provided at higher levels of the pyramid—that is, enumerations of what is prototypical in language, and why. In my view, positive speciﬁcations of this sort offer the proper means of imposing restrictions (since explicit prohibitions are endless and often porous). By stating what does tend to occur in language, we implicitly indicate what tends not to occur. More precisely, by specifying the location and strength of attractors in the space of structural possibilities, we inherently make predictions about the relative likelihood of particular kinds of structures being encountered in a given language, hence about their cross-linguistic prevalence.
It is not true, then, that CG is unconstrained. I likewise reject the related misconception that I and others misled by me are given to positing wild and fanciful things limited only by the scope of our imagination. The theory and the research are actually notable for their down-to-earth nature, and in §1.3.4 I elucidate the severe restrictions imposed on what can be postulated. For some reason CG appears especially prone to being misapprehended. Competent scholars have conﬁdently but gratuitously asserted, for example, that CG cannot handle metaphor (it can), that it does not account for ungrammaticality (it does), that it is solipsistic (it is not), that it portrays language as a static entity (it does not), and that everything is claimed to be iconic (no such claim is made). These points are all covered later. For now let us turn to the most fecund source of misconceptions about CG, namely the notations it employs.

1.2.3 Those Diagrams
On occasion I resort to diagrams. Of course, those occasions are rather frequent, and critics will no doubt aver that I use them excessively. It is certainly true that works in CG (including this one) are often replete with diagrams, ranging from simple,

10

PRELIMINARIES

cartoon-like sketches to elaborate technical displays of great complexity. There is, I suppose, no reason to be apologetic about it. After all, the pages of staid linguistics journals are often splashed with tree-like diagrams drawn by formal syntacticians (not to mention phonologists). The use of diagrams is equally prevalent in the “hard” sciences admired by linguistic theorists. Indeed, we are witnessing the emergence of “scientiﬁc visualization” and the growing recognition of its importance to theory and research. Still, since the diagrams used in CG have so commonly been misconstrued, their nature and status need to be clariﬁed.
Among the misconceptions concerning the diagrams of CG are (i) that they are offered as precise and rigorous formal representations and (ii) that they are merely ad hoc, informal “pictures”. There is actually a germ of truth in both positions. Some diagrams are just picture-like sketches casually devised to help make a point. Others are meticulously assembled from an inventory of speciﬁc notations systematically used with precisely deﬁned values. In all cases, though, I regard the diagrams as being heuristic in nature. While even the most carefully drafted fall considerably short of mathematical rigor, the process of producing them forces the analyst to examine myriad details that are commonly ignored in semantic and grammatical descriptions. In my view they provide a level of precision and explicitness sufﬁcient for most purposes, together with a kind of usability that facilitates discovery.
The notations and representational formats developed in later chapters thus do not amount to a mathematically respectable formalization. Many theorists would consider this unfortunate, taking it for granted both that language is amenable to discrete formalization and that scientiﬁc progress requires it. Reinforcing this prevalent attitude are such powerful icons as formal logic, computer programming, and Chomsky’s archetypal conception of a “generative” grammar (a precise and explicit set of symbol-manipulating rules that enumerate all and only the well-formed sentences of a language). Collectively these engender and sustain certain expectations concerning what linguistic descriptions ought to look like and the level of mathematical rigor to be striven for. I believe, however, that these expectations are inappropriate for natural language, which is not a self-contained or well-deﬁned formal system. I likewise reject the metaphor that likens mind to a digital computer and language to a program that it runs. CG is more at home in the “connectionist” (“neural network”) world of dynamic systems, parallel processing, distributed representations, and computation by simultaneous constraint satisfaction.6
Since language (for reasons developed later) is neither self-contained nor welldeﬁned, a complete formal description (a “generative grammar” in the classical sense) is held to be impossible in principle. The same is true when any particular dimension or facet of linguistic structure is examined individually. Language does not resemble a collection of computer programs. Rather, it inheres in the dynamic processing of real neural networks, and while the patterns that emerge are certainly

6 With the emergence of this psychologically more plausible alternative, algorithmic computation over discrete symbolic representations is becoming progressively less important in linguistics. (In this context, “symbolic” refers to the symbols used in a computation, usually considered contentless. This is quite different from “symbolic” as understood in CG, where a symbolic structure is meaningful by deﬁnition.)

ORIENTATION

amenable to analysis, the discrete notations and static representations devised by linguists can at best only approximate them. But to recognize these limitations is not to see everything as dissolving into a homogeneous mush. CG acknowledges the existence of highly elaborate linguistic structures, as well as the need to describe them as precisely and explicitly as possible—both to understand language in its own terms and to make evident what an adequate model of cognitive processing will have to deal with. If CG diagrams remain heuristic, notations can nonetheless be developed to characterize particular phenomena in as much explicit detail as present knowledge allows. Asking or claiming any more would in my estimation be premature, pointless, and pretentious. Unless and until we have a clear conceptual understanding of what is going on, there is no point in seeking mathematical precision.
The diagrams used for grammatical constructions come closest to being formal representations. When worked out in careful detail, they might be considered “quasiformal”, though I will describe them merely as systematic. Certain limitations have to be noted. The diagrams are necessarily selective; even the more systematic ones abstract away from many features not presently in focus. If drawn with any speciﬁcity, the diagrams representing expressions of even modest size prove quite complex and unwieldy (e.g. ﬁg. 7.13). Moreover, reading such a diagram takes some time and effort, especially when the notational conventions have not yet been fully mastered. I recognize these points but do not accept them as valid criticisms. After all, the same limitations hold for both formulaic representations and the diagrams used in other frameworks.
The diagrams used for grammar seem not to raise many eyebrows (tree-like representations being traditional in that domain). When it comes to semantics, however, misconceptions abound and credulity is ceded more grudgingly. This is not surprising, since meaning is far more complex than grammar, and far more difﬁcult to study and describe. CG attempts at representing it have consequently been sketchier, more informal, more preliminary, and less systematic than in the case of grammar.7 Fair minds will recognize that, in having an account of semantics which is neither exhaustive nor deﬁnitive, CG hardly stands alone. Yet, because it accepts the centrality of meaning and tries to say something both substantive and psychologically plausible about it, the deﬁciencies are especially apparent. Let me then correct a ﬁrst misconception by stating unambiguously that no semantic representation proposed in CG is ever considered exhaustive. For reasons outlined in chapter 2, complete semantic descriptions cannot realistically be envisaged. Any actual description must limit itself to facets of the total meaning that are either central or relevant for a speciﬁc immediate purpose. If they are principled, linguistically revealing, and empirically supported, even partial characterizations are valid and useful.
What should they look like? With syntax and formal logic as their models, linguists are accustomed to describing semantic structure by means of formulaic representations comprising strings of discrete symbols. Hence the use in CG of semipictorial diagrams (and even crude pictures on occasion) does, I think, raise eyebrows. This is not the place to debate the very real issue of whether meaning, as an actual cognitive phenomenon,

7 Because grammar is claimed to be symbolic, there is no sharp distinction between semantic and grammatical diagrams. The latter incorporate representations of meaning.

is better approximated by discrete symbolic representations or by something more analogical in nature. I would only argue that the kinds of diagrams employed in CG are heuristically effective and not inappropriate, given our present level of understanding. One could choose, for example, to represent the concept TRIANGLE in either a propositional or a diagrammatic format, as shown in ﬁgure 1.1. Although I certainly appreciate the virtues of the formulaic description, its imagic counterpart is understandably the one I would work with for most quotidian purposes.
From the frequent use of quasi-pictorial diagrams, some critics of CG have leaped to the incorrect conclusion that semantic structure is claimed to be entirely visual or spatial in nature. A related misconception is that CG can only deal with visuospatial notions. On the contrary, the essential constructs proposed for semantic description (e.g. various kinds of prominence) are applicable to any cognitive domain and independent of any particular mode of presentation. Another misapprehension is that the diagrams have a consistently analog character; yet another is that the schematic images they employ purport to be direct depictions of conceptual structure. The actual intent of these diagrams is rather more modest: to allow certain facets of conceptual organization to be represented in a format that is both user-friendly and explicit enough to serve as a basis for semantic and grammatical analysis.
I believe the diagrams serve this intended heuristic function reasonably well. While less than fully systematic, they can be made quite precise and force a kind of explicitness that facilitates discovery. The diagrams must, however, be used with caution, for they can be misleading as well as informative: like any other notation, they omit as much as they reveal, and they are biasing if not distorting. Constant awareness of their limitations is well advised.
1.2.4 The Spirit of the Enterprise
From a limited exposure to CG, many people receive the impression that it is “easy”, apparently basing their assessment on its intuitive naturalness, its focus on meaning, the liberal use of diagrams, and the seeming absence of constraints. I agree at least in part: it is quite easy to do CG badly, and not so hard to do it indifferently. To do it well is obviously much harder. For various intrinsic reasons, arriving at analyses that will readily be accepted as sound and convincing is arguably more difﬁcult than in other frameworks.
By and large, linguistic theory and training foster a basic expectation of discreteness in language and thus a strong inclination to posit it. This preference is evident

in all domains and in every facet of investigation. Although its liabilities are now widely recognized, the following have all been prevalent features of modern linguistic thought and practice: (1) the virtually exclusive reliance on “digital” representations composed of discrete symbols; (2) the presumed adequacy of simple yes/no judgments of well-formedness; (3) the common neglect of linguistic variation; (4) the sharp distinction drawn between the synchronic study of language structure and the diachronic study of how it changes and evolves; (5) the assumption that language is clearly delimited and self-contained (with respect to other mental faculties, as well as associated phenomena like gesture); (6) the division of language into separate components, such as phonetics, phonology, lexicon, morphology, syntax, semantics, and pragmatics; (7) the focus on regular patterns permitting crisp generalizations (with the attendant difﬁculty in handling irregularity and generalizations of limited scope); (8) the default assumption of classical categories with strict boundaries, as opposed to prototype categories with degrees of membership; (9) the notion that absolute predictability ought to be the norm, so that anything which fails to achieve it is held to be of little interest; (10) the usual practice of formulating questions in terms of mutually exclusive alternatives.8
This world of discrete units and sharp boundaries is deﬁnitely attractive. Dividing makes it easier to conquer. In particular, if meaning can safely be ignored, the description of grammar is greatly simpliﬁed (at least superﬁcially). Discrete structures are more readily analyzed and more amenable to perspicuous formalization. Also, the categorical statements and strong predictability afforded by discreteness are highly valued in science. Yet language was not necessarily designed for the convenience or predilections of the analyst. We must therefore ask whether the basic discreteness commonly assumed by linguistic theorists has been discovered in language or imposed on it. Since my own experience has led me to challenge all of points (1) to (10), I reluctantly conclude that it has largely been imposed.9 This is not to say, however, that everything in language is continuous—far from it—or to deny the utility of discrete representations, provided that we recognize their possible limitations.
To the extent that language deviates from the expectations embodied in points (1) to (10), accurate descriptions are more difﬁcult to achieve and less likely to satisfy orthodox theorists. Consider just one central issue: the putative autonomy of syntax vis-à-vis semantics. If syntax is separate and self-contained, so that meaning can be ignored, describing it becomes much easier in certain respects. It is easier, for example, to claim that the noun category represents an irreducible syntactic primitive, lacking intrinsic semantic content, than to propose a conceptual characterization that is both linguistically revealing and psychologically plausible (see ch. 4). It is easier just to list grammatical markers and state where they occur than to also determine and represent their meanings. An autonomous form of grammatical description

8 I call this the exclusionary fallacy (FCG1: §1.1.6). It is exempliﬁed by the commonly asked question (pointless in CG) of whether something is “in the lexicon” or “in the syntax”.
9 By virtue of training and inclination, I personally favor discreteness, but language has chosen not to cooperate. Points (1) to (10) are all addressed in later discussion.

PRELIMINARIES

is more easily extended to a new language or a new structural domain than is a symbolic account requiring semantic analysis.
Adding to the difﬁculty are the stringent constraints imposed on CG descriptions. A strong limitation on what kinds of elements can be posited is presented in §1.3.4. Further restrictions follow from the requirement of psychological plausibility. CG’s nonmodular view of language—approaching it as an integral facet of cognition dependent on more general systems and abilities—implies an ultimate responsibility to the ﬁndings of other cognitive sciences. An important additional source of control is the nonautonomy of grammar. If grammar is truly independent of meaning, the analyst is free to describe it paying no heed to semantic considerations. By contrast, the symbolic view of grammar obliges the analyst to accommodate both form and meaning. When properly conducted, their investigation is mutually informing and mutually constraining. Grammatical markings and patterns call attention to subtle aspects of meaning and pose descriptive problems requiring semantic solutions. In doing semantic analysis, a linguist can use these as both a stimulus and a check: besides being psychologically plausible and internally well motivated, semantic descriptions must articulate well with grammar. Basic constructs of CG have in fact been developed through such a dialectic, which can be offered as an optimal working method.
This illustrates the ﬁrst of several philosophical principles that have guided work in CG: the principle of integration favors inclusiveness and uniﬁcation. It emphasizes the importance of considering and reconciling information from multiple sources (within a language, across languages, and across disciplines). Moreover, it encourages a uniﬁed treatment of the various dimensions of language structure (which have much in common at an abstract level) and urges that one avoid imposing dichotomous organization where there is actually a gradation. The principle of naturalness maintains that language—when properly analyzed—is by and large reasonable and understandable in view of its semiological and interactive functions, as well as its biological, cognitive, and sociocultural grounding. Cognitive and functional linguists ﬁnd that virtually everything in language is motivated in such terms (even if very little is strictly predictable). A third principle, patience, amounts to the admonition that one should not put the cart before the horse. An example of patience is the withholding of judgment on questions that are probably premature (e.g. the extent to which language is innately speciﬁed). Another is the practice of delaying efforts at formalization until we have a basic conceptual understanding of what is going on. This principle does not imply a reluctance to make strong claims and working hypotheses, however.

1.3 Grammar as Symbolization
Enough preliminaries. It is time to offer an initial sketch of Cognitive Grammar, to be ﬂeshed out in later chapters. The central matters to be addressed are the global organization of a linguistic system and what it means to say that grammar is symbolic in nature.
If it proves empirically adequate, CG represents the kind of theory linguists ought to be seeking. First, it is natural in several respects. Moreover, it offers both

conceptual uniﬁcation and theoretical austerity, properties considered desirable in other sciences. CG is natural by virtue of its psychological plausibility, as well as the central place accorded meaning. It is further natural in that its global organization directly reﬂects the basic semiological function of language—namely, permitting meanings to be symbolized phonologically. To serve this function, a language needs at least three kinds of structures: semantic, phonological, and symbolic. The pivotal and most distinctive claim of CG is that only these are needed. This is one aspect of its theoretical austerity. What makes it possible is the notion that lexicon, morphology, and syntax form a continuum fully reducible to assemblies of symbolic structures. If valid, this notion represents a fundamental conceptual uniﬁcation.

1.3.1 Symbolic Complexity
Semantic structures are conceptualizations exploited for linguistic purposes, notably as the meanings of expressions. Under the rubric phonological structure, I include not only sounds but also gestures and orthographic representations. Their essential feature is that of being overtly manifested, hence able to fulﬁll a symbolizing role.10 Symbolic structures are not distinct from semantic and phonological structures, but rather incorporate them. As shown in ﬁgure 1.2(a), a symbolic structure (å) resides in a link between a semantic structure (S) and a phonological structure (P), such that either is able to evoke the other. I describe a symbolic structure as being bipolar: S is its semantic pole, and P its phonological pole. In formulaic representations, a slash is used to indicate a symbolic relationship. The morpheme cat can thus be given as [[CAT]/[cat]], where [CAT] stands for the complex conceptualization comprising its semantic pole, and the phonological pole is rendered orthographically in lowercase.
A deﬁning property of human language is the formation of complex structures out of simpler ones. In ﬁgure 1.2(b), we see two symbolic structures combining to produce a higher-level symbolic structure, represented by the outer box.11 These

figure 1.2
10 For most linguistic purposes, we are more concerned with the cognitive representation of phonological structures than with their actual physical implementation. It is thus coherent to posit abstract (“schematic”) phonological structures which, per se, cannot be overtly manifested. 11 To simplify these initial diagrams, the semantic and phonological poles of higher-level structures are not separately depicted. Their semantic and phonological values are based on those of the component elements, though they are not strictly reducible to them.

16

PRELIMINARIES

lower-level and higher-level structures constitute a symbolic assembly. Of course, a higher-level symbolic structure is itself capable of entering into a combinatory relationship, producing a more elaborate symbolic assembly, as shown in diagram (c). We can say that a series of structures like (a), (b), and (c) exhibit progressively greater symbolic complexity. Through repeated combination, at successively higher levels of organization, assemblies having any degree of symbolic complexity can be formed. A morpheme is deﬁnable as an expression whose symbolic complexity is zero, i.e. it is not at all analyzable into smaller symbolic components. A morpheme can also be thought of as a degenerate symbolic assembly comprising just a single symbolic relationship, as in (a).
Corresponding to diagrams (a), (b), and (c) would be a series of expressions such as moon, moonless, and moonless night. Using hyphens for combinatory relationships, we can represent these formulaically as in (1):

(1) (a) [[MOON]/[moon]] (b) [[[MOON]/[moon]] - [[LESS]/[less]]] (c) [[[[MOON]/[moon]] - [[LESS]/[less]]] - [[NIGHT]/[night]]]

All of these happen to be ﬁxed, familiar expressions conventionally used in English. Hence they are all lexical items, granted CG’s deﬁnition of lexicon as the set of ﬁxed expressions in a language. This deﬁnition is useful, straightforward, and more or less consonant with an everyday understanding of the term. It is not, however, equivalent to other characterizations proposed by linguists, e.g. lexicon as the set of words in a language. Observe that there are ﬁxed expressions larger than words (like moonless night), and there are possible words—such as dollarless—that are novel rather than familiar and conventionally established. Note further that the CG deﬁnition suggests the absence of any strict boundary between lexicon and nonlexical expressions, since familiarity and conventionality are matters of degree. The dictionary lists ireless, for example, and this word does seem vaguely familiar to me, but for most speakers it is no doubt novel and unfamiliar.
Clearly apparent in lexicon are several very basic phenomena that are quite evident in many other facets of cognition. The central role accorded to them is one aspect of CG’s psychological plausibility. They also illustrate the general notion that language recruits, and thus intrinsically manifests in its own organization, a broad array of independently existing cognitive processes. The phenomena in question are association, automatization, schematization, and categorization.
1. Stated most generally, association is simply the establishing of psychological connections with the potential to inﬂuence subsequent processing. It has numerous manifestations in CG. Here we need only recall the association between a semantic and a phonological structure that deﬁnes a symbolic relationship.
2. Automatization is the process observed in learning to tie a shoe or recite the alphabet: through repetition or rehearsal, a complex structure is thoroughly mastered, to the point that using it is virtually automatic and requires little conscious monitoring. In CG parlance, a structure undergoes progressive entrenchment and eventually becomes established as a unit. Lexical items are expressions that have achieved the

ORIENTATION

17

status of units for representative members of a speech community. When it is relevant to draw the distinction, units are enclosed in boxes or square brackets; nonunits are in closed curves, boxes with rounded corners, or parentheses. Dollarless can thus be given as in (2), since the components dollar and -less have each achieved unit status, whereas the overall expression has not.

(2) ( [[DOLLAR]/[dollar]] - [[LESS]/[less]] )

It is important to realize that unit status does not entail the absence or unimportance of components, merely the routinized nature of their execution (which does however tend to diminish their individual salience).12 Though a unit, moonless night is clearly analyzable into moonless and night, and moonless into moon and -less.
3. By schematization, I mean the process of extracting the commonality inherent in multiple experiences to arrive at a conception representing a higher level of abstraction. Schematization plays a role in the acquisition of lexical units, if only because their conventional forms and meanings are less speciﬁc than the usage events (i.e. the actual pronunciations and contextual understandings) on the basis of which they are learned. For example, the basic sense of ring—roughly ‘circular piece of jewelry worn on the ﬁnger’—is schematic relative to the conception of speciﬁc rings in speciﬁc contexts, which vary in such details as size, material, identity of the wearer, and so on. Schematization can be carried to different degrees, depending on the diversity of the elements it is based on. Since ring is also used for adornments worn in other places than on the ﬁnger, we can posit for it the more schematic value ‘circular adornment worn on the body’, with respect to which ‘circular piece of jewelry worn on the ﬁnger’ constitutes an elaboration or speciﬁc instantiation. Still more abstractly, ring can mean ‘circular object’ (consider the rings in gymnastics) or even just ‘circular entity’ (e.g. the ring of dirt left around a bathtub).
4. Categorization is most broadly describable as the interpretation of experience with respect to previously existing structures. A category is a set of elements judged equivalent for some purpose; for example, the alternate senses of a lexical item constitute a category, equivalent in having the same phonological realization. If structure A belongs to a category, it can be used to categorize another structure, B, which may then become a category member. Categorization is most straightforward when A is schematic for B, so that B elaborates or instantiates A. For this I use a solid arrow: A ® B. The arrow indicates that B is fully compatible with A’s speciﬁcations but is characterized with greater precision and detail. For instance, (3)(a) might represent the categorization responsible for ring being applied to circular arenas, as used in circuses and bullﬁghting.
(3) (a) CIRCULAR ENTITY ® CIRCULAR ARENA
(b) CIRCULAR ARENA ---> RECTANGULAR ARENA

12 Likewise, when reciting the alphabet in automatized fashion we still have to say all the letters.

18

PRELIMINARIES

However, it can also happen that B conﬂicts with A’s speciﬁcations but is nonetheless assimilated to the category on the basis of an association or perceived similarity. A is then a prototype (at least locally), and B an extension from it. For this I use a dashed arrow: A ---> B. A possible example is (3)(b), the extension applying ring to rectangular arenas, as used in boxing.

1.3.2 Lexicon and Grammar
If lexicon resides in assemblies of symbolic structures, can we say the same for grammar? Not according to the current orthodoxy, where grammar is sharply distinguished from lexicon and described using a special set of primitives with no intrinsic meaning. Here I argue that a clear demarcation between lexicon and grammar is far from evident. I also indicate how grammar can be described with symbolic assemblies that vary along the same parameters as those describing lexicon, and within the same ranges of values.
In the standard conception, lexical items are essentially syntactic atoms. They are “inserted” into particular slots at the bottom of syntactic tree structures, as sketched in ﬁgure 1.3(a). The individual lexical items are continuous, self-contained, and nonoverlapping. While they may be complex, their internal structure is morphological rather than syntactic. Healthy, for example, is analyzable into the component morphemes health and -y (or, more tenuously, into heal, -th, and -y). Yet it functions syntactically as a simple adjective analogous to big.
This neat partitioning between lexicon and syntax can only be maintained by imposing artiﬁcial boundaries, however—in particular, by ignoring lexical items larger than words. Consider idioms. As ﬁxed expressions whose meanings are not predictable from their parts, idioms satisfy both the CG deﬁnition of lexicon and a

figure 1.3

ORIENTATION

19

more restrictive one requiring semantic idiosyncrasy. They can nonetheless be of any size and exhibit internal structure that is clearly syntactic. For instance, tall tale represents an adjective + noun combination, bury the hatchet consists of a verb and its noun phrase object, while A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush is a full sentence. Rather than being syntactic atoms conﬁned to particular slots in syntactic tree structures, idiomatic expressions subsume various portions of such trees, as is shown abstractly in ﬁgure 1.3(b) by the different-size boxes. The diagram also indicates that idioms can be manifested discontinuously (note the box enclosing [b] and [d]). A stock example is keep tabs on:

(4) (a) The police kept tabs on all the leading activists. (b) Tabs were kept by the police on all the leading activists.

The point is still more evident if we discard the requirement of semantic irregularity (which, in any case, is a matter of degree) and simply deﬁne lexicon as the set of ﬁxed expressions in a language. Becoming a ﬂuent speaker involves learning an enormous inventory of expressions larger than words, representing usual ways of conveying certain notions. These conventional expressions can be of any size and undeniably subsume varying portions of syntactic tree structures, in the manner of ﬁgure 1.3(b). Numerous examples can be found in any text. Conventional among linguists, for instance, are the following expressions, all culled from the previous paragraph: neat partitioning, lexicon and syntax, artiﬁcial boundaries, impose artiﬁcial boundaries, in particular, larger than, satisfy . . . deﬁnition, more restrictive, any size, of any size, internal structure, tree structures, syntactic tree structures, idiomatic expressions, various portions of, stock example, a stock example. According to standard linguistic doctrine, many of these are excluded from the linguistic system on grounds of being semantically and grammatically regular (hence derivable by rules). Their exclusion is arbitrary, however, if a language is characterized as the set of internalized structures (conventional units) that enable its users to speak and understand. Without a substantial inventory of prefabricated expressions, ﬂuent real-time speech would hardly be possible. Theorists have grossly exaggerated the novelty of “novel sentences”.
We have seen that lexical units can be ordered in terms of their degree of symbolic complexity (e.g. moon < moonless < moonless night < a moonless night < on a moonless night). A second parameter along which they vary is schematicity, or its converse speciﬁcity, pertaining to the precision and detail of their characterization. From taxonomic hierarchies like those in (5), it is evident that lexical items run the full gamut semantically from highly schematic, coarse-grained descriptions to those of a speciﬁc, ﬁne-grained nature:
(5) (a) thing ® creature ® animal ® dog ® poodle
(b) do ® act ® propel ® throw ® ﬂing
It is less commonly appreciated that their phonological characterizations also vary along this parameter. For example, the English past-tense morpheme has the regular

20

PRELIMINARIES

allomorphs [d], [t], and [Əd] (as in failed, rocked, and heeded ). Since the choice is phonologically predictable, linguists often posit a schematic representation that speciﬁes only the presence of an alveolar stop (leaving voicing and the possible occurrence of [Ə] to be ﬁlled in by rules). Many languages have morphemes manifested phonologically by reduplication. Thus a plural morpheme might have the schematic form CV-, i.e. a preﬁx consisting of a consonant plus a vowel, whose speciﬁc instantiations match the initial CV of the stem. In the Semitic languages, roots are traditionally described as comprising just a sequence of consonants (typically three), although in any actual form these occur with vowels contributing other lexical and grammatical information. In CG terms, the roots are phonologically schematic in regard to the placement and identity of the supporting vowels.
Many multiword lexical units contain schematic elements. A well-known example is X crane X+POSS neck, where X refers schematically to the agent and neck possessor. It represents the commonality inherent in an open-ended set of expressions in which X is instantiated by a speciﬁc nominal element: I craned my neck, She was craning her neck, Phil always cranes his neck, and so on. Another partially schematic unit is Vs X in the Nb, where Vs is a verb of striking like hit, kick, strike, or poke and Nb is a body-part noun like shin, back, face, eye, or knee. Certain partial instantiations of this schema are themselves established units (“collocations”), e.g. hit X in the back, kick X in the shin, poke X in the eye. Even more schematic is the template a N1 + less N2, instantiated by speciﬁc unit expressions such as a moonless night, a childless couple, a hopeless situation, a treeless plain, a fruitless search, a cordless phone, and so on.
It should be apparent that this list of partially schematic unit expressions could be extended indeﬁnitely. They constitute an essential—perhaps even the preponderant— component of a ﬂuent speaker’s conventional linguistic knowledge. Yet standard linguistic theory hardly recognizes their existence, let alone accommodate them in any straightforward manner. The problem is that they conform to the stereotype of neither lexicon nor grammar, and by combining features of each, they subvert the claim that these are sharply distinct. Units like X crane X+POSS neck, Vs X in the Nb, and a N1+less N2 are nonstereotypical for grammar by virtue of containing speciﬁc lexical elements. They are nonstereotypical for lexicon because of their partial schematicity. They are not themselves full-ﬂedged expressions but patterns abstracted from them and potentially used in forming new ones. To this extent they are grammar-like, since grammar by deﬁnition comprises the patterns used in forming complex expressions. In an effort to preserve the standard dichotomy, X crane X+POSS neck could be assigned to the lexicon, as it contains the indisputably “lexical” elements crane and neck, whereas a N1 + less N2 might be considered grammatical because its only speciﬁc components (a and -less) are “grammatical markers”. This will not solve the problem, however. Apart from being aprioristic, it leaves us with an arbitrary choice in cases like Vs X in the Nb, where Vs and Nb are intermediate in speciﬁcity (Vs designating a certain type of action, and Nb a body part). What the linguistic data seems to be trying to tell us is that lexicon and grammar form a gradation instead of being sharply dichotomous. That, of course, is a central claim of CG, which further contends that the full gradation reduces to assemblies of symbolic structures.

1.3.3 Grammar as Symbolic Assemblies
We have seen that symbolic assemblies range widely along three main parameters. First, they vary in symbolic complexity, as sketched in ﬁgure 1.2 and exempliﬁed by a series of lexical units like sharp < sharpen < sharpener < pencil sharpener < electric pencil sharpener. Second, they vary in their degree of speciﬁcity (or conversely, schematicity), as seen in (5), and also in a series like (6), where the initial structure is wholly schematic, the next partially instantiated, and the last fully speciﬁc:
(6) Vs X in the Nb ® kick X in the shin ® kick my pet giraffe in the shin
Third, symbolic assemblies vary in the extent to which they achieve the status of units and become conventional within a speech community.13 The ﬁrst two structures in (6) are plausibly ascribed the status of conventional units in English, whereas the last one— taken as a whole—is surely novel. The different facets of lexicon and grammar can all be characterized as symbolic assemblies occupying various regions in the abstract space deﬁned by these three parameters. Bear in mind, though, that we are dealing with graded phenomena. The regions corresponding to particular traditional notions are expected to overlap, and speciﬁc lines of demarcation are held to be arbitrary.
Full-ﬂedged expressions—those we could actually use—are speciﬁc at the phonological pole, for they have to be capable of being spoken, signed, or written down.14 At the semantic pole there is more ﬂexibility, though actual expressions tend to be rather speciﬁc. Since expressions can obviously be of any size, they range freely along the dimension of symbolic complexity. They can also have any degree of conventionality. To the extent that expressions become entrenched and attain the

figure 1.4
13 For ease of discussion, I am conﬂating two parameters that eventually have to be distinguished: entrenchment or unit status (pertaining to a particular speaker) and conventionality (pertaining to a speech community). 14 This is basically what the term expression is meant to convey. The notion involves many subtleties, but they will not concern us (FCG1: §11.2.1).

PRELIMINARIES

status of conventional units, they constitute lexical items. To the extent that they do not, they are novel. This is sketched in ﬁgure 1.4(a), where the dashed line indicates the absence of any sharp boundary.
The lexicon and grammar of a language consist of symbolic assemblies that in substantial measure have achieved the status of conventional units. Figure 1.4(b) shows their arrangement with respect to the parameters of schematicity and symbolic complexity. The elements traditionally recognized as (prototypical) lexical items are phonologically and semantically speciﬁc expressions with only limited symbolic complexity: dog, moonless, carefully, toothbrush. I suggest, however, that drawing any particular line of demarcation along either parameter would be arbitrary. A broader array of structures are therefore accepted in CG as lexical items, including symbolic units that are schematic either phonologically (like Semitic roots) or semantically (e.g. do, a, -less), as well as assemblies of indeﬁnite symbolic complexity (such as idioms and proverbs). Also subsumed under lexicon are symbolically complex assemblies that are both semantically and phonologically schematic in certain positions, like X crane X+POSS neck or X take Y over X+POSS knee and spank Y.
Where does lexicon stop and grammar begin? The point, of course, is that there is no particular place. But this is not to say that no distinction can be drawn. The key parameter is speciﬁcity. To the extent that symbolic assemblies are speciﬁc, they would tend to be regarded as lexical, both traditionally and in CG. To the extent that they are schematic, they would generally be considered grammatical. Thus lexicon can be characterized as residing in fairly speciﬁc symbolic assemblies, and grammar in more schematic ones. Toward the two extremes are clear cases unequivocably identiﬁable as lexical or grammatical (e.g. dog vs. a pattern for forming relative clauses). In between lie many structures (such as Vs X in the Nb) validly thought of either way, depending on one’s purpose.
The claim, then, is that grammar reduces to schematic symbolic assemblies. But what exactly does this mean? How does symbolic grammar work? Later sections and chapters answer these questions in some detail. For now, let us focus on three basic matters: grammatical markers, grammatical classes, and grammatical rules. These are all describable by means of symbolic assemblies. What distinguishes them are the regions they occupy in the abstract space deﬁned by the parameters of schematicity and symbolic complexity.
1. As parts of expressions, grammatical markers are speciﬁc at the phonological pole, since they have to be capable of overt realization.15 Even those reasonably ascribed a schematic phonological value, like a reduplicative morpheme or the regular English past tense, acquire speciﬁc segmental content in a given expression. On the other hand, grammatical markers tend to be quite schematic at the semantic pole—otherwise they would simply be lexical items. There is little agreement among linguists concerning which elements to identify as “grammatical” rather than “lexical”. Examples commonly treated both ways include prepositions (e.g. for, to, at, like), modals (may, can, will, shall, must), and indeﬁnite pronouns (someone, anywhere, everybody, whatever, who). These all resemble canonical lexical items

15 Alternate terms for grammatical markers include “grammatical morpheme”, “function word”, “empty word”, “formative”, and “closed-class element”.

23

in having clearly discernible meanings. At the same time, their meanings resemble those of classic grammatical markers in being tenuous, abstract, and hard to elucidate. From the standpoint of CG, which posits a gradation, such uncertainty is unproblematic; because schematicity is a matter of degree, it is actually expected that certain elements should be ambivalent as to their lexical or grammatical status. The essential point, though, is that even the most “grammatical” of grammatical markers—forms like be, do, of, the inﬁnitival to, agreement markers, case inﬂections, and derivational afﬁxes—are viewed in CG as being meaningful.
2. Grammatical markers are closely related to grammatical classes, which they often serve to derive or signal. A class per se, however, is not overtly manifested but resides in a set of symbolic structures that function alike in certain respects. CG maintains that grammatical classes are deﬁnable in symbolic terms and, more controversially, that basic classes like noun, verb, adjective, and adverb can be given uniform semantic characterizations (see ch. 4). Hence the members of a class all instantiate a schematic description representing their abstract commonality. For instance, the bipolar schema deﬁning the noun class can be written as [[THING]/[ . . . ]], where [THING] speciﬁes that a noun refers to a thing (in the most general sense of that term), and [ . . . ] indicates that no particular phonological properties are speciﬁed. What it means for an expression to be a noun is that it instantiates this schema:

(7) (a) [[THING]/[ . . . ]] ® [[MOON]/[moon]] (b) [[THING]/[ . . . ]] ® [[[TOOTH]/[tooth]] - [[BRUSH]/[brush]]] (c) [[THING]/[ . . . ]] ® [[[[MOON]/[moon]] - [[LESS]/[less]]] - [[NIGHT]/[night]]]

Moon, toothbrush, and moonless night are all nouns because each is a symbolic structure that designates a thing.16 Most nouns elaborate the schema both semantically and phonologically. Arguably, though, the grammatical element thing—the one appearing in forms like something, nothing, and anything—is more speciﬁc only at the phonological pole: [[THING]/[thing]]. Thus, in accordance with ﬁgure 1.4(b), the noun class description is schematic at both poles, the grammatical formative thing is schematic semantically but phonologically speciﬁc, and a typical lexical item like moon is also semantically speciﬁc.
3. Grammatical rules occupy the remaining portion of the abstract space depicted in ﬁgure 1.4(b). By rule I simply mean the characterization of some pattern.17 In CG, rules take the form of schemas: they are abstract templates obtained by reinforcing the commonality inherent in a set of instances. Since grammatical rules are patterns in the formation of symbolically complex expressions, they are themselves symbolically complex as well as schematic. Complex expressions consist of speciﬁc

16 This semantically based characterization is not limited to traditionally recognized lexical items, or even to ﬁxed expressions. In this broad sense, even a full noun phrase (ﬁxed or novel) is classed as a special kind of noun.
17 The term “rule” is often used more narrowly, e.g. for “constructive” statements (like the rewriting rules of generative grammar) as opposed to templates.

symbolic assemblies, and the rules describing them are schematic assemblies that embody their common features.
Schematization can be carried to any degree. If particular expressions give rise to low-level schemas like hit X in the back, kick X in the shin, and poke X in the eye, these in turn support the extraction of the higher-level schema Vs X in the Nb. This may then instantiate a still more abstract schema based on a wider array of data. For instance, Vc X P the Nb (where Vc is a verb of contact) would also subsume such patterns as kiss X on the cheek, grasp X by the wrist, chuck X under the chin, and grab X around the waist. These examples further show that the different components of a complex symbolic assembly can be schematic to varying degrees.
The schematic assemblies describing grammatical patterns can also exhibit any degree of symbolic complexity. Simpler schemas are often incorporated as components of more complex ones. For instance, adjectives like moonless, childless, hopeless, treeless, fruitless, and cordless instantiate a derivational pattern that we can write as N+less.18 This schematic symbolic assembly is one component of N1+less N2 (as in moonless night, childless couple, hopeless situation, treeless plain, fruitless search, cordless phone), which in turn is part of a N1+less N2.
A speaker’s knowledge of grammatical patterns resides in a vast inventory of symbolic assemblies ranging widely along the parameters of schematicity and symbolic complexity. It is a highly structured inventory, in that the assemblies bear a variety of relations to one another, such as instantiation, overlap, and inclusion. These schemas are abstracted from occurring expressions, and once established as units they can serve as templates guiding the formation of new expressions on the same pattern. For example, once abstracted to represent the commonality of ﬁxed expressions like moonless night, childless couple, hopeless situation, etc., the schematic assembly N1+less N2 is subsequently available to sanction the occurrence of novel expressions like moonless world, dollarless surgeon, and ireless dwarf.19 All of this holds for both morphological and syntactic patterns. If we wish to make a distinction, we can do no better than follow the tradition of drawing the line at the level of the word. Morphology is then described by schematic assemblies (like N+less) whose instantiations are no larger than words, and syntax by assemblies (like N1+less N2) with multiword instantiations. Even so the boundary is fuzzy, if only due to expressions (such as compounds) that are intermediate between single words and multiword sequences.

1.3.4 The Content Requirement
Compared with the descriptive machinery routinely invoked in other frameworks, CG is quite conservative and highly restrictive in what it allows the analyst to posit. Any ﬂights of fancy cognitive grammarians might be prone to are seriously

18 Formulaic representations like N+less, N1+less N2, and Vs X in the Nb are merely abbreviatory. Actual CG descriptions of such assemblies have to specify in some detail both the internal structure of the symbolic elements and the relations they bear to one another.
19 The extraction of a schema need not require ﬁxed expressions. Schematization is just the reinforcing of recurring commonalities, which can perfectly well inhere in novel expressions, none of which ever coalesces as a unit.

ORIENTATION

25

constrained by the content requirement. Adopted as a strong working hypothesis, this requirement states that the only elements ascribable to a linguistic system are (i) semantic, phonological, and symbolic structures that actually occur as parts of expressions; (ii) schematizations of permitted structures; and (iii) categorizing relationships between permitted structures. The thrust of the content requirement is that the linguistic knowledge we ascribe to speakers should be limited to elements of form and meaning found in actually occurring expressions, or which derive from such elements via the basic psychological phenomena listed in §1.3.1: association, automatization, schematization, and categorization. By keeping our feet on the ground, this restriction assures both naturalness and theoretical austerity.
Provision (i) of the content requirement imposes the symbolic view of grammar and grounds linguistic descriptions in the sounds and meanings that occur in actual usage. These are directly apprehended, in the sense that we hear or produce the sounds of a usage event and understand it in a certain way. They also have intrinsic content related to broader realms of experience—the sounds of speech represent a particular class of auditory phenomena, and linguistic meanings are special cases of conceptualization. By contrast, grammar is not per se something that untrained speakers are aware of. It is not directly apprehended in the same way that sounds and meanings are, nor does it manifest any broader experiential realm. Having no independently discernible content, grammar is reasonably seen as residing in the abstracted commonality of sound-meaning pairings—that is, as being symbolic in nature.
Let us see how the content requirement applies, starting with phonological structures. Provision (i) allows us to posit speciﬁc elements such as segments, syllables, and any larger sequences sufﬁciently frequent to become entrenched as units. As speakers of English, for example, we master particular sound segments ([a], [t], [m], [s], etc.) and a substantial number of recurring syllables (e.g. [hap], [liv], [mek]).20 Provision (ii) permits schematized segments and syllables. At different levels of abstraction, for instance, schemas can be posited representing what is common to the high front vowels of a language, the front vowels, or the vowels in general. Each schema characterizes a natural class of segments. Similarly, the schematic template [CVC] embodies the abstract commonality of [hap], [liv], [mek], and many other syllables. Provision (iii) lets us posit categorizing relationships, such as those between schemas and their instantiations. Thus [[CVC] ® [hap]] indicates that [hap] is categorized as an instance of the [CVC] syllable type.
Analogously, the content requirement allows the postulation of speciﬁc and schematic semantic structures, as well as relationships of semantic categorization. Conceptual units are most clearly linguistically relevant—and thus qualify as semantic units—by virtue of being individually symbolized.21 Permitted under provision (i) of the content requirement are conceptions functioning as the conventional meanings of

20 Considering them as purely phonological units, it is irrelevant whether these segments and syllables can function as morphemes. Prosodic elements naturally have to be posited as well.
21 Semantic units need not be individually symbolized (any more than phonological units need be individually meaningful). For instance, there is no everyday term for the maximal extension of a category, i.e. the union of all instances. Yet this notion is one conceptual component of all, most, and some, which refer to various proportions of the full extension.

PRELIMINARIES

lexical items. Given an array of similar semantic units, such as [ROSE], [DAISY], and [TULIP], provision (ii) sanctions a more schematic structure representing their abstract commonality, in this case [FLOWER]. While [FLOWER] is itself a lexical meaning, hence directly available under (i), we can readily imagine schemas that are not. It is plausible, for example, that from notions like [HORSE], [DONKEY], and [ZEBRA] many speakers extract a schematic conception, [HORSE-LIKE CREATURE], that they have no lexical means of expressing (equine being a learnèd form). In either circumstance, relationships of semantic categorization are ascribable to the linguistic system in accordance with provision (iii): [[FLOWER] ® [TULIP]], [[HORSE-LIKE CREATURE] ® [DONKEY]]. Also permitted are relationships of semantic extension, such as [[HORSE] ---> [DONKEY]], where a donkey is categorized as an atypical kind of horse.
Examples of symbolic units allowed by clause (i) of the content requirement are speciﬁc nouns like [[MOON]/[moon]], [[TULIP]/tulip]], and [[HOPE]/[hope]]. Clause (ii) permits the class schema [[THING]/[ . . . ]], describing what nouns have in common, and (iii) lets us classify particular elements as nouns, e.g. [[[THING]/[ . . . ]] ® [[MOON]/[moon]]]. We must also consider symbolically complex expressions, for instance moonless, cordless, and toothless. These are permitted by clause (i), the N+less pattern by (ii), and their categorization as instances of the pattern by (iii). For moonless, we see this formulaically in (8)(a)–(c), respectively:

(8) (a) [[[MOON]/[moon]] - [[LESS]/[less]]] (b) [[[THING/[ . . . ]] - [[LESS]/[less]]] (c) [[[[THING/[ . . . ]] - [[LESS]/[less]]] ® [[[MOON]/[moon]] - [[LESS]/[less]]]]

It is claimed that grammar resides in vast networks of symbolic assemblies such as these, with varying degrees of abstraction and symbolic complexity.
The content requirement keeps the analyst from resorting to several kinds of devices commonly used in formalist theories. Since patterns can only arise by the schematization of occurring expressions, this requirement rules out derivations from underlying structures with divergent properties.22 Also ruled out are formless, meaningless elements (e.g. “traces”) posited solely to drive the machinery of autonomous syntax. Last but not least, the content requirement proscribes the use of “ﬁlters”, rules speciﬁcally stating what cannot occur in well-formed expressions. CG assumes that languages are learned and that they are learned primarily by reinforcement of the commonality inherent in what actually does occur. I cannot yet claim to have demonstrated that negative statements are avoidable altogether, that descriptions using only positive speciﬁcations prove optimal for all linguistic structures and strictures. This is nonetheless quite natural and desirable as a working hypothesis, if only because it offers the most straightforward account of language learning.

22 Provision (iii) is intended to permit extensions (and chains of extensions) from a prototype, however. (For discussion of the difference, see FCG1: §11.3.3.)

2
Conceptual Semantics
In a rare instance of consensus, linguists agree that grammar is extremely complex
and hard to properly describe. Why should it be so difﬁcult? The reason, I suggest, is precisely the fact that grammar is meaningful. Rather than being autonomous, it resides in schematized patterns of conceptual structuring and symbolization. For this reason we need a conceptual semantics. We cannot describe grammar revealingly without a principled and reasonably explicit characterization of the conceptual structures it incorporates.
2.1 Meaning and Semantic Representations How we think about grammar depends on our view of linguistic meaning. Unfortunately, there is no general agreement on this score. Even the most basic issues—for example, the role of cognition in semantics—are points of chronic and continued contention. Let me then outline the rationale for certain positions adopted in CG.
2.1.1 Are Meanings in the Head? Our concern is with the meanings of linguistic expressions. Where are these meanings to be found? From a cognitive linguistic perspective, the answer is evident: meanings are in the minds of the speakers who produce and understand the expressions. It is hard to imagine where else they might be. Yet there are many scholars who resist or reject that answer.1 A conceptualist view of meaning is not as self-evident as it might ﬁrst seem and has to be properly interpreted.
What are the alternatives? The ﬁrst two options, in their extreme form, leave the human mind and body out of the picture altogether. The platonic view treats
1 In fact, semantics textbooks often speciﬁcally argue against the identiﬁcation of meanings with concepts (e.g. Palmer 1981: 24–29).
27

28

PRELIMINARIES

language as an abstract, disembodied entity that cannot be localized. Like the objects and laws of mathematics (e.g. the geometric ideal of a circle), linguistic meanings are seen as transcendent, existing independently of minds and human endeavor. More traditional is the objectivist position—still prevalent in philosophy, logic, and formal semantics—identifying the meaning of a sentence with the set of conditions under which it is true. These “truth conditions” pertain to what the world is like objectively, irrespective of how it might be conceptualized. Both options stand in sharp contrast to the cognitive semantic view that meaning derives from embodied human experience. This book should amply demonstrate the critical role of mental processes in semantics and grammar.
More reasonable is the interactive alternative, which does take people into account but claims that an individual mind is not the right place to look for meanings. Instead, meanings are seen as emerging dynamically in discourse and social interaction. Rather than being ﬁxed and predetermined, they are actively negotiated by interlocutors on the basis of the physical, linguistic, social, and cultural context. Meaning is not localized but distributed, aspects of it inhering in the speech community, in the pragmatic circumstances of the speech event, and in the surrounding world. In particular, it is not inside a single speaker’s head. The static, insular view ascribed to cognitive semantics is deemed incapable of handling the dynamic, intersubjective, context-dependent nature of meaning construction in actual discourse.
In and of itself, the interactive alternative is certainly correct. It is not however an alternative—its essential ideas are in fact accepted as basic tenets of cognitive semantics. Though common, the portrayal of cognitive semantics as being static and insular is simply wrong. Conversely, a revealing account of communicative interaction needs to acknowledge and characterize the conceptualizations employed in discourse. The cognitive and interactive approaches are therefore quite compatible, provided that the former is correctly portrayed and the latter adequately formulated. It is only with an extremist formulation of interactionism—one which denies cognition a central role—that any conﬂict arises.
The CG position on these issues accommodates both the cognitive and the interactive perspectives. We can best appreciate it by contrasting it with certain extreme positions standing in polar opposition to one another. Consider the opposing positions that everything of consequence is inside the head, and that nothing of consequence is inside the head. According to the former (a kind of solipsism), cognition takes place within a hermetically sealed skull affording no input from or access to the exterior; it is thus asocial and acontextual, contemplation being limited to what goes on inside. According to the latter, meaning is created through communicative interaction between people whose heads—for all intents and purposes—are totally empty. To state these positions explicitly is to see how silly they are. Even so, cognitive linguists are not infrequently charged with solipsism, and interactionist rhetoric sometimes gives the impression that anything inside the head is irrelevant.
The cognition envisaged by cognitive linguists is noninsular, being grounded in perception and bodily experience. Since mental development is stimulated and guided by social interaction, the skills and knowledge acquired are very much attuned to the sociocultural surroundings. The conceptualizations we entertain are undeniably internal, in the sense of taking place in the brain, yet reach beyond it in the sense of

CONCEPTUAL SEMANTICS

being conceptualizations of some facet of the world.2 In speaking, we conceptualize not only what we are talking about but also the context in all its dimensions, including our assessment of the knowledge and intentions of our interlocutor. Rather than being insular, therefore, conceptualization should be seen as a primary means of engaging the world. And empty heads cannot talk, interact, or negotiate meanings.
Closely related is the issue of localization. Can meanings be localized, contained in the minds of individual speakers, or are they distributed over a speech community, the immediate context of speech, as well as the physical and sociocultural world? I take it as evident that the extreme version of distributionism, where nothing at all is ascribed to individual minds, is simply untenable. Its polar opposite—the extreme version of localism, putting everything of relevance inside a single mind—is likewise untenable. But provided that some subtle but crucial distinctions are made, I ﬁnd it reasonable to say that a single speaker grasps an expression’s meaning.
We must ﬁrst distinguish between, on the one hand, the various circumstances that create the potential for meaningful interaction and, on the other hand, the actual mental experience of an individual engaging in such an interaction. Countless aspects of our surroundings do carry meaning potential: the fact of facing a particular interlocutor in a particular social situation, an artifact clearly designed for a certain function, an action conforming to a familiar cultural practice, and so on. Thus, if a doctor extends a tongue depressor toward my mouth and says Open wide, my understanding of what the doctor intends and what I am supposed to do is far more comprehensive than anything derivable from the linguistic expression alone. (I know, for example, that I will not satisfy the request by approaching a cabinet and pulling a drawer out all the way.) It would not be unreasonable to describe the relevant circumstances as being “imbued with meaning” or as “part of the meaning” an expression has in context. Yet I think we gain in clarity and analytical precision by reserving the term “meaning” for how a speaker understands an expression (in either a speaking or a listening capacity). It thus incorporates a speaker’s apprehension of the circumstances, and exploits the meaning potential they carry, but cannot be identiﬁed with those circumstances. So deﬁned, an expression’s meaning resides in the conceptualizing activity of individual speakers.
But does a single individual really ever know an expression’s meaning? One objection is that linguistic meanings are conventional and thus reside at the social rather than the individual level. Another is that many expressions have meanings that are only partially known by any particular speaker. The term electron, for instance, is understood very differently by a theoretical physicist, by an electrical engineer, and by someone like myself with only a vague, partial, and metaphorical idea of its import. It is thus concluded that meanings are distributed over the entire speech community and cannot be found in any single person’s head.
While these observations are true enough, the conclusion depends on the simplistic assumption that just one kind of entity counts as “the meaning” of an expression.

2 Of course, the “world” includes both the real world and the mental worlds we construct, as well as the body and even our mental experience itself (to the extent that we can reﬂect on it, as opposed to merely undergoing it).

30

PRELIMINARIES

We can validly distinguish, however, between what a single speaker knows and the collective knowledge of a whole society. The former is arguably more basic, since collective knowledge consists in (or at least derives from) the knowledge of individuals.3 For purposes of studying language as part of cognition, an expression’s meaning is ﬁrst and foremost its meaning for a single (representative) speaker. This is not to deny or diminish the social aspect of linguistic meaning. An individual’s notion of what an expression means develops through communicative interaction and includes an assessment of its degree of conventionality in the speech community. By their nature, moreover, certain questions have to be studied at the population level (e.g. how norms are established and maintained, the extent to which consensus is achieved, and the range of variation actually encountered). Still, these questions cannot be fully answered unless the knowledge of individual speakers is taken into account.
Lastly, consider the accusation that cognitive semantics—owing to the ﬁxed, static nature of concepts—cannot accommodate the dynamicity of actual language use: rather than being ﬁxed, the values of linguistic elements are actively negotiated; and rather than being static, the meanings of complex expressions emerge and develop in discourse. Though frequently made, this accusation is groundless. In the ﬁrst place, meaning is not identiﬁed with concepts but with conceptualization, the term being chosen precisely to highlight its dynamic nature. Conceptualization is broadly deﬁned to encompass any facet of mental experience. It is understood as subsuming (1) both novel and established conceptions; (1) not just “intellectual” notions, but sensory, motor, and emotive experience as well; (3) apprehension of the physical, linguistic, social, and cultural context; and (4) conceptions that develop and unfold through processing time (rather than being simultaneously manifested). So even if “concepts” are taken as being static, conceptualization is not.
The remaining issue is whether linguistic meanings are ﬁxed and predetermined or whether they are actively negotiated by interlocutors. It ought to be evident that the latter is quite compatible with a conceptualist semantics—Why would anyone assume that conceptualization has to be rigid and inﬂexible? Once more we can usefully consider two extreme positions, neither of which is tenable. At one extreme is the notion that there is no ﬂexibility whatever: a lexical item has a ﬁxed, invariant meaning, and the meaning of a sentence is completely predicted by rules of semantic composition. Cognitive semantics explicitly rejects this option. At the opposite extreme is the view that nothing at all is conventionally established: an element’s meaning is negotiated from scratch every time it is used, with no prior expectation whatever about its possible value. I doubt that anyone actually believes this (though interactionist rhetoric sometimes suggests it). Clearly, there must be something inside the head. Speakers must have some preconception of what the words they use are normally expected to mean. Otherwise the meanings negotiated would be completely random, and cat would have no greater likelihood of meaning ‘feline’ than ‘walnut’, ‘book’, or ‘through’. While everything may be negotiable, something has to be learned and conventionalized as a basis for negotiation.

3 Societal knowledge is also stored in books, databases, the design of artifacts, and so on, but ultimately these reduce to the activity of individual minds in creating or using them.

CONCEPTUAL SEMANTICS

31

2.1.2 What Are Meanings Made Of?
Admitting that meaning resides in conceptualization does not itself solve anything but merely lets us formulate the problem. What do we actually mean by “conceptualization”? What are its general nature and speciﬁc properties? How do we go about investigating it? How can we describe it? At present there are no deﬁnitive answers to such questions. Considerable progress is, however, being made in cognitive linguistics, in the broader context of cognitive science. I would argue that CG embodies a coherent and plausible view of conceptualization, allowing a principled basis for characterizing many facets of semantic and grammatical structure.
Ultimately, conceptualization resides in cognitive processing. Having a certain mental experience resides in the occurrence of a certain kind of neurological activity. Conceptualization can thus be approached from either a phenomenological or a processing standpoint: we can attempt to characterize either our mental experience per se or the processing activity that constitutes it. Cognitive semantics has focused on the former, which is obviously more accessible and amenable to investigation via linguistic evidence. As for processing, it can be studied at different levels (both functional and neurological) and by such varied means as psycholinguistic experiment, clinical research (notably on aphasia), neurological imaging, and now even computer modeling (Holmqvist 1993; Regier 1996; Lakoff and Johnson 1999: appendix). Still, these approaches rely on phenomenological characterizations for guidance and as the basis for interpreting results. And despite the rapid progress being made, a secure and detailed understanding of how speciﬁc linguistic structures are neurologically implemented remains a long-term goal.
Yet even at this early stage, speculative but plausible connections can be posited between the phenomenological and processing levels. What we experience as the prominence of conceived entities is reasonably ascribed to a high level of neural activation.4 The spreading of activation is the evident basis for association and can thus be implicated in many linguistic phenomena (Deane 1992). I further suggest that any conceptual ordering or sequenced mental access implies a corresponding seriality in the processing that constitutes it. In mentally reciting the alphabet, for instance, we run through the letters in sequence, each prompting the next. It seems evident that this ordered conception resides in the ordered occurrence of the neural operations representing each letter, and that our knowledge of the proper sequencing resides in processing routines where the operations representing one letter precede and activate those representing its successor.
As neurological activity, conceptualization has a temporal dimension. Even the simplest conception requires some span of time for its occurrence, and with a more elaborate conception its temporal progression is subject to awareness. The meaning of a complex sentence (like this one) can hardly be apprehended instantaneously; more likely it unfolds on a clause-by-clause basis, there being no instant when all facets of it are simultaneously active and accessible. Conceptualization is dynamic

4 Chafe characterizes discourse status in terms of activation levels: for “given”, “accessible”, and “new” information, he posits the respective levels “active”, “semiactive”, and “inactive” (1994: ch. 6).

32

PRELIMINARIES

in the sense that it unfolds through processing time, and also because the speciﬁc course of development is a signiﬁcant aspect of our mental experience. Thus a pair of sentences like (1)(a)–(b) are not semantically equivalent, despite using the same words to characterize the same objective situation:

(1) (a) A line of trees extends from the highway to the river. (b) A line of trees extends from the river to the highway.

Although the situation described is static, the sentences evoke dynamic conceptualizations in which we mentally scan along the line of trees in one direction or the other. These opposing ways of building up to the full conception, through processing time, result in subtly different mental experiences and different linguistic meanings.
Dynamicity bears on the fundamental issue of whether conceptual structure is basically propositional in nature or whether it has an imagistic character. What kind of format should we ascribe to thoughts and concepts, especially at lower levels of organization? Should they be formulaic in nature, comprising strings of discrete symbols? Or should they be more analogical, more directly depictive of the structure represented?5 The propositional view, still prevalent if not predominant, treats concepts as expressions formulated in a “language of thought” (Fodor 1979), consisting of conceptual “primitives” (the “vocabulary”) and principles for their combination (the “syntax”). The meaning of enter, for example, might be mentally represented by something comparable to the following formula (Jackendoff 1983):

(2) [Event GO ([Thing X], [Path TO ([Place IN ([Thing Y])])])]
Cognitive linguists incline more to imagistic accounts. The best-known proposal posits a set of image schemas, described as schematized patterns of activity abstracted from everyday bodily experience, especially pertaining to vision, space, motion, and force. Image schemas are seen as basic, “preconceptual” structures that give rise to more elaborate and more abstract conceptions (or at least provide their skeletal organization) through combination and metaphorical projection.6 As shown in ﬁgure 2.1, for instance, the concept ENTER can be analyzed as a combination of the image schemas object, source-path-goal, and container-content.
An imagistic approach is no less capable than a propositional one of precisely describing complex structures in terms of simpler conceptual components. It is arguably

5 The issue is whether conceptualization per se is discrete and propositional in nature, independently of the discrete, propositional format imposed by linguistic encoding. Is thought itself “language-like” at all levels? Does the concept of a triangle, for example, decompose into propositions in the manner of ﬁg. 1.1(a)?
6 Johnson 1987; Lakoff 1987, 1990; Hampe 2005. Examples cited by Johnson are container, blockage, enablement, path, cycle, part-whole, full-empty, iteration, surface, balance, counterforce, attraction, link, near-far, merging, matching, contact, object, compulsion, restraint removal, mass-count, center-periphery, scale, splitting, superimposition, process, and collection. Note that diagrams like those in ﬁg. 2.1 are not to be identiﬁed per se as image schemas (which are patterns of mental activity) but are merely intended to evoke them and suggest their nature.

CONCEPTUAL SEMANTICS

advantageous because—as seen by comparing (2) with ﬁgure 2.1—the nature of a mental experience is reﬂected more directly in a complex image than in a complex formula. Also, images seem particularly well suited (and formulas unsuited) for certain aspects of conception. Central to the concept of a trumpet, for instance, is a visual image of its shape, as well as an auditory image of its sound. Furthermore, the characterization of image schemas as patterns of activity dovetails quite nicely with the intrinsic dynamicity of conceptualization. I thus look with favor on an image-schematic approach to conceptual structure. Certainly I assume that the notions cited as image schemas function as components of more elaborate conceptual conﬁgurations.
Still, there has been some vagueness about the notion of image schemas, their inventory, and the criteria for identifying them. I am not at all sure that the examples commonly cited (n. 6) form a coherent or naturally delimited class. While adopting an imagistic orientation, for my own purposes I prefer to distinguish several kinds of fundamental notions, each “basic” in its own way and useful for the characterization of more complex structures:
1. Basic in one sense are minimal concepts in particular domains of experience. I have in mind such notions as line, angle, and curvature, in the spatial domain; brightness and focal colors, in vision; precedence, in time; and the kinesthetic sensation of exerting muscular force.
2. Also minimal, but independent of any particular experiential domain, are highly schematic conﬁgurational concepts, e.g. contrast, boundary, change, continuity, contact, inclusion, separation, proximity, multiplicity, group, and point vs. extension. Being abstract and applicable to most any domain, these come closest to the apparent spirit of image schemas.
3. Some notions commonly cited as image schemas fall instead in my third class, conceptual archetypes. These are experientially grounded concepts so frequent and fundamental in our everyday life that the label archetype does not seem inappropriate. Here are some examples: a physical object, an object in a location, an object moving through space, the human body, the human face, a whole and its parts, a

34

PRELIMINARIES

physical container and its contents, seeing something, holding something, handing something to someone, exerting force to effect a desired change, a face-to-face social encounter. These notions are fairly schematic, but considerably less so than the conﬁgurational concepts. Some are incorporated as components of others. While they can be quite complex and hard to describe explicitly (try explaining what a physical object is!), they are basic in the sense that they are readily apprehended as coherent conceptual gestalts at an early developmental stage.

I do not regard this three-way distinction as either clear-cut or the only useful classiﬁcation. Certainly connections can be established among elements of the different groups. The minimal concept of a line, for example, bears an obvious afﬁnity to the conﬁgurational notion of extension, as well as to the conceptual archetype of an object moving along a spatial path. Moreover, since all conceptions are dynamic (residing in processing activity), there is no sharp boundary between simple concepts and certain basic cognitive abilities. We can describe focal red as either a minimal concept or else the ability to perceive this color. Instead of describing contrast, group, and extension as conﬁgurational concepts, we can equally well speak of the ability to detect a contrast, to group a set of constitutive entities, and to mentally scan through a domain.
The essential point is that conceptions can be “basic” in very different ways. This makes possible a general CG proposal about certain grammatical notions that are fundamental and possibly universal. Minimally, these notions include noun, verb, subject, object, and possessive. The proposal has several parts:

1. Each such notion can be characterized semantically in terms of both a prototype, valid for central instances, and a schema instantiated by all instances.
2. The prototypical meaning consists of an experientially grounded conceptual archetype.
3. The schematic meaning resides in a domain-independent cognitive ability. 4. The basic abilities are initially manifested in the corresponding arche-
types. Presumably innate, the abilities make it possible for structured experience, based on these archetypes, to occur in the ﬁrst place. 5. At a later developmental stage, these same abilities are extended to other domains of experience, where their application is less automatic (hence more apparent).

Let us see how this works in the case of nouns.7

1. The noun category has both a semantic prototype and a semantic schema.
2. The prototype is the conception of a physical object.

7 All the notions cited are described semantically in later chapters (nouns in ch. 4).

CONCEPTUAL SEMANTICS

35

3. Providing the schematic characterization is our capacity for conceptual grouping.
4. Developmentally, conceptual grouping is ﬁrst manifested in the apprehension of physical objects, the noun category prototype.
5. It ﬁgures subsequently in the apprehension of the many other kinds of entities also coded by nouns.

I view the ability to perceive a discrete physical object, like a ball, as a lowlevel, essentially automatic manifestation of the same capacity more transparently involved in mentally forming a single entity by grouping the constitutive elements of an orchard, team, stack, alphabet, or archipelago. For most linguistic purposes, a noun like ball and a noun like orchard function alike (as singular, common, count nouns). Although the constitutive elements and their conceptual grouping are more evident with orchard, in each case the conception of a unitary entity emerges through cognitive processing at some level. The world does not present itself to us as a ﬁnished, predetermined structure, nor is apprehending the world like xeroxing a document. Even in the realm of concrete reality, its apprehension resides in dynamic, interactive processing activity. This is not to deny that the world is highly structured, so that certain ways of apprehending it are most likely to prove successful for both individuals and species. Because our own species has evolved to cope with the world successfully, we all comprehend it in largely commensurate ways that are grounded in common bodily experience. We all perceive physical objects and employ the same grouping capacity to recognize collective entities like an orchard or an archipelago.
Our apprehension of the world is thus active, dynamic, and constructive in nature. A fundamentally important consequence is that the conceptions evoked as linguistic meanings are nontransparent: they do not simply reﬂect or correspond to the world in a wholly straightforward manner, nor are they derivable in any direct or automatic way from objective circumstances. Instead, a conceptualist semantics must start by recognizing the prevalence—indeed, the utter pervasiveness—of imaginative devices and mental constructions. It is not merely that we frequently talk about imaginary worlds (like those of movies, fairy tales, soap operas, mythology, and linguistic theories). We further demonstrate our imaginative capacity in constructing and manipulating an extraordinary variety of mental spaces (Fauconnier 1985, 1997). Some types of mental spaces, respectively exempliﬁed in (3), are those representing a hypothetical situation, a particular person’s beliefs, the situation obtaining at a certain time or place, and the content of reported speech.

world is metaphor, where basic organizational features of one conceptual domain— usually more directly grounded in bodily experience—are projected onto another (Lakoff and Johnson 1980, 1999; Turner 1987). In (4), aspects of the source domain, pertaining to the manipulation of physical objects, are projected metaphorically onto the target domain of understanding and communicating ideas.

(4) (a) I couldn’t grasp what she was saying. (b) We were tossing some ideas around. (c) The message went right over his head. (d) He didn’t catch my drift.

Metaphor is one source of blending, in which selected features of two conceptions are combined to form a third (Fauconnier and Turner 1998, 2002). As hybrid mental constructions, blends are often quite fanciful but nonetheless are genuine objects of conception and linguistic expression. The entities portrayed in (4) as being grasped, thrown, and caught—combining as they do the abstract nature of ideas with certain physical properties of balls or other projectiles—cannot exist in reality. Neither do such blended creatures as mermaids and werewolves (let alone beagles who think in English sentences and imagine themselves as World War I pilots), but that does not stop us from thinking and talking about them. Even for the kinds of entities that do exist, what we refer to linguistically is often a virtual (or ﬁctive) instance, i.e. an imaginary instance “conjured up” for some purpose. Cars exist, for example, but the car referred to in (5)(a) does not (it makes no sense to ask Which car doesn’t your brother have?). It is rather an imagined instance invoked for the purpose of specifying the circumstance that is being negated.

(5) (a) My brother doesn’t have a car. (b) A kitten likes to chase a piece of string.

Likewise, the kitten and the piece of string mentioned in (5)(b) are virtual entities conjured up to make a global generalization. The statement does not pertain to any particular kitten or piece of string, nor to any actual chasing event.

2.1.3 Where Does Meaning Stop?
At any given moment, we engage in conceptualizing activity at different levels of awareness and in varied domains of mental experience. It draws on many types of abilities (perceptual, motor, intellectual) and vast stores of knowledge (particular and general; physical, social, and cultural; individual, conventional, and contextual). The problems we now address pertain to the boundary between “linguistic” and “extralinguistic” concerns. What in all this counts as language? Which particular skills and bits of knowledge can we speciﬁcally characterize as being linguistic? Accompanying the production or understanding of any linguistic expression is a complex and multifaceted stream of conceptualization. How much of this should we identify as its linguistic meaning?

CONCEPTUAL SEMANTICS

37

Standard doctrine holds that discrete boundaries ought to be expected. Language is commonly viewed as an autonomous mental “faculty” (Fodor 1983), so that knowledge of a language is fully describable by a large but limited set of statements. Linguists who reject this modular outlook still tend to posit a deﬁnite boundary between linguistic and extralinguistic knowledge, dividing the global understanding of expressions into linguistic meaning per se versus what can be pragmatically inferred. Nevertheless, received wisdom often proves erroneous. We need to ask whether these discrete boundaries are discovered by linguists or imposed on the basis of theoretical preconception. The answer, I believe, is clearly the latter: the linguistic and the extralinguistic form a gradation rather than being sharply distinct. While there are limits to linguistic meaning, and valid distinctions can be drawn, imposing speciﬁc boundaries is both arbitrary and misleading.
These issues arise for any aspect of language (FCG1: §2.1.2), but here the focus is meaning. We can start with lexical items, where two basic questions need to be considered. First, how many distinguishable meanings—often called senses—should be attributed to a given lexeme? Second, how much information do these senses include?
A lexical item used with any frequency is almost invariably polysemous: it has multiple, related meanings that have all been conventionalized to some degree. Among these related senses, some are more central, or prototypical, than others, and some are schemas that are elaborated (or instantiated) by others. To some extent the senses are linked by categorizing relationships to form a network.8 Figure 2.2 is a partial network plausibly suggested for the noun ring (brieﬂy discussed in §1.3.1). The boxes drawn with heavy lines indicate the most prototypical senses. The arrows represent categorizing relationships: solid arrows for the elaboration of a schema, and dashed arrows for extension from a more central meaning.

figure 2.2
8 For examples and discussion, see the following: Geeraerts 1993; Tuggy 1993, 2003a, 2003b; Tyler and Evans 2003; Riemer 2005. This network model is useful up to a point, but it may imply greater discreteness and speciﬁcity than is psychologically realistic. An alternative metaphor for complex categories is proposed at the end of §8.1.3.

38

PRELIMINARIES

An alternative is to claim that lexical items are monosemous, each having a single abstract meaning from which all its uses can be predicted (Ruhl 1989; Huffman 1997). Positing more speciﬁc senses, it is argued, leads to an uncontrolled proliferation of putative “meanings” that are better regarded as contextual interpretations of an item’s abstract semantic value. I would counter by denying that a single abstract meaning enables one to predict, in full and precise detail, the actual range of speciﬁc senses in which a lexical item is conventionally employed. I can imagine a highly schematic meaning for ring—perhaps some abstract notion of enclosure—that would subsume all the more speciﬁc values depicted in ﬁgure 2.2. From this alone, however, one could hardly predict that ring would have exactly the set of particular uses that it manifests, to the exclusion of countless others (equally motivated by cognitive and communicative factors) that it lacks. Why should the term be used for arenas and groups of smugglers but not, say, for rubber bands?
Thus a single abstract meaning does not fully describe a lexical item’s established semantic value. Such a meaning should always be sought, and—if found— incorporated in the polysemy network. By itself, though, it fails to represent a speaker’s knowledge of how the expression is conventionally used and understood. This knowledge (surely part of knowing a language) resides in the entire network. To allay any fears, positing such networks does not result in an uncontrolled proliferation of senses. Meanings (like other linguistic structures) are recognized as part of a language only to the extent that they are (i) entrenched in the minds of individual speakers and (ii) conventional for members of a speech community. Only a limited array of senses satisfy these criteria and qualify as established linguistic units. But since entrenchment and conventionalization are inherently matters of degree, there is no discrete boundary between senses which have and which lack the status of established units. We ﬁnd instead a gradation leading from novel interpretations, through incipient senses, to established linguistic meanings.
What does a particular lexical meaning include? If a lexical item (in one of its senses) refers to a certain type of entity, how much of our total knowledge of such entities constitutes its linguistic semantic value? Is there some portion of this knowledge that one possesses just by virtue of speaking a language?
Traditionally, this last question is answered in the afﬁrmative. A lexical meaning is thought to consist of relatively few semantic features or descriptive statements, speciﬁcally linguistic in character, that are clearly distinguished from general knowledge concerning the type of entity referred to. The basic sense of bull, for example, is often represented by the semantic features [MALE], [ADULT], and [BOVINE], to the exclusion of anything else we might know about these creatures (e.g. their role in bullﬁghts and rodeos). In this respect a lexical meaning would be more like a dictionary entry than an article in an encyclopedia. This approach is thus described metaphorically as the dictionary view of linguistic semantics, diagrammed in ﬁgure 2.3(a). The circle represents the total body of knowledge speakers have about the type of entity in question. Indicated by the heavy-line box is the small, discrete set of speciﬁcations constituting the lexical item’s meaning.
These “purely linguistic” meanings have proved elusive. It has not been shown that precise boundaries can be drawn in a principled manner (Bolinger 1965; Haiman 1980), nor can descriptions like [MALE ADULT BOVINE] be considered

linguistically adequate. An alternative view, metaphorically referred to as encyclopedic semantics, is generally adopted in cognitive linguistics (FCG1: §4.2; cf. Wierzbicka 1995). In this approach, a lexical meaning resides in a particular way of accessing an open-ended body of knowledge pertaining to a certain type of entity. This knowledge is represented in ﬁgure 2.3(b) by a series of concentric circles, indicating that the knowledge components have varying degrees of centrality. This ranking for centrality is one facet of a lexical item’s conventionally established value. For a given lexical meaning, certain speciﬁcations are so central that they are virtually always activated whenever the expression is used, while others are activated less consistently, and others are so peripheral that they are accessed only in special contexts. In ﬁgure 2.3(b), each heavy-line ellipse stands for the set of speciﬁcations activated on a single occasion. There need be no speciﬁcation activated on every occasion, and every use may well involve a unique pattern of activation.
On the encyclopedic view, a lexical meaning is neither totally free nor totally ﬁxed. It is not totally free because the expression evokes a certain range of knowledge and speciﬁes a particular way of accessing it. It is not totally ﬁxed because centrality (preferential access) is a matter of degree and subject to being overridden by contextual factors. This conception (developed further in §2.2) is both linguistically and psychologically realistic. While it does have the consequence that no discrete boundary can be drawn between linguistic and extralinguistic knowledge, any such boundary ought to be drawn on empirical grounds, not imposed a priori.
A comparable issue arises with respect to the meanings of complex expressions, such as sentences. When uttered in context, a sentence may invoke or convey considerably more than what it actually says. Owing to the previous discourse, to interpretive abilities, as well as to general and contextual knowledge, its full understanding may be far more elaborate than anything derivable from the meanings of overt elements. How much of this global understanding is properly identiﬁed as the expression’s linguistic meaning? Or as the question is usually posed, which facets of it belong to semantics (reﬂecting the language per se) and which are better left for pragmatics?
The traditional position, that there is a deﬁnite boundary, reﬂects a modular view of language. This supposed modularity starts at the lexical level. Lexical items are thought of as building blocks, discrete units that are stacked in various arrangements to form complex expressions fully determined by the units and the patterns followed in arranging them. In semantics, this is known as the principle of full compositionality

40

PRELIMINARIES

(an expression’s meaning is predictably derivable from the meanings of its parts). The assumption of full compositionality implies a clear and deﬁnite distinction between semantics (compositionally determined meaning) and pragmatics (contextual interpretation). This is crucial for the claim of modularity made at a higher level, with respect to a language overall: that it is a well-delimited, self-contained system sharply distinct from other facets of cognition.9
Though standard, this modular conception is gratuitous and (I would argue) erroneous. I do not believe that a ﬁxed boundary between semantics and pragmatics can be drawn on a principled basis in a way that makes linguistic sense.
A distinction can indeed be made between semantics and pragmatics. An expression’s full contextual understanding goes beyond what can be determined from established linguistic units. Suppose we are looking at a cat, and I say The bird is safe. With this statement I may implicate that the cat is lazy or incompetent (relying on the context, encyclopedic knowledge of cats, and a general presumption of relevance), but I would not consider this to be part of its linguistic meaning. I therefore object when Levinson (1997: 19) characterizes me as a “stubborn ostrich” who “refuse[s] to countenance the existence of pragmatics.”10 He misinterprets my statement that “the distinction between semantics and pragmatics . . . is largely artifactual” by ignoring the further clariﬁcation that a viable linguistic semantics needs to avoid “such false dichotomies” (FCG1: 154). What is being denied is the strictly dichotomous view depicted in ﬁgure 2.4(a), with a ﬁxed and deﬁnite boundary between two separate components. This denial does not entail either the nonexistence of pragmatics, as sketched in diagram (b), or the absence of any differentiation, as in (c). The claim, instead, is that semantics and pragmatics form a gradation, as shown in (d), with no precise boundary between the two. But toward either extreme of the scale lie phenomena that are indisputably either semantic or pragmatic.
At issue, then, is whether a discrete boundary can be found (not just arbitrarily imposed). Can we justiﬁably ascribe to complex expressions a level of “purely

figure 2.4
9 It is further assumed that a linguistic system is divisible into discrete “components” (such as lexicon, morphology, and syntax). I argue against this in §1.3. 10 If I am a stubborn ostrich, it is for other reasons.

CONCEPTUAL SEMANTICS

linguistic” meaning that is strictly predictable from the meanings of their parts? A variety of considerations suggest that the answer is negative. For one thing, the very question presupposes that the parts have clearly delimited linguistic meanings. That is, it presupposes the dictionary view of lexical semantics, which we have seen to be problematic. The alternative, encyclopedic approach entails that even the putative “building blocks” are ﬂexibly construed. Rather than being fully pre-formed modules, with ﬁxed and limited content, lexical items reside in conventional paths of access to domains of knowledge—not exclusively linguistic—that are evoked both variably and probabilistically. Even at this level we ﬁnd a gradation between linguistic and extralinguistic knowledge.
When we consider semantic composition, the inappropriateness of the classic building block metaphor is even more evident. This is not to deny the existence of compositional patterns (in CG they constitute the semantic poles of schematic symbolic assemblies). The question is whether, starting from lexical meanings, these patterns alone give rise to semantic representations that are sufﬁciently coherent and self-contained to have any kind of independent cognitive status, or approximate anything recognizable as the meanings of complex expressions. Instead (ironically), I agree with Levinson (1997: 18–19) that indisputably “semantic” representations of this sort—compositionally derived from lexical building blocks—are “deeply inadequate mental orphans, which serve so effectively in human communication only through the rich interpretive principles we bring to bear on their development.”
Among these interpretive principles are those discussed in the previous section: metaphor, blending, mental space construction, and the invocation of ﬁctive entities. Calling me a stubborn ostrich was presumably not an attempt at biological classiﬁcation but rather an instance of metaphor. By projecting selected features of the source domain (ostriches) onto the target domain (people), this metaphor creates the blended conception of a person who exhibits the fancied ostrich behavior of burying its head in the sand. This hybrid creature is only ﬁctive; nobody believes that it actually exists. Yet, without describing it explicitly, the expression was speciﬁcally intended to evoke it metaphorically. Furthermore, the statement that this ﬁctive ostrich/ person refuses to countenance the existence of pragmatics induces the construction of mental spaces representing a belief and an attitude. It ascribes to the blended creature the belief that pragmatics does not exist, with the aim of imputing this belief (incorrectly) to its correspondent in the target domain (me). The attitude consists of being unwilling to even entertain the possibility that pragmatics exists. Since unwillingness implies that an option must at least be considered, the expression sets up a mental space that contains it, but only as an imagined potential occurrence. The creature’s contemplating the possible existence of pragmatics is thus invoked as a virtual entity, conjured up just for purposes of indicating what might have been the case but actually is not.
The example is not at all unusual. When producing or understanding linguistic expressions, we engage in elaborate, highly sophisticated processes of conceptual construction, drawing on many and varied resources. Among these are lexical meanings and compositional patterns, as traditionally recognized. Another resource is our impressively rich imaginative capacity, featuring such devices as metaphor, blending, ﬁctivity, and mental spaces. Moreover, the mental constructions evident in

42

PRELIMINARIES

normal language use are critically reliant on general and contextual knowledge. For instance, my characterization as a stubborn ostrich exploited the folk conception, prevalent in our culture, that an ostrich buries its head in the sand to avoid facing up to problems. It is this notion (hardly part of a dictionary deﬁnition) that makes the full expression coherent, by providing a link between ostrich and refuses to countenance the existence of pragmatics.
Or consider once more The bird is safe, uttered while looking at a cat. The word safe implies potential danger, which in this context the speaker and hearer understand as residing in the feline. Safe might then be analyzed as an abbreviated way of saying safe from the cat, the context permitting elliptic expression. Though tacit, reference to the cat is not unreasonably viewed as part of the expression’s linguistic meaning; after all, it corresponds to something (a source of danger) inherent in the meaning of safe.11 Furthermore, in the same context it would also be felicitous to say the following: The bird is safe, because it’s smarter. Here the cat is invoked not only as a source of danger but also, more saliently, as a standard of comparison. I doubt that a conceptualization excluding it would actually occur or be recognizable as what the utterance means.
An expression’s meaning presupposes an extensive, multifaceted conceptual substrate that supports it, shapes it, and renders it coherent. Among the facets of this substrate are (i) the conceptions evoked or created through the previous discourse; (ii) engagement in the speech event itself, as part of the interlocutors’ social interaction; (iii) apprehension of the physical, social, and cultural context; and (iv) any domains of knowledge that might prove relevant. Contributing in no small measure to both the substrate and its subsequent elaboration are imaginative and interpretive phenomena (such as metaphor, blending, ﬁctivity, and mental space construction). All of this provides the setting for lexical interpretation and semantic composition. Contrary to the traditional modular view, these do not proceed autonomously or in a vacuum. A lexical item does not have a fully determinate meaning. Instead, its semantic value resides in conventional paths of access (some well-trodden, others less so) to open-ended domains of knowledge. Precisely what it means on a given occasion—which portions of this encyclopedic knowledge are activated, and to what degree—depends on all the factors cited. Likewise, patterns of semantic composition are only one of the resources exploited in the process of conceptual construction producing the meanings of complex expressions. This overall process results in highly elaborate conceptualizations whose construction is merely prompted by lexical meanings and compositional patterns, which are usually not themselves sufﬁcient to derive them. I thus describe language as exhibiting only partial compositionality.
What should then be recognized as an expression’s linguistic meaning? I suggest the following, nontechnical deﬁnition: besides elements that are indisputably semantic, an expression’s meaning includes as much additional structure as is needed to render the conceptualization coherent and reﬂect what speakers would naively regard as being meant and said, while excluding factors that are indisputably pragmatic and not necessary to make sense of what is linguistically encoded. Admittedly, this is vague and

11 This is not so for the possible implication that the cat is lazy or incompetent, cited previously as a case of pragmatic inference beyond the scope of linguistic meaning.

CONCEPTUAL SEMANTICS

does not allow one to draw a line in any particular place, even for speciﬁc examples. But I also consider it appropriate. I prefer a realistic notion of linguistic meaning that is only fuzzily delimited and partially compositional, as opposed to one that (by deﬁnition) is precisely delimited and fully compositional, but whose cognitive status is quite dubious. My feeling is that focusing on the latter represents an artiﬁcial exercise, directed at something that may not exist at all, has no autonomous status if it does, and in any case represents only a small portion of the overall problem.

2.2 Conceptual Content
Linguistic meaning resides in conceptualization, which I have so far characterized as being dynamic, interactive, imagistic (as opposed to propositional), and imaginative (involving metaphor, blending, ﬁctivity, and mental space construction). Important though they are, these general properties are not themselves adequate for describing conceptual structure in explicit detail. As the basis for semantic and grammatical description, we must now consider more speciﬁc proposals.
Most broadly, a meaning consists of both conceptual content and a particular way of construing that content. The term construal refers to our manifest ability to conceive and portray the same situation in alternate ways.12 An initial example is sketched in ﬁgure 2.5. The content in question is the conception of a glass containing water occupying just half of its volume. At the conceptual level, we are presumably able to evoke this content in a fairly neutral manner. But as soon as we encode it linguistically, we necessarily impose a certain construal. Four such options are shown in the diagram, each corresponding to a distinct expression. The semantic contrast depicted (by means of heavy lines) lies in what the expressions designate (or refer to) within the conceived situation:13 (1) the glass with water in it designates the container; (2) the water in the glass designates the liquid it contains; (3) the glass is halffull designates the relationship wherein the volume occupied by the liquid is just half of its potential volume; and (4) the glass is half-empty designates the relationship wherein the volume occupied by the void is just half of its potential volume.
The distinction between content and construal is not at all a sharp one. For instance, level of speciﬁcity—an aspect of construal—has a direct bearing on the content evoked: precisely because they differ in speciﬁcity, the glass with water in it has more content than the container with liquid in it (another way of coding the situation in ﬁgure 2.5). The distinction is nonetheless useful for expository purposes, as it highlights the essential point that conceptual meaning involves more than just truth conditions or the objective circumstances being described. Indeed, the meaning of many linguistic elements—especially those considered “grammatical”—consists primarily in the construal they impose, rather than any speciﬁc content. Yet every element evokes some content (however schematic it might be), and conversely, any content evoked is construed in some fashion. Content is the topic of this section. Construal is addressed in chapter 3.
12 The term construal is preferable to imagery, used in certain earlier works, since the latter lends itself to confusion with more familiar applications (FCG1: 110).
13 Called proﬁling, this aspect of construal is discussed in §3.3.1.

44

PRELIMINARIES

figure 2.5
2.2.1 Domains
Linguistic meaning involves both conceptual content and the construal imposed on that content. To have a uniform way of referring to content, the term domain is adopted in CG. An expression is said to invoke a set of cognitive domains as the basis for its meaning (i.e. as the content to be construed).14 Collectively, this set of domains is called a matrix. For most expressions the matrix is complex in the sense of comprising multiple domains.
What is a domain, exactly? To serve its purpose, the term is broadly interpreted as indicating any kind of conception or realm of experience. Among the domains ﬁguring in the content of ﬁgure 2.5, for example, are space, the sensation of wetness, the speciﬁc concept WATER (partly deﬁned in terms of wetness), the more schematic concept LIQUID (immanent in WATER), the conception of a container and its contents, the more elaborate conception of ﬁlling a container with liquid, notions of volume and equality (hence equality of volume), as well as our knowledge of the cultural practice of ﬁlling a glass with water for the purpose of drinking it. We should not expect to arrive at any exhaustive list of the domains in a matrix or any unique way to divide an expression’s content among them—how many domains we recognize, and which ones, depends on our purpose and to some extent is arbitrary. The important thing is to recognize the diverse and multifaceted nature of the conceptual content an expression evokes.
Obviously, many conceptions incorporate others or are in some sense reducible to more fundamental notions. Domains for which this is not the case are said to be basic. A basic domain is therefore cognitively irreducible, neither derivable from nor analyzable into other conceptions. Though I cannot give a deﬁnite inventory, some prime examples are space, time, and the ranges of unanalyzed experience associated with the various senses: color space (the range of colors we are capable of experiencing), pitch (the range of pitches we can perceive), temperature, taste and smell, and so on. In and of themselves, basic domains are not concepts or conceptualizations. They are better thought of as realms of experiential
14 The selection of domains is itself an aspect of construal, reinforcing the point that the distinction between content and construal is not absolute.

CONCEPTUAL SEMANTICS

potential, within which conceptualization can occur and speciﬁc concepts can emerge. For instance, color space—as the range of possible color sensations—is not the same as any particular color experience on a particular occasion (a kind of conceptualization), nor is it a color concept (e.g. RED). Likewise, space supports the conception of spatial conﬁgurations and time the conception of change. As basic domains, however, these are not themselves concepts but simply the spatial and temporal extensionality in which conﬁgurations are manifested and change unfolds.15
Most domains are nonbasic.16 Of the ones listed above for ﬁgure 2.5, all are nonbasic except for space. Any kind of conceptualization counts as a nonbasic domain capable of being exploited for semantic purposes. Conceptions fall under this rubric whether they are sensory or intellectual, static or dynamic, ﬁxed or novel, simple or complex. Included as nonbasic domains are instances of immediate sensory, emotive, and motor/kinesthetic experience (e.g. the sensation of wetness, of being afraid, or of blowing up a balloon), as well as the abstracted products of intellectual operations (e.g. concepts like JUSTICE, VERTEBRATE, and BATTING AVERAGE). Also included are conceptions manifested instantaneously at the level of conscious awareness (e.g. the image of a circle), as well as elaborate scenarios that we can only conceptualize stage by stage through processing time (like the successive steps in a complicated recipe). There is no requirement that a nonbasic domain be ﬁxed, established, or conventionally recognized. Apprehension of the situational context thus qualiﬁes as a cognitive domain, as does the previous discourse.
Nonbasic domains vary greatly in their degree of conceptual complexity. They range from minimal concepts (e.g. RED), to more elaborate conceptions (like the conﬁguration of the human body), to entire systems of knowledge (such as everything we know about baseball). To some extent they arrange themselves in hierarchies, such that a conception at a given level presupposes and incorporates one or more lower-level conceptions. For instance, the concept APPLE incorporates RED; NECK invokes the overall shape of a body; and BATTING AVERAGE presupposes some knowledge of both arithmetic and baseball. In cases of this sort, where one conception—asymetrically—presupposes another as part of its own characterization, they are said to occupy higher and lower levels of conceptual organization. Numerous levels of conceptual organization can often be discerned even in simple examples. In the case of ENTER (ﬁg. 2.1), the concept of a physical object is one component of the higher-level conception of an object moving from source to goal along a spatial path. Along with the container-content schema, this is then incorporated as part of

15 These basic domains are not per se the meanings of the words space and time. Their meanings are higher-order conceptions in which the dimensions function in their own right as objects of contemplation, rather than merely supporting spatial and temporal conceptualization. Similarly, the metaphorical construal of basic domains (e.g. in a moment, bright sound, sharp taste) results in conceptions that are not irreducible and are hence nonbasic.
16 The term abstract domain, used in previous works, is infelicitous because many nonbasic conceptions pertain to physical circumstances.

46

PRELIMINARIES

ENTER, at the next higher level. In turn, ENTER is invoked for the characterization of ENTRANCE, and so on indeﬁnitely.
Such hierarchies are a fundamental aspect of conceptual structure and thus essential to semantics. Few linguistic meanings lend themselves to being directly and solely described in terms of basic domains or a putative set of primitive concepts.17 Most expressions are best characterized with respect to higher-level notions whose relation to basic ones can be mediated by any number of intervening levels. As the basis for their meaning and hence the starting point for semantic description, expressions invoke conceptualizations at any level of organization and with any degree of complexity.
Consider the word sophomore. Among the elements that ﬁgure in its meaning are the basic domains of time and space, as well as such lower-level concepts as PERSON, KNOW, YEAR, and TWO, and higher-level notions such as LEARN, STUDY, STUDENT, and SCHOOL. Clearly, though, the meaning of sophomore further—and crucially—invokes a still higher-level conception of the sort that Fillmore (1982) calls a frame and Lakoff (1987) refers to as an idealized cognitive model (or ICM). This is the idealized conception, quite familiar in our culture, of a nonelementary educational institution offering a course of study lasting precisely four years. While it incorporates the lower-level concepts, this ICM taken as a whole is the natural starting point for semantic description: with respect to it, we need only specify that sophomore designates a person in the second year of study. We can say that the ICM provides the expression’s conceptual content, the basis for its meaning, which results from construing this content in a certain manner. In particular, sophomore is construed as designating (proﬁling) a student in the second year (as opposed to freshman, junior, and senior, which have the same basic content but designate students in other years).
At this point some terminological clariﬁcation may be helpful. We seem to have a lot of terms that might all be applied to the same conceptual phenomenon: concept, conception, conceptualization, (nonbasic) domain, frame, and idealized cognitive model. Although usage varies and the contrasts are subtle, I should at least indicate how I myself tend to understand the terms.
The distinction between the ﬁrst three terms and the second three is basically a matter of perspective: the former pertain to a notion considered in its own right, whereas the latter highlight its role in describing linguistic meanings. Within the ﬁrst group of words, conception neutralizes the distinction between concept, which suggests a ﬁxed or static notion, and conceptualization, which suggests dynamicity. However, since every conception is dynamic if viewed on a small enough time scale, conceptualization is also employed as a fully general term. The terms in the second group are often interchangeable. We can say, for instance, that sophomore derives its meaning by imposing a particular construal on the content supplied by a domain, a frame, or an ICM.18 Yet these terms are not quite equivalent. Domain has the greatest

17 This is clearly recognized by Wierzbicka (1996), who does base her descriptions on a set of irreducible semantic primitives (identiﬁed as lexical universals), but also posits hierarchies where a concept at any level incorporates simpler concepts previously assembled.
18 Naturally, the resulting concept((ualizat)ion) may function in turn as a domain/frame/ICM for another expression (e.g. sophomore yearbook).

CONCEPTUAL SEMANTICS

generality, since neither frame nor ICM applies very well to basic domains (e.g. time or color space). A frame may be roughly comparable to a nonbasic domain. If the words idealized and model are taken seriously, idealized cognitive model has the narrowest range of application. It would not, for example, apply to the ongoing discourse or the physical circumstances of the speech event.19

2.2.2 Accessing Domains
The set of domains an expression invokes is called its conceptual matrix. Usually there are multiple domains, in which case the matrix is said to be complex. In describing an expression’s matrix, it is not sufﬁcient merely to list the constitutive domains. How they relate to one another, and how they are mentally accessed, are an important dimension of linguistic meaning.
An instructive way to start is by considering one example in fair detail. The expression chosen is glass, in the ordinary sense whereby it designates a container used for drinking. Here are some of the domains that evidently ﬁgure in its conceptual characterization:
1. Space [a basic domain]. 2. Shape [roughly that of a cylinder, closed at one end]. This nonbasic
domain presupposes space, as the domain in which a shape conception is manifested. 3. Typical orientation in space [long dimension aligned along the vertical axis, with the closed end at the bottom]. Among the other domains this incorporates are space, verticality, and the shape conception. 4. Function1 [container for liquid]. This presupposes the typical orientation, the concept of a liquid, and that of a container (which in turn incorporates such notions as spatial inclusion, potential motion, force, and constancy through time). 5. Function2 [role in the process of drinking]. This incorporates function1, as well as the conception of the human body, of grasping, motion with the arm, ingestion, etc. 6. Material [usually the substance glass]. 7. Size [easily held in one hand]. 8. Others [domains pertaining to cost, washing, storage, dropping and breaking, position on a table at mealtime, matching sets, method of manufacture, and so on].
According to the encyclopedic view of linguistic semantics (§2.1.3), the potentially relevant domains are an open-ended set. The example clearly indicates that, rather than being disjoint, the domains of a complex matrix overlap with one another, often to the extent of full inclusion. An attempt to convey this diagrammatically is made in ﬁgure 2.6, where domains are shown as ellipses. The heavy-line circle

represents the entity designated by the expression (its proﬁle), which has some role in all the domains of the matrix.
Not captured in ﬁgure 2.6 are the varying degrees of centrality ascribable to the domains of a complex matrix.20 Centrality (FCG1: §4.2.2) is the likelihood of a particular domain being activated when an expression is used on a given occasion. Certain domains are so central that we can hardly use the expression without evoking them, some are activated less consistently, and others are so peripheral that we invoke them only in special circumstances, when they happen to be relevant. In our example (glass), domains 1 to 7 are clearly quite central, those listed under 8 more peripheral. A ranking for degree of centrality is depicted in ﬁgure 2.7. In this “exploded” diagram, the domains of a matrix are separately shown (ignoring their extensive overlap). The dotted lines, used for correspondence, indicate that the heavy-line circles all represent the same entity (namely the expression’s designatum, represented just once in ﬁgure 2.6).
The relative centrality of constitutive domains is one facet of linguistic meaning, important for the characterization of lexical items. As part of its conventional semantic value, a lexeme not only gives access to a set of domains, but does so preferentially, making some especially likely to be activated. Occasionally a semantic contrast

resides less in the inventory of accessible domains than in their degree of accessibility. Although the same object might be referred to as either a knife or a dagger, and either can be used for stabbing someone, this possible function is far more central to the meaning of dagger. Or consider the contrast between snail and escargot (accepting that the latter is now an English word). Encyclopedic semantics implies that the two expressions afford potential access to the same domain inventory: it is part of our encyclopedic knowledge of snails that they are sometimes cooked and eaten (especially in French restaurants), and we know that escargots are the same creatures that infest our gardens. Yet snail and escargot clearly have different meanings, the contrast residing in how the domains are ranked (i.e. degree of centrality). With escargot, the domain of fancy cuisine is ranked very high; it is primarily this domain that is accessed, others—like the domain of garden pests—being activated only if there is special motivation. With snail, on the other hand, the domain of fancy cuisine is peripheral but fairly accessible. It is therefore natural (at least linguistically) to say The snails were delicious, but hardly *My garden is crawling with escargots.21
Ranking for centrality implies that a lexical meaning, even if open-ended, is not totally free or unconstrained. A lexical item is partly deﬁned by the likelihood (sometimes approaching categorical status) of particular domains being activated. It thus incorporates conventional ways of accessing a certain range of encyclopedic knowledge. At the same time, a lexical meaning is never totally ﬁxed or invariable, for several reasons. First, the inclination for a given domain to be activated is probabilistic rather than absolute. A second reason is that the probabilities are subject to contextual modulation. Finally, they vary through time depending on the vicissitudes of usage.
These points seem fairly evident. That domains are activated with a certain probability is precisely what is meant by degree of centrality. Nor is there any doubt that the probabilities are altered by context and use. Contextual factors can obviously focus attention on a domain that might otherwise not be accessed at all or only at a lower level of activation. This in turn might lessen the activation of an otherwise salient speciﬁcation. If (6)(a) induces a canonical construal of glass, with domains 1 to 7 all being accessed, examples (6)(b)–(d) skew the pattern by highlighting various domains of lesser centrality: breaking, matching, placement, and washing.

(6) (a) He took another sip from his glass. (b) This antique glass is quite fragile. (c) The glasses on that table don’t match. (d) Plastic wine glasses are hard to wash.

Directing attention to such notions tends to push more central speciﬁcations (like the role of a glass in drinking) into the background. They can even be suppressed

21 Following standard linguistic practice, asterisks (and sometimes question marks) indicate that an expression is in some respect deviant or “ungrammatical”. The basis for these assessments is discussed in ch. 8.

or overridden. In (6)(d), wine and plastic override the default speciﬁcations of glass with respect to shape and material. Moreover, their collocation with glass occurs so commonly these days that the default status of these speciﬁcations may well be diminished. Usage has a constant impact by either reinforcing the probabilities or adjusting them.
A ranking of domains for centrality measures their likelihood of being accessed and strongly activated, other things being equal. Yet other things are never really equal, since language use is never truly acontextual; an expression’s manifestation is always subject to inﬂuence from the physical, linguistic, social, and psychological circumstances. Given a particular ranking, as depicted in ﬁgure 2.7, such inﬂuence results in speciﬁc patterns of activation representing a lexical item’s contextual implementation in actual usage events. This is shown in ﬁgure 2.8, where the thickness of a line indicates the degree to which a domain is activated. From one usage event to the next, the domains accessed are likely to vary, as well as their level of activation. This variable activation is one reason why an expression appears to have different values on different occasions. It may be that, strictly speaking, a lexeme is never used twice with exactly the same meaning.
Followed to their logical conclusion, these observations have certain theoretical consequences that I consider quite natural (though some would regard them as unfortunate). They imply the absence of any speciﬁc line of demarcation that strictly separates linguistic meaning from either general knowledge or contextual interpretation. Since the conceptualizations that function as linguistic meanings are neither distinct from these nor well delimited, semantic structure cannot be exhaustively described. Nor is semantics fully compositional, if only because the putative building blocks—lexical meanings—do not have constant values. Moreover, since language necessarily incorporates semantics, it does not constitute an autonomous, selfcontained “module” or “mental faculty”.22
2.2.3 Domains and Mental Spaces
A cognitive domain was deﬁned as any kind of conception or mental experience. The deﬁnition is very broad, intended to provide a uniform way of referring to anything exploited as the conceptual basis of linguistic meaning. Equally broad, and for a similar reason, is Fauconnier’s deﬁnition of a mental space (1997: 11): “Mental spaces . . . are partial structures that proliferate when we think and talk, allowing a

ﬁne-grained partitioning of our discourse and knowledge structures.” It is not obvious that any conceptual structure is strictly excluded by either deﬁnition, and in practice the terms have overlapping ranges of application. What, then, is the relation between these notions? Are both terms really necessary?
As I see it, anything called a domain could also be referred to as a mental space, and conversely. From a purely referential standpoint, therefore, a single term would be sufﬁcient. Yet referential coverage is not the only measure of a term’s utility; even in the technical sphere, the same entity is often describable by means of alternate expressions that highlight different facets of it.23 The terms domain and mental space represent nonequivalent ways of viewing conceptual structure, each reﬂecting a certain range of analytical concerns. Domain focuses on a conception’s unity and internal coherence. As a way of referring to conceptual content, it tends to be used for established conceptions in relation to lexical meanings. By contrast, mental space emphasizes conceptual discontinuities, the partitioning of conceptual structure into semiautonomous regions. It tends to be employed for the products of imaginative operations and the structures created dynamically in discourse. These are only tendencies, however, and both terms are vague enough for general application.
The phenomena generally dealt with in mental space theory, and the analyses proposed, are readily accommodated in CG. This is actually quite evident, since any kind of conception counts as a domain, and no restrictions are imposed on how the domains of a matrix are related to one another. Thus any mental space conﬁguration— including both the spaces and the connections linking them—can simply be incorporated as part of a matrix.
By way of illustration, consider the following metaphorical expression:

(7) The thought just ﬂew right out of my head.

Metaphor resides in a set of connections among a source space, a target space, and a blended space.24 The target space is the one being structured metaphorically. In (7), it is the common experience of entertaining a thought but subsequently—when wanting to express it—being unable to access it. The source space is the (usually less abstract) notion serving as the basis for metaphorical projection. On one interpretation of (7), the source is identiﬁed as the conception of a bird ﬂying out of a cage, with the consequence that the bird is no longer available for viewing. The blended space is the result of projecting the source onto the target. It is a hybrid conception, ﬁctive in nature, combining selected features of each input space.
The spaces and connections evoked in (7) are roughly depicted in ﬁgure 2.9. The elements of the source space are a bird (B), a cage (C), and a viewer (V). The bird is in the cage, where the viewer can see it (as indicated by a dashed arrow), but then

23 Referring to the same entity, for instance, a developer speaks of a unit, a contractor talks about a structure, and a realtor calls it a home (while the buyer just wants a house).
24 This is the terminology used in blending theory, based on mental spaces (Fauconnier 1997; Fauconnier and Turner 1998, 2002). Previously (starting with Lakoff and Johnson 1980), cognitive linguists working on metaphor spoke (equivalently) of mappings between a source domain and a target domain, without positing a blend.

ﬂies away (solid arrow) and becomes inaccessible. The elements of the target space are a thought (T), a person’s head (H), and that person’s “subject” (S)—that is, the subjective center of consciousness (Lakoff 1996). The dashed arrow represents the experience of having a thought, which subjectively occurs inside the head. Though not shown, the target scenario also includes a subsequent phase in which that thought is absent. Connections between spaces are given as dotted lines. Observe that connections are established between the bird and the thought, between the cage and the head, and between the viewer and the subject of consciousness. Further connections (not indicated, to simplify the diagram) hold between relationships in the two spaces: viewing a bird is likened to having a thought; and the bird ﬂying away is likened to the thought becoming inaccessible. These connections are the basis for the metaphorical construal.
The blended space is formed from the other two by merging connected elements into new, hybrid entities retaining some, but not all, of their properties. The ﬁctive, even fanciful nature of these imaginative creations does not make them mysterious or insigniﬁcant—on the contrary, they are crucial both conceptually and linguistically. The entity labeled T¢ blends the abstract nature of a thought with physical attributes of a bird, which enable it to ﬂy through space. H¢ is a head, but more speciﬁcally it is a head conceived as a container that can hold an object (the way a cage holds a bird). And while S¢ is still a “subject” (or center of consciousness), it combines with this the properties of a viewer able to look inside a container (H¢) and examine its contents. This blended space provides the essential content of (7): despite its ﬁctive character, the event that takes place there is precisely what the sentence directly describes.
In CG terms, each space in ﬁgure 2.9 qualiﬁes as a domain, as does the entire space conﬁguration. These spaces are part of the complex matrix comprising the expression’s conceptual content. The connections between spaces conform to the general observation that the domains of a matrix are related to one another in various ways, rather than being separate or disjoint. Connections are a special case of

correspondences (represented as dotted lines), which have multiple applications in CG (FCG1: §2.3.2).
The example raises the broader issue of how domains are related to particular linguistic expressions. The kind of relationship discussed in the previous section— where a ﬁxed expression provides a conventional way of accessing a certain set of domains—is by no means the only possibility. Besides simple lexical items (like glass), the overall picture must accommodate both novel and complex expressions, as well as their contextual and discourse interpretations.
For the most part, domains exist independently of any particular expression. They are not speciﬁcally linguistic, but conceptual resources that can be exploited for linguistic purposes. A given domain can thus be recruited for any number of different expressions. This is obviously true for basic domains such as time and space, which ﬁgure in the meanings of innumerable expressions without depending on any for their cognitive status. It is also true for many basic concepts (e.g. person, motion, physical object) and, on a lesser scale, for higher-order conceptions. For example, the practice of keeping a bird in a cage is easily accessible as part of the encyclopedic characterization of both bird and cage and is central to the meaning of birdcage. Moreover, this practice is commonly exploited in metaphorical expressions, even when there is no explicit reference to it, as seen in (7) and ﬁgure 2.9.
What happens when simpler expressions combine to form a more complex one? In principle, the matrix for the overall expression incorporates all the domains of the components. But it is not just the union of the component matrices. For one thing, as shown by birdcage, the composite expression provides its own way of accessing the constitutive domains. While the notion of keeping birds in cages is not peripheral with either bird or cage, taken individually, it is absolutely central to the meaning of the compound as a whole.25 By the same token, birdcage affords only indirect access to certain domains that are fairly central to its components (e.g. hatching from eggs for bird, zoo for cage). Moreover, it is possible for a composite expression to invoke a domain that does not ﬁgure saliently in the meaning of any component. For instance, the compound lipstick pertains to the cultural practice of females coating their lips with a colored substance, typically packaged in small cylinders encased in metal or plastic and carried in purses. This cultural model cannot be ascribed to the matrix of stick, and for lip it is quite peripheral (lip would seldom evoke it in a neutral context). More clearly, the conception of a British soldier is central to the meaning of redcoat but absent from the matrices of red and coat. Nor does any word in (7) evoke by itself the idea of someone looking in an empty birdcage—this only emerges through a process of conceptual construction triggered by the entire expression.
Among the domains evoked as the basis for meaning, but not conventionally associated with component elements, are those consisting in a speaker’s apprehension of the current discourse context. Suppose you are helping me put away the groceries. I see you there in the pantry holding several cans of tomatoes, with a quizzical

25 By itself, neither bird nor cage necessarily evokes the practice, but birdcage is virtually certain to do so. Each component reinforces this aspect of the other’s encyclopedic semantics.

look on your face. In this context, I might use any of the expressions in (8) to convey what is effectively the same message:

(8) (a) I want you to put the canned tomatoes on the top shelf of the pantry. (b) Put the tomatoes on the top shelf of the pantry. (c) Put them on the top shelf. (d) Tomatoes, top shelf. (e) On the top shelf. (f) On top.

Our shared apprehension of the situational context provides a conceptual substrate, various facets of which are overtly expressed. By virtue of this substrate, even the most fragmentary expressions are coherent and meaningful (indeed, the ﬁrst two seem needlessly verbose). I have deﬁned an expression’s meaning as including not only the content directly coded by overt elements but whatever additional structure is needed to render a conceptualization coherent and reﬂect what speakers would naively regard as being meant and said (§2.1.3). By this criterion, the meanings of all the expressions in (8) include at least the content expressed in (8)(a).26
This runs counter to conventional wisdom, which insists on a clear distinction between linguistic meaning and contextual interpretation. An expression’s meaning would be limited to what is strictly derivable from the (nonencyclopedic) meanings of its parts, and as such would be well-delimited, self-contained, acontextual, and fully compositional. It is thus no accident that sentence “fragments” like (8)(d)–(f) are traditionally ignored, for it is only the context that renders them coherent or supplies enough content to make them conceptually or communicatively useful. Such fragments are both normal and highly frequent in everyday language use, however. As seen in (8)(a)–(f), moreover, expressions cover the full spectrum in terms of what proportion of their essential content is contextually induced and what proportion is explicitly encoded. Insofar as possible, the entire spectrum of cases should be treated analogously. An expression is always understood with respect to some actual or imagined context. Only by avoiding an artiﬁcial dichotomy between linguistic meaning and contextual interpretation can we handle the full range of data in a uniﬁed manner.

26 If all the expressions in (8) should have the same content, they are nevertheless semantically nonequivalent owing to construal. In particular, they contrast in regard to which facets of the overall content are explicitly mentioned and thereby rendered prominent in relation to tacit elements.

3
Construal
An expression’s meaning is not just the conceptual content it evokes—equally
important is how that content is construed. As part of its conventional semantic value, every symbolic structure construes its content in a certain fashion. It is hard to resist the visual metaphor, where content is likened to a scene and construal to a particular way of viewing it. Importantly, CG does not claim that all meanings are based on space or visual perception,1 but the visual metaphor does suggest a way to classify the many facets of construal, if only for expository purposes. In viewing a scene, what we actually see depends on how closely we examine it, what we choose to look at, which elements we pay most attention to, and where we view it from. The corresponding labels I will use, for broad classes of construal phenomena, are speciﬁcity, focusing, prominence, and perspective. They apply to conceptions in any domain.
3.1 Speciﬁcity
One dimension of construal is the level of precision and detail at which a situation is characterized. I can describe the temperature by saying that it is hot, but also—with progressively greater speciﬁcity—by saying that it is in the 90s, about 95 degrees, or exactly 95.2 degrees. Similarly, aunt is more speciﬁc than relative, and large brown rat is more speciﬁc than rodent. Alternate terms are granularity and resolution. A highly speciﬁc expression describes a situation in ﬁne-grained detail, with high resolution. With expressions of lesser speciﬁcity, we are limited to coarse-grained descriptions whose low resolution reveals only gross features and global organization.
The converse of speciﬁcity is schematicity. Thus relative is schematic with respect to aunt, and rodent with respect to large brown rat. A schematic characterization is instantiated by any number of more speciﬁc ones, each serving to elaborate
1 This fact has not prevented uninformed commentators from claiming that it does. To the extent that conception and visual perception are analogous, I use the term viewing for both (GC: ch. 7). Talmy (1996) refers to them both as “ception”.

its coarse-grained speciﬁcations. Elaborating rodent, in different ways and to different
degrees, are rat, large brown rat, vole, curious mouse, ground squirrel, ferocious porcu-
pine with sharp quills, and so on indeﬁnitely. An elaborative relationship is represented by a solid arrow: A → B. Expressions can often be arranged in elaborative hierarchies, as in (1), where each expression is schematic with respect to those that follow.

(1) (a) rodent → rat → large brown rat → large brown rat with halitosis (b) hot → in the 90s → about 95 degrees → exactly 95.2 degrees

Participating in elaborative relations are both lexical items and novel expressions of any size. In lexicon, such relations constitute taxonomies, i.e. hierarchies of conventionally recognized types, like the one in (2)(a). An elaborative hierarchy containing novel expressions, in this case full sentences, is given in (2)(b).

(2) (a) thing → object → tool → hammer → claw hammer
(b) Something happened. → A person perceived a rodent. → A girl saw a porcupine. → An alert little girl wearing glasses caught a brief glimpse of a ferocious porcupine with sharp quills.

We can make an expression as speciﬁc as we like, for it can be of any length. By making it longer, we can always describe a situation more precisely and in greater detail. There are practical limits, however. Being of ﬁnite length, a particular expression can only be speciﬁc to a certain extent, and only with respect to certain facets of the overall situation. The sentences in (2)(b) are actually rather unnatural because in each case the major elements are all presented at a comparable level of speciﬁcity. More typical are expressions like (3), exhibiting a mixture of schematic and speciﬁc description:2

(3) Somebody saw a ferocious porcupine with sharp quills.

Lexical meanings are likewise speciﬁc in only some respects, schematic in others. For instance, carnivorous and nocturnal are each speciﬁc concerning one aspect of an animal’s behavior but otherwise are quite schematic. The verb crush designates a fairly speciﬁc type of interaction, yet the participants it invokes are only vaguely characterized: as an agent (or energy source) and a deformable object.
Schematization is fundamental to cognition, constantly occurring in every realm of experience. The extraction of a schema is simply the reinforcing of something inherent in multiple experiences, at whatever level of granularity their commonality emerges. A schema should therefore be seen as immanent in its varied instantiations, not as separate and distinct (even if shown individually for analytical purposes). By its very nature, a schema serves a categorizing function: capturing what is common

2 In spontaneous speech, there is a strong tendency for a single clause or a single “intonation unit” to contain just one element introducing a substantial amount of new and important information (Du Bois 1987; Chafe 1994: ch. 5).

to certain previous experiences, it can be applied to any new experience exhibiting the same conﬁguration.
Schemas and elaborative relationships are essential in every aspect of language structure. CG claims that all linguistic generalizations arise via schematization from more speciﬁc structures. In semantics, schemas and categorizing relationships (based on either elaboration or extension) constitute the network representing the senses of a polysemous lexical item (ﬁg. 2.2). In phonology, schemas characterize “natural classes” (like [VOICELESS STOP]) as well as phonotactic patterns (e.g. [CCVC], specifying a permissible type of syllable). The schemas expressing grammatical regularities are symbolic, each consisting of a semantic and a phonological pole. Here too schemas characterize both natural classes (such as verbs) and combinatory patterns (e.g. a passive construction). Finally, as representations of conventional patterns, schemas provide the basis for assessing linguistic well-formedness. An expression is judged well-formed to the extent that it bears relationships of elaboration (rather than extension) to the schemas invoked to categorize it.

3.2 Focusing
Through linguistic expressions, we access particular portions of our conceptual universe. The dimension of construal referred to here as focusing includes the selection of conceptual content for linguistic presentation, as well as its arrangement into what can broadly be described (metaphorically) as foreground vs. background.3
The encyclopedic view of lexical meaning illustrates both aspects of focusing. As part of its conventional value, a lexical item provides direct access to a set of cognitive domains (its matrix) ranked for centrality (likelihood of activation). The domain inventory represents a selection of conceptual content. Also, central domains are foregrounded (in the sense of being more accessible) vis-à-vis peripheral ones. Focusing is further evident in how a lexical item is actually understood in the context of a usage event. Of all the domains in the matrix, only a limited number can be activated on a given occasion (ﬁg. 2.3(b) ). This is a kind of selection. Moreover, the domains selected are activated to varying degrees (ﬁg. 2.8). A high level of activation is a kind of foregrounding.
Focusing is thus a matter of degree. It is also relative to particular purposes, dimensions of structure, and levels of organization. In a complex matrix, a domain in the foreground—by virtue of being central (highly susceptible to activation)—may nonetheless remain in the background (being only weakly activated) on a certain occasion. We saw previously, for the compound lipstick, that the cultural practice of painting lips has a different status at the two levels of structural organization. At the lower level, this domain is not selected at all by stick and is rather peripheral to lip. Yet it is very much in the foreground at the higher level, being strongly evoked by lipstick as a whole.
3 To unify these aspects of focusing, observe that selected content is foregrounded relative to unselected content. Also, certain kinds of prominence (e.g. proﬁling) can be thought of as extreme cases of focusing/foregrounding.

58

PRELIMINARIES

3.2.1 Foreground vs. Background
Many kinds of asymmetries lend themselves to metaphoric description as foreground vs. background. Though distinguishable, they can all be seen as manifesting a very general feature of cognition. Most broadly, they all involve departure from a baseline, the exploitation of previous experience (what has already been established) for the interpretation of subsequent experience.4 A manifestation in perception is the phenomenon known as ﬁgure vs. ground. For instance, a sudden noise stands out as ﬁgure against the ground of silence, or a small, moving cursor against the more stable background on a computer screen. Another manifestation is categorization, which succeeds to the extent that the categorizing structure is recognized within the experience being categorized. The categorizing structure lies in the background, taken for granted as a preestablished basis for assessment, while the target is in the foreground of awareness as the structure being observed and assessed.
We can reasonably speak of background and foreground for any case where one conception precedes and in some way facilitates the emergence of another. In this broad sense, we can say that expressions invoke background knowledge as the basis for their understanding. Such knowledge is presupposed even by a detailed sentence like I want you to put the canned tomatoes on the top shelf of the pantry. Though seemingly explicit, its default interpretation relies, inter alia, on cultural knowledge pertaining to food storage and pantry organization. Without this background knowledge, we might interpret the sentence as indicating that the tomatoes should be removed from the cans before being placed on the shelf, or that the cans should be glued to the face of the shelf instead of being placed on its upper surface. Further in the background, but equally essential, is basic knowledge of our physical world as we experience it (e.g. the experience of reaching upward, or the knowledge that objects will fall to the ground unless supported).
In similar fashion, the source domain of a metaphor has a kind of precedence vis-à-vis the target domain. Usually more concrete or more directly anchored in bodily experience, the source domain provides a conceptual background in terms of which the target domain is viewed and understood. Viewing the target against this background results in a hybrid domain, or blended space (ﬁg. 2.9). We can also say, with equal validity, that the source and target domains jointly constitute the background from which the blended conception emerges. Not only does the blend inherit selected features of both the source and the target, but it is also foregrounded in the sense of being most directly coded linguistically. In The thought just ﬂew right out of my head, it is only a hybrid, bird-like thought that is capable of ﬂight.
Foreground and background have numerous manifestations in discourse (ch. 13). In a narration, for example, static descriptions of the characters and situation serve as the background against which the “story line”—a series of bounded events— stands out as a kind of ﬁgure (Hopper and Thompson 1980). Along another axis, we can distinguish the important content a speaker foregrounds as the actual target of

4 Although terms like “foreground”, “background”, and “baseline” are visual and spatial in origin, the asymmetries in question most likely have some temporal basis in cognitive processing. Even in vision, to perceive something as standing out against a background is to register a contrast presupposing the background as a basis for comparison (FCG1: §3.1).

discussion from subsidiary comments pertaining to its status or assessment. I have in mind examples like (4)(a)–(b), where smaller print represents this communicative backgrounding. Phonologically, it corresponds to the phrases in question being unaccented and lower in pitch.

(4) (a) Victoria would, I think, make a good candidate. (b) Victoria would make a good candidate, I believe. (c) I think Victoria would make a good candidate. (d) I deﬁnitely anticipate that Victoria would make a good candidate. (e) Jason stated that Victoria would make a good candidate.

In sentence (c) we observe that even a “main clause” (i.e. one foregrounded in a structural sense) can be backgrounded in this manner. The main-clause situation stays in the foreground when described in fuller detail, as in (d), or when the opinion is attributed to someone other than the speaker, as in (e).
As discourse unfolds, at each step the current expression is constructed and interpreted against the background of those that have gone before. The prior discourse is a major determinant (along with context, background knowledge, etc.) of what I call the current discourse space (CDS). The CDS is a mental space comprising everything presumed to be shared by the speaker and hearer as the basis for discourse at a given moment. Starting from that basis, each successive utterance updates the CDS in some fashion. In (5), for example, speaker A’s question updates the CDS by introducing a proposition to be considered (‘Victoria will agree to be a candidate’), as well as the expectation that an interlocutor will answer concerning its possible validity. This forms the basis for speaker B’s response, which in turn creates the updated CDS presupposed by C’s continuation.

(5) A: Will Victoria agree to be a candidate? B: She may not. C: But Stephanie will.

As this discourse fragment shows, reference to the CDS is inherent in the meanings of many linguistic elements. A personal pronoun, like she, carries the supposition that its intended referent is established, salient, and uniquely identiﬁable in the CDS (van Hoek 1997). Negation evokes as background the positive conception of what is being denied.5 Speaker B’s use of not is thus interpreted as applying to the previously introduced notion of Victoria agreeing to be a candidate. But indicates a contrast with what has gone before. In using it, speaker C is contrasting Stephanie’s agreement to be a candidate with Victoria’s possible nonagreement, just invoked by B.
The CDS also ﬁgures in various phenomena collectively referred to as information structure. Information is said to be given or new, depending on whether it has already been presented; if given, it can sometimes be left implicit. While agree to be a candidate is new for speaker A, its occurrence in A’s question makes it given

5 I would have no reason to say My car isn’t purple unless the possibility of it being purple had already been mentioned or somehow brought up for consideration.

for B and C, whose responses can therefore be elliptic. When a new proposition is expressed, the portion departing from what was previously established is called the focus. In C’s utterance, Stephanie is the focus, since that is the point of difference between the proposition ‘someone will agree to be a candidate’ (already in the CDS) and ‘Stephanie will agree to be a candidate’ (the contextual interpretation of C’s elliptic statement). Finally, the entire sequence in (5) is construed as pertaining to a particular discourse topic, which—once established as such—need not be explicitly mentioned. From earlier statements, for instance, it might be clear that the entire discourse fragment relates to the next president of the local chapter of the ACLU.

3.2.2 Composition
Let us now turn to focusing that is inherent in the meanings of individual expressions. Most expressions are symbolically complex, being assembled out of smaller symbolic elements (§1.3.1). For example, lipstick has lip and stick as symbolic components. These are component symbolic structures, lipstick as an integrated whole being the composite symbolic structure. Likewise, make and -er are symbolic components of the composite expression maker. A composite structure can itself function as a component structure in an expression of greater symbolic complexity. Lipstick and maker are thus components of the higher-level composite structure lipstick maker. Linguists refer to this hierarchical arrangement as constituency and represent it in tree-like diagrams (e.g. ﬁg. 1.3). One version of such a diagram is given for lipstick maker in ﬁgure 3.1.
As the diagram indicates, the relation between component and composite structures is an instance of background vs. foreground. The relative degree of foregrounding is represented here by the thickness of lines.6 When we use the composite expression lipstick maker, we certainly access the individual meanings of lipstick and maker. We do not evoke them for their own sake, however, but only as a way of “reaching” the novel composite conception, LIPSTICK MAKER. Because the

notions LIPSTICK and MAKER are individually symbolized, and thus facilitate the emergence of the composite conception, they exhibit the conceptual precedence characteristic of background status. Analogously, the conceptual components LIP and STICK are backgrounded in relation to LIPSTICK, as are MAKE and -ER in relation to MAKER. Of course, when there are multiple levels of composition, the highest-level composite structure (in this case LIPSTICK MAKER) is foregrounded with respect to the structures at all lower levels.
Composite expressions exhibit varying degrees of analyzability; that is, they vary in how salient the component structures are in relation to the composite conception, and how strongly they contribute to its emergence. A novel expression, such as lipstick maker, is fully analyzable precisely because it is novel. Since LIPSTICK MAKER is not a prepackaged conceptual unit, it has to be actively constructed on the basis of the individually symbolized notions LIPSTICK and MAKER, which are therefore highly activated and salient within the whole. With a ﬁxed expression, on the other hand, the composite conception does constitute a prepackaged unit, so instead of being newly constructed it need only be activated. No longer is it essential that the symbolic components be recognized and their individual meanings accessed. For ﬁxed expressions, consequently, we can posit degrees of analyzability, depending on how consistently and saliently the component conceptions are accessed along with the composite conception. Maker, for instance, seems more analyzable than lipstick (as shown by the dashed-line boxes in ﬁg. 3.1). The discrepancy is quite evident in cases like complainer, computer, and propeller. We immediately understand complainer as ‘someone who complains’, but computer is not necessarily apprehended as ‘something that computes’, and propel may not be recognized at all in propeller.
How an expression’s composite meaning relates to those of its components (at successive levels of organization) is called its compositional path. Figure 3.1 sketches the compositional path of lipstick maker. An important claim of CG is that an expression’s meaning does not consist of its composite semantic structure alone, but further includes its compositional path, the two standing in a foreground/ background relationship. While the composite conception is primary, it is viewed against the background of the component semantic structures at all lower levels. How strongly a particular component contributes to this secondary dimension of meaning depends on its proximity to the composite structure along the compositional path, as well as the expression’s degree of analyzability at the various levels. LIPSTICK and MAKER are thus quite salient by virtue of proximity—lipstick and maker being immediate constituents of lipstick maker—and also because the composite expression is fully analyzable at that level. MAKE and -ER are less salient within the overall expression since they are backgrounded relative to MAKER, while LIP and STICK are less salient still since lipstick has a lower degree of analyzability.
Why should we deﬁne an expression’s meaning as including its compositional path? For one thing, it just seems right—this is a very real dimension of conceptual organization, and to ignore it is simply pointless. More signiﬁcantly, it helps explain the commonplace observation that no two expressions are exactly the same in meaning. A classic example is pork vs. pig meat. Suppose, for sake of argument, that their composite semantic structures are taken as being identical. They are nevertheless semantically nonequivalent, since they arrive at this composite conception via

62

PRELIMINARIES

different compositional paths: a degenerate path in the case of pork (consisting of just the composite structure, since there are no individually symbolized components); and for pig meat, a path incorporating both PIG and MEAT. The semantic difference, then, is that pig meat evokes the component notions PIG and MEAT more saliently than does pork. Similar examples abound. The word cousin, being unanalyzable, directly invokes a particular kinship conﬁguration, viewed holistically, whereas parent’s sibling’s child arrives at the same conﬁguration step by step, in effect taking us on a tour of the family tree. By the same token, triangle does not have the same meaning as three-angled polygon, irrespective of whether their composite semantic structures are identical. The notions THREE and ANGLE ﬁgure in both expressions but are less salient in triangle, which has a low degree of analyzability. Being individually symbolized, the schematic concept POLYGON is necessarily accessed in three-angled polygon but remains implicit with triangle. It should further be evident that three-angled polygon and three-sided polygon are semantically distinct, despite their referential identity.
By acknowledging the semantic contribution of compositional paths, we can also explain why expressions that are semantically anomalous—having no coherent composite structure—nonetheless seem meaningful. Consider *four-sided triangle. It is semantically anomalous because the component conceptions FOUR-SIDED and TRIANGLE are inconsistent with one another; when we attempt to combine them in the manner speciﬁed by the grammatical construction, the composite semantic structure is either defective or vacuous (depending on how we choose to look at it). The expression is not semantically empty, however: its semantic pole consists of a compositional path with meaningful components arranged in a particular conﬁguration. By virtue of their distinct compositional paths, different anomalous expressions are nonsynonymous. While both *four-sided triangle and *four-angled triangle are incoherent at the composite structure level, they contrast in meaning because their compositional paths incorporate different elements (SIDE, SIDED, and FOURSIDED vs. ANGLE, ANGLED, and FOUR-ANGLED).

3.2.3 Scope
In addition to foregrounding, focusing includes the initial selection of conceptual content for linguistic presentation. One facet of selection is the access an expression affords to a particular set of cognitive domains, in general or on a given occasion. A second facet is the extent of an expression’s “coverage” in the domains accessed: which portions of these domains it actually evokes and utilizes as the basis for its meaning. For each domain in its matrix, an expression has a scope consisting of its coverage in that domain.7
Scope has an evident cognitive basis: there is only so much that we can mentally encompass at any one moment. For example, our visual apparatus limits what we can see at any one time. Experientially, we have a restricted “viewing frame”—the visual ﬁeld—delimiting what we can visually encompass when “looking out” at the world. At any one instant, only a limited portion of our spatial surroundings falls within the
7 Full coverage (where scope and domain are coextensive) is allowed as a special case.

CONSTRUAL

63

scope of vision. We can recognize an analogous delimitation for other domains of experience. For each domain it evokes, an expression’s scope is the conceptual content appearing in the subjective viewing frame inherent in its apprehension.
A scope is always bounded, in the abstract sense of having only limited expanse. Consider a word like glass, which evokes the domain of space for the speciﬁcation of its characteristic shape. Entertaining this shape conception requires a certain spatial expanse, extensive enough to support its manifestation, but this spatial scope does not subsume the entire universe. Similarly, conceptualizing an event—e.g. stumble—requires that we mentally access a span of time long enough to encompass its occurrence, but this temporal scope does not include all of eternity. A term like cousin evokes a nonbasic domain comprising a network of kinship relations. While a kinship network can be extended indeﬁnitely far in any direction, a mere fragment is sufﬁcient to conceptualize the cousin relationship.
Bounding (in this abstract sense) does not imply that a scope’s boundary is objectively discernible. It may only be implicit, imposed by the subjective viewing frame, and not necessarily with any great precision. Indeed, a viewing frame subjectively constant in size may subtend a region of virtually any (objective) size in the domain being viewed. Subjectively, our visual ﬁeld is ﬁxed in size (try expanding it!), yet by adjusting for distance we can greatly modify how much of the surrounding world it delimits; when viewing a distant mountain range, our visual scope is vastly greater than when looking at a painting from close up. This subjective constancy despite variation in scope is quite signiﬁcant linguistically. Because of it, the same expression is often applicable to situations observable at any scale. The description X is close to Y is equally felicitous when applied to the distance between two neurons, two cities, or two galaxies. We can use the word horse not only for a real equine of normal stature but also for a small toy or an enormous sculpture carved from a mountain. It is not just a matter of perceiving their common shape and ignoring the gross disparity in their sizes; in relation to the subjective viewing frame (either the visual ﬁeld or its conceptual analog), they may in fact be of comparable size.
One reason for grouping selection and foregrounding under a common rubric (focusing) is that scope—a matter of selection—can itself be arranged in terms of foreground vs. background. We sometimes need to distinguish between an expression’s maximal scope in some domain, i.e. the full extent of its coverage, and a limited immediate scope, the portion directly relevant for a particular purpose. The immediate scope is thus foregrounded vis-à-vis the maximal scope. Metaphorically, we can describe it as the “onstage region”, the general region of viewing attention.
Consider a word like elbow. Clearly, one domain it selects—quite central in its matrix—is the conception of the human body.8 But it is equally clear that elbow is not characterized directly with respect to the human body as an undifferentiated whole. A body has major parts, including arms, and an elbow is ﬁrst and foremost part of an arm. In conceptualizing an elbow, the conception of an arm in particular is most directly relevant (“onstage”). There is a conceptual hierarchy, such that BODY

PRELIMINARIES

figure 3.2
ﬁgures directly in ARM, which in turn ﬁgures directly in ELBOW, but BODY ﬁgures only indirectly in ELBOW (via ARM). For elbow, then, we can say that BODY functions as maximal scope and ARM as immediate scope. This is shown diagrammatically in ﬁgure 3.2(a).
Distinctions between maximal and immediate scope are quite signiﬁcant in hierarchies consisting of successive whole-part relations. While body-part terms afford the clearest examples, there are similar hierarchies in other domains of experience:
(6) (a) body > arm > hand > ﬁnger > knuckle
(b) body > head > face > eye > pupil
(c) house > door > hinge > screw
(d) car > motor > piston > ring
A striking feature of such hierarchies is that each part functions as immediate scope for the next term in the sequence. The conception of an arm is thus the immediate scope for hand (ﬁg. 3.2(b)), a hand for ﬁnger, and a ﬁnger for knuckle. This type of arrangement is depicted abstractly in ﬁgure 3.3(a), where MS and IS indicate maximal and immediate scope, and a heavy-line box represents the entity designated by each successive expression (its proﬁle). The dotted correspondence lines equate the entity designated by each expression with the immediate scope for the next. As a consequence, each term incorporates in its matrix the essential content of all the terms that precede it in the hierarchy. The result, as shown for Part3 in ﬁgure 3.3(b),

figure 3.3

CONSTRUAL

65

is a layered arrangement of successively embedded scopes. For a given expression, degree of embedding correlates with degree of foregrounding and directness of mental access. Knuckle, for instance, provides direct mental access to FINGER (its immediate scope), which in turn evokes HAND, and so on. The conception of a ﬁnger, a hand, an arm, and the body as a whole all ﬁgure in the meaning of knuckle but lie progressively farther in the background.
This layering has various linguistic manifestations. To take just one, a part can often be labeled by a compound: ﬁngertip, ear lobe, eyeball, toenail, bellybutton, kneecap, thigh bone, door knob, window pane, toilet seat, piston ring, and so on. A noteworthy feature of these compounds is that the component nouns represent adjacent levels in a whole-part hierarchy. More speciﬁcally, the entity designated by the ﬁrst element of the compound functions as immediate scope for the second element, as well as for the composite expression; the referent of toilet, for instance, constitutes the immediate scope for interpreting both seat and toilet seat. Skipping levels usually results in an infelicitous expression. We can therefore speak of a door hinge or a hinge screw, but the same entities could hardly be referred to as a *house hinge or *door screw. And as alternatives to ﬁngernail, eyelash, and shoulder blade, compounds like *armnail, *facelash, and *body blade would simply not work.
The distinction between maximal and immediate scope is not conﬁned to wholepart hierarchies. A rather different example is found in the contrast between a verb designating a bounded event (e.g. examine) and the corresponding progressive (be examining), formed by adding be . . . -ing. The domain of interest is time, indicated in ﬁgure 3.4 by the arrow labeled t.
For the verb itself (V ), there is no reason to distinguish maximal and immediate scope, so the box delimiting the temporal scope in diagram (a) is labeled MS/IS. The heavy line represents the event designated by the verb, viewed in its evolution through time. The entire bounded event, including its endpoints, appears “onstage” within the temporal scope. Diagram (b) shows the effect of adding the progressive be . . . -ing. Its meaning resides in the construal it imposes on the content supplied by the verb. Speciﬁcally, it “zooms in” and imposes a limited immediate scope that excludes the endpoints of the bounded event. The composite expression be Ving therefore has both a maximal and an immediate scope in the temporal domain: its maximal scope encompasses the entire bounded event, of which only some internal portion falls within the immediate scope. Because the immediate scope is foregrounded, only this onstage portion of the overall event stands out as the composite expression’s referent. So in contrast to She examined it, which designates a complete act of examination and speciﬁes its past occurrence, She was examining it merely indicates that such an act was under way.

PRELIMINARIES

3.3 Prominence
Language structure displays numerous kinds of asymmetries that are reasonably considered matters of prominence. The terms prominence and salience (used here interchangeably) are not self-explanatory. Because something can be salient in many different ways, describing it as such is not an adequate characterization but only a starting point for analysis.
What are some dimensions of prominence? Focusing ﬁts comfortably under this rubric, since anything selected is rendered prominent relative to what is unselected, and a foreground is salient relative to its background. Within a category, the prototype has greater prominence than its various extensions.9 Space and vision have a privileged cognitive status vis-à-vis other realms of experience. More generally, an intrinsic disparity in salience seems clearly evident between the members of various oppositions: concrete vs. abstract, real vs. imaginary, explicit vs. implicit, and so on. Whether such asymmetries can all be grouped under a single label is less important than properly distinguishing them and determining which ones ﬁgure in particular phenomena.
Here I concentrate on two particular sorts of prominence: proﬁling and trajector/landmark alignment. Though not equivalent, they are similar in that each involves the focusing of attention (a strong kind of foregrounding). Both constructs are strongly justiﬁed on semantic grounds. They also prove essential in grammatical description.

3.3.1 Proﬁling
As the basis for its meaning, an expression selects a certain body of conceptual content. Let us call this its conceptual base. Construed broadly, an expression’s conceptual base is identiﬁed as its maximal scope in all domains of its matrix (or all domains accessed on a given occasion). Construed more narrowly, its base is identiﬁed as the immediate scope in active domains—that is, the portion put “onstage” and foregrounded as the general locus of viewing attention. Within this onstage region, attention is directed to a particular substructure, called the proﬁle. Thus an expression’s proﬁle stands out as the speciﬁc focus of attention within its immediate scope.10 The proﬁle can also be characterized as what the expression is conceived as designating or referring to within its base (its conceptual referent).
Consider elbow, diagrammed in ﬁgure 3.2(a). With respect to spatial conﬁguration, its maximal scope is the overall shape of the human body.11 Within this, the conception of an arm is put onstage as the immediate scope, or general locus of attention. Within the immediate scope, the expression singles out a certain substructure as
9 Also, in taxonomies a basic level category (e.g. hammer) has greater cognitive salience than either a subordinate category (claw hammer) or a superordinate one (tool) (Taylor 2004: §3.3).
10 The immediate and maximal scopes are not necessarily distinct (see ﬁg. 3.4).
11 Space and spatial conﬁguration are not the only domains in the matrix of elbow, but they are obviously highly central. I emphasize that the semantic descriptions offered here do not purport to be exhaustive but are merely illustrative of the phenomena being discussed.

CONSTRUAL

67

figure 3.5
its proﬁle, or referent. The proﬁle—drawn with heavy lines—is the speciﬁc focus of attention within the onstage region.
If we now compare elbow with hand, sketched in ﬁgure 3.2(b), we see that hand has the same maximal and immediate scopes as elbow but a different proﬁle. In fact, it is quite common that two or more expressions evoke the same conceptual content yet differ in meaning by virtue of proﬁling different substructures within this common base. For instance, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc. all evoke as their base the conception of a seven-day cycle constituting a week, within which they proﬁle different segments. Similarly, as shown in ﬁgure 3.5, the conception of a wheel functions as the base for hub, spoke, and rim, which contrast semantically because they designate different parts. Wheel, of course, proﬁles the whole.
An expression can proﬁle either a thing or a relationship.12 The ones considered so far proﬁle things despite incorporating relationships in their base (notably wholepart relations). Indeed, it is common for an expression to invoke a relationship for its essential conceptual content even though it proﬁles a thing. A good example is a kin term, such as aunt, diagrammed in ﬁgure 3.6. The essential content of this lexeme is the kinship relation between a female and a reference individual, R (the one with respect to whom the person is an aunt). It is this relationship that is critical for characterizing the female in question. Aunt, however, does not proﬁle the relationship but rather the female it serves to identify—its referent is a person, albeit one characterized as a female relative. Note that the proﬁle is not deﬁned as the most important or distinctive content, but rather as the entity an expression designates, i.e. its referent within the content evoked.

figure 3.6
12 This fundamentally important conceptual distinction is discussed in ch. 4. For now I simply note that these terms are deﬁned abstractly (hence things are not limited to physical objects, nor does a relationship necessarily involve multiple participants).

68

PRELIMINARIES

figure 3.7
This distinction—between crucially invoking a relationship and actually proﬁling it—is exempliﬁed in ﬁgure 3.7. All four expressions invoke the conception of a nuclear kin relation (involving one instance of reproduction). Their semantic nonequivalence derives from the different proﬁles they impose on this common base. Parent and child (in the ‘offspring’ sense) are like aunt, in that each proﬁles a thing characterized by its role in the relation; the latter remains unproﬁled, since the referent of parent or child is a person, not a relationship. This relationship is, however, proﬁled by the composite expressions have a parent and have a child. These designate the relationship itself, viewed as a stable situation continuing through time. The semantic contrast between have a parent and have a child resides in their opposite directionality: each portrays the relationship as proceeding from the reference individual (R) of the kin term it incorporates.13
Although have a parent and have a child contrast in directionality, they do not have different proﬁles. An expression’s proﬁle is its referent, and the relationship designated is the same referentially with either direction of mental access. It is, however, common for expressions that proﬁle relationships (like those which proﬁle things) to have the same conceptual base and yet be semantically distinct because they proﬁle different facets of it. For a grammatical example, consider any verb and its corresponding progressive (e.g. examine vs. be examining), diagrammed in ﬁgure 3.4. The verb designates an entire bounded event, while the progressive, without altering the overall content, singles out just an arbitrary internal portion of that event for proﬁling. A lexical example is come vs. arrive, diagrammed in ﬁgure 3.8. As their base, both verbs evoke the conception of a thing (represented as a circle) moving along a spatial path (arrow) to an end location (LOC). Each verb invokes a relationship in which the mover, through time, successively occupies all the positions deﬁning the path. The difference in their meanings is that come proﬁles the full motion event, in which the mover traverses the entire path, whereas arrive designates only the segment in which the mover ﬁnally reaches the goal.
13 The labels tr and lm indicate trajector and landmark, to be discussed shortly. The choice of trajector is responsible for the difference in directionality.

CONSTRUAL

69

figure 3.8
Proﬁling ﬁgures crucially in the pervasive phenomenon known as metonymy. In a narrow sense, we can characterize metonymy as a shift in proﬁle. For example, a customer who says (7)(a) to a waiter is not claiming to be an Italian dessert. While this would be the usual referent of tiramisu, in the restaurant context its proﬁle shifts from the dessert to the person who ordered it. Similarly, in (7)(b) the entity absent from the phone book is not the famous golfer per se but rather his name, address, and telephone number. The proﬁle of Tiger Woods shifts from the person to the associated information (or its printed representation).
(7) (a) I’m the tiramisu.
(b) She couldn’t ﬁnd Tiger Woods in the phone book.
Mediating the shift in proﬁle is a cognitive domain establishing some connection between the two entities: the restaurant scenario of customers placing orders, or else the knowledge of what a phone book is for. More precisely, then, we speak of metonymy when an expression that ordinarily proﬁles one entity is used instead to proﬁle another entity associated with it in some domain. A single expression is susceptible to any number of metonymic extensions, reﬂecting different associations.14 For instance, Miró would ordinarily be understood as referring to a person, as in (8)(a). Since Miró was a famous artist, reference to this person tends to evoke the conception of his works, as well as the more elaborate conceptions of exhibits or books featuring a single artist’s works. Mediated by these domains, Miró is interpreted metonymically in (8)(b)–(d) as designating a work of art, a collection of works, and a book, respectively.
(8) (a) Miró died in 1983.
(b) She bought an original Miró.
(c) Miró is in Gallery B, at the end of this corridor.
(d) Miró is at the bottom of the stack, right under Tamayo.
There are many conventional patterns of metonymy, like the extension from artist to artistic creation. These can be applied productively. If Tiger Woods should give

PRELIMINARIES

up golf for sculpture, we can immediately refer to one of his creations by saying This is a Tiger Woods. Metonymy is a regular source of polysemy, which results when a particular metonymic usage becomes entrenched and conventionalized. Thus church can proﬁle either a building used for religious meetings or a religious organization that meets in such buildings:

(9) (a) They built a new church just out of town. (b) The church he belongs to has very odd beliefs.

And while the usual examples of metonymy pertain to things, we can also observe it in expressions that proﬁle relationships. Consider these two uses of come:

(10) (a) They came all the way from Los Angeles. (b) He came at precisely 7:45 PM.

In (10)(a), come proﬁles the full event of moving along an extended spatial path, as shown in ﬁgure 3.8(a). In (10)(b), however, it designates only the ﬁnal stage of arriving at the goal (making it comparable to arrive in ﬁgure 3.8(b)). Because they proﬁle different substructures within a common base, the two senses are related metonymically, and since they are both conventionally established, come is polysemous.
We have now seen numerous cases where a difference in meaning stems from alternate choices of proﬁle within the same conceptual base. Since the content is effectively equivalent, these semantic contrasts are matters of construal—in particular, the directing of attention to a thing or relationship thereby singled out as an expression’s conceptual referent. Proﬁling is not the only descriptive construct needed pertaining to focus of attention, however. One can easily ﬁnd expressions that are semantically distinct despite having the same conceptual base and proﬁling the same relationship within it. An additional construct is therefore required to properly distinguish the meanings of relational expressions. This is trajector/landmark alignment, another kind of prominence.

3.3.2 Trajector/Landmark Alignment
When a relationship is proﬁled, varying degrees of prominence are conferred on its participants. The most prominent participant, called the trajector (tr), is the entity construed as being located, evaluated, or described. Impressionistically, it can be characterized as the primary focus within the proﬁled relationship. Often some other participant is made prominent as a secondary focus. If so, this is called a landmark (lm). Expressions can have the same content, and proﬁle the same relationship, but differ in meaning because they make different choices of trajector and landmark.15
15 In earlier works, every relational expression was said to have a trajector and a landmark, deﬁned as the entities between which the proﬁled relationship holds (FCG1: §6.3). Under that deﬁnition, the trajector and landmark are not necessarily distinct or individually salient. I now reserve the terms for entities with focal prominence.

CONSTRUAL

71

figure 3.9
The prepositions above and below differ in this manner. They are clearly not synonymous. Where, however, does their contrast in meaning lie? They have the same content: each indicates the relative spatial location of two things, primarily with respect to the vertical axis. Moreover, as shown in ﬁgure 3.9, they also proﬁle the same relationship: referentially, X above Y is the same relationship as Y below X. The semantic contrast can only reside in the degree of prominence conferred on the relational participants. We use X above Y to specify the location of X (the higher participant), and Y below X to locate Y (the lower participant). This makes X and Y their respective trajectors. In each case the other participant functions as a spatial landmark for that purpose. This difference in trajector/landmark alignment, a matter of construal, is solely responsible for above and below being semantically distinct.
If above and below contrast in their choice of trajector, characterized as the participant being located or assessed, the discourse context should sometimes determine which preposition will be used. This prediction is borne out by data like the following:
(11) (a) Where is the lamp?
(i) The lamp (tr) is above the table (lm).
(ii) *The table (tr) is below the lamp (lm).
(b) Where is the table?
(i) The table (tr) is below the lamp (lm).
(ii) *The lamp (tr) is above the table (lm).
The question in (11)(a) makes it clear that the lamp is interpreted as the thing being located. In this context, the answer is felicitous only when the lamp speciﬁes the trajector, as in response (i), not the landmark, as in (ii). In (11)(b), where the table is the entity being located, these judgments are naturally reversed.
Many relational expressions have only a single focal participant. By default, the sole focal participant must be the primary focal participant, which makes it the trajector. With verbs like come and arrive, the mover has this status (ﬁg. 3.8). The relationship they proﬁle is the mover’s translation through space, which clearly involves

72

PRELIMINARIES

a series of locations that the mover successively occupies. But while these successive locations support the conception of spatial movement, they remain in the background rather than standing out as focused elements.16 These verbs thus have a trajector but no landmark.
It is important to realize that a trajector does not have to be a mover (nor is a mover necessarily a trajector). Instead, trajector and landmark are deﬁned in terms of primary and secondary focal prominence, not in terms of any speciﬁc semantic role or conceptual content. The notions are therefore applicable to any kind of cognitive domain. We can see this with the non-motion expressions have a parent and have a child, diagrammed in ﬁgure 3.7. Although they proﬁle the same relationship, which is static and abstract, they are semantically distinct due to their opposite trajector/landmark alignments: have a parent is the description of a child, while have a child describes a parent. Note further that focal prominence is not restricted to things—a relationship can also be put in focus as trajector or landmark. In (12), for instance, before and after proﬁle a relationship of temporal precedence between two events, which are thus the relational participants; but since these events are expressed as ﬁnite clauses, they are themselves relational expressions:

(12) (a) The other guests all left before we arrived. (b) We arrived after the other guests all left.

Once again, as shown in ﬁgure 3.10, before and after designate what is referentially the same relationship. The semantic contrast between them resides in their choice of trajector and landmark, not in content or proﬁling.
As a ﬁnal word on prominence, let us ponder the issue of where to look for it. If a certain element is salient, as either a proﬁle or a focal participant, where exactly does its salience lie? It does not lie in the outside world. If we look at our surroundings, we do not see objects bordered with heavy lines to mark them as proﬁles, nor is something intrinsically a trajector or a landmark. Like other aspects of construal, prominence is a conceptual phenomenon, inhering in our apprehension of the world,

figure 3.10
16 That is, the locations are viewed merely as part of the spatial medium in which the motion occurs. Even the end location, which (as goal) has a certain amount of salience, lacks the focal prominence of a landmark and is often not expressed (They ﬁnally came; We just arrived).

CONSTRUAL

73

not in the world per se.17 However, merely acknowledging its conceptual nature is insufﬁcient. Even at the conceptual level, the objects of our mental universe have no inherent status as proﬁle, trajector, or landmark. These pertain speciﬁcally to the conceptualizations evoked as the meanings of linguistic expressions. How prominent a particular entity is—whether it functions as proﬁle, trajector, landmark, or none of the above—depends on the construal imposed by the linguistic elements employed, in accordance with their conventional semantic values.
Consider The lamp is above the table. The lamp has trajector status only by virtue of how the situation is linguistically expressed. It reﬂects the speaker’s decision to say where the lamp is, and thus to use above, which puts primary focus on the vertically higher participant. Yet nothing forces the speaker to construe and describe the scene this way. In another discourse context (e.g. when discussing a certain table), the speaker might say instead The table is below the lamp. Here the same lamp is only a landmark.
Crucially, these kinds of prominence hold for particular levels of structural organization. As we combine elements to form progressively larger expressions, the composite structure at each level has its own proﬁle; and if that expression proﬁles a relationship, it has its own trajector/landmark alignment. By itself, for instance, table proﬁles a thing, as does the table. But at a higher structural level, above the table proﬁles a spatial relationship. It is only when we reach this level that the table functions as landmark. At a still higher level, where the prepositional phrase modiﬁes a noun, the latter imposes its own proﬁle on the composite expression: the lamp above the table proﬁles the lamp, not the table or the above relationship. This entire nominal can then be used as a subject or object, as in the sentence She detests the lamp above the table. At the sentence level, the proﬁled relationship is detest (not above), the trajector is she, and the landmark is the lamp (not the table). In sum, each structure in a symbolic assembly makes its own assignments of focus, so an entity focused in one structure need not have comparable salience in another.

3.4 Perspective
If conceptualization (metaphorically) is the viewing of a scene, perspective is the viewing arrangement, the most obvious aspect of which is the vantage point assumed. Under the rubric of perspective I also consider dynamicity, pertaining to how a conceptualization unfolds through processing time.
3.4.1 Viewing Arrangement A viewing arrangement is the overall relationship between the “viewers” and the situation being “viewed”. For our purposes, the viewers are conceptualizers who apprehend the meanings of linguistic expressions: the speaker and the hearer.
17 This is not to deny that the world imposes itself in particular ways, thereby constraining and biasing our apprehension of it. Likewise, normal patterns of conceptualization constrain and bias the conceptualizations invoked for linguistic purposes. We nevertheless have enormous conceptual ﬂexibility, and the biases at each level are easily overridden.

PRELIMINARIES

One particular viewing arrangement, common in everyday conversational interactions, arguably has default-case status, being presupposed unless there is reason to assume the contrary. In the default arrangement, the interlocutors are together in a ﬁxed location, from which they observe and describe actual occurrences in the world around them. This default arrangement is tacitly invoked for the kinds of example sentences invented by linguists for basic illustrative purposes, e.g. The lamp is above the table or John kissed Mary.
Precisely because of its default-case status, this arrangement tends to be invisible to us. But though we take it for granted, the default arrangement is an essential part of the conceptual substrate that supports an expression’s meaning and shapes its form. The default arrangement becomes more visible when we consider various departures from it, noting the changes in form and meaning that ensue. Most apparent are expressions that perform an action other than mere description, such as questions and commands:

(13) (a) Is the lamp above the table? (b) Kiss her!

Semantically, these do not report on what is happening but actually comprise a particular kind of speaker-hearer interaction, traditionally called a speech act. This special meaning is signaled by distinct forms (involving word order, intonation, and/or absence of an overt subject). However it is not just the meanings of “special” sentence types like interrogatives and imperatives that incorporate speech acts signaled by their forms. Simple description also represents a kind of speaker-hearer interaction, and basic declarative form (i.e. the absence of special marking) can be seen as a way of indicating it.18 We tend to ignore this speciﬁcation only because it reﬂects the default viewing arrangement, for which zero marking is both natural and iconic (Haiman 1985).
A glance at some other noncanonical viewing circumstances reveals how much of a special case the default arrangement really is. First, a large proportion of what we describe fails to qualify as actual occurrences observed or known to be real. We often say what did not happen, as well as what may or may not occur in the future. We readily invoke hypothetical situations, even some known to be false, and trace their nonfactual development (e.g. If you had asked for directions we wouldn’t have gotten lost). Moreover, we refer to all manner of entities that are virtual, imaginary, blended, abstract, and/or internally contradictory (every ﬂea, Santa Claus, pet rock, compassionate conservative, four-sided triangle, the square root of minus one, the last digit in the decimal expansion of pi).
Rather different are departures from the default arrangement involving the relative position of the viewers. For example, instead of occupying a ﬁxed location, the viewer is often conceived as being in motion. In (14)(a), through this valley describes the path of the viewer’s motion, which otherwise remains implicit. In (14)(b), it is

18 Simple description is usually (but misleadingly) called assertion. Note that questioning, ordering, and assertion are only the prototypical values of the interrogative, imperative, and declarative sentence types (viewed as forms). The same forms can be used for other speech acts, and the same speech acts can be expressed in other ways. (See §13.2.3.)

only the presupposed journey that makes it coherent to characterize the length of a nap by means of a spatial distance.

(14) (a) It’s pretty through this valley. (b) She’s been asleep for 30 miles. (c) The trees are rushing past at 90 miles per hour. (d) The forest is getting thicker.

Movement by the viewer can also engender a perception of change which, though virtual in nature, is described as if it were actual. While it is possible in (14)(c) that the trees actually are in motion, the more likely interpretation is that a moving viewer (perhaps riding in a train) is describing the visual impression obtained by imagining the default arrangement where the viewer is static. Similarly, the more likely interpretation of (14)(d) does not involve any actual change in the forest. Rather, movement through the forest brings the viewer into contact with different portions of it, which—when ﬁctively construed as the same entity—are seen as increasing in density. Although these expressions make no explicit reference to the viewer’s motion, it is nonetheless part of their conceptual substrate, in no small measure being responsible for their conceptual coherence as well as their form.
Another possibility is for the interlocutors to be separated in space or time. Consider the banal statement It’s warm here. In a face-to-face conversation, here refers to the area where both the speaker and the hearer are located. But in the context of a long-distance phone call, the proximate region it designates is deﬁned in relation to the speaker alone: It’s warm here, but it must be cold where you are. Illustrating displacement in time is the recorded message one hears when making a phone call and reaching an answering machine. This message might begin with the statement I’m not here right now, which is contradictory presuming the default viewing arrangement (by deﬁnition, where I am right now is here). In recording the message, however, the speaker interprets right now as referring to the later time when a caller will hear it, and at that time the speaker will not be at home (here). What makes the message coherent and easy to understand is our apprehension of the overall communicative situation, part of the tacit conceptual substrate. An extreme example of spatiotemporal displacement is a sign or warning label, e.g. Shake well before using (Sadock 1974). Here the expressive medium is writing rather than speech. Moreover, the writer is not a particular person but a generalized voice of authority (perhaps the manufacturer), the reader is whoever should happen to use the product, and a usage event occurs whenever and wherever the label is read. The speciﬁc time and place of writing are unknown and irrelevant.
One component of the viewing arrangement is a presupposed vantage point. In the default arrangement, the vantage point is the actual location of the speaker and hearer. The same objective situation can be observed and described from any number of different vantage points, resulting in different construals which may have overt consequences. Many expressions undeniably invoke a vantage point as part of their meaning (arguably, all expressions do). In one of their basic uses, for example, in front of and behind rely on vantage point to specify the trajector’s location

76

vis-à-vis the landmark. This is sketched in ﬁgure 3.11, where VP labels the vantage point and a dashed arrow indicates the viewer’s line of sight. In both cases, one focal participant intervenes in the line of sight leading from the vantage point to the other participant. As in previous examples, the semantic contrast resides in choice of trajector and landmark, there being no signiﬁcant difference in content or proﬁling.
If we imagine a scene with a large rock and a tree, how we code it linguistically depends on the vantage point we assume. Let us suppose that the rock, tree, and vantage point are roughly in alignment, as indicated in (15)(a). Then, if the vantage point is such that the rock intervenes in the line of sight (VP1), we can happily use either sentence in (15)(b). If the vantage point is such that the tree intervenes (VP2), the sentences in (15)(c) are appropriate instead.
(15) (a) VP1 ---> (rock)———(tree) <--- VP2 (b) VP1: The rock (tr) is in front of the tree (lm). The tree (tr) is behind the rock (lm). (c) VP2: The tree (tr) is in front of the rock (lm). The rock (tr) is behind the tree (lm).
Of course, the vantage point assumed for linguistic purposes need not be the speaker’s actual location. We can easily adopt a ﬁctive vantage point and imagine what the scene would look like from there. The following would thus be appropriate and readily understood when uttered at VP1:
(16) VP1: If you were standing over there [at VP2], the tree would be in front of the rock.
This capacity to ﬁctively adopt or at least accommodate a nonactual vantage point enables us to describe a situation from the perspective of the hearer or some other individual.
While the term suggests space and vision, vantage point is a useful descriptive construct for other domains as well, notably time. As shown in ﬁgure 3.12, the phrase next year evokes as its base the conception of a series of years, within which it proﬁles the year immediately following the one containing the temporal vantage point. In the default situation, this vantage point is equated with the time of speaking, as in (17)(a).
(17) (a) Next year will be full of surprises.
(b) Joe believed that next year would be full of surprises.

CONSTRUAL

77

figure 3.12
But here too we can easily adopt a vantage point other than the one deﬁned by the speech event. In (17)(b), next year invokes a temporal vantage point identiﬁed as the time of the main-clause occurrence: the year in question is the one immediately following the year when Joe entertained his belief (not the year when the sentence is produced).
Closely related to vantage point is a subtle but important aspect of construal known in CG as subjectivity vs. objectivity. Though quite general in application, it is best introduced with reference to visual perception. Imagine yourself in the audience of a theater, watching a gripping play. All your attention is directed at the stage, and is focused more speciﬁcally on the actor presently speaking. Being totally absorbed in the play, you have hardly any awareness of yourself or your own immediate circumstances. This viewing arrangement therefore maximizes the asymmetry between the viewer and what is viewed, also called the subject and object of perception. In this polarized arrangement, where the asymmetry in viewing role is maximized, the viewing subject is said to be construed with maximal subjectivity and the object with maximal objectivity. Subjective construal is characteristic of the viewer’s role as such—as an offstage locus of perceptual experience that is not itself perceived. Conversely, objective construal characterizes the onstage focus of attention, which (at least in that capacity) does not engage in viewing. By virtue of being attended to, an entity construed objectively is clearly more prominent than it is when construed subjectively.19
For linguistic purposes, we are interested in the general conceptual analog of this perceptual asymmetry. The subjects of conception are the speaker and hearer, who apprehend the meanings of expressions. When they function exclusively in this capacity, as a tacit conceptualizing presence that is not itself conceived, they are construed with maximal subjectivity. At the opposite extreme, construed with maximal objectivity, is the focused object of attention: the entity an expression puts onstage and proﬁles. Objective construal thus correlates with proﬁling and explicit mention, and subjective construal with an implicit locus of consciousness. Being implicit is not the same as being absent, however. The conceptualization constituting an expression’s meaning extends beyond its onstage content (which does not exist in isolation), further encompassing its mode of apprehension by the offstage conceptualizers in the context of the overall viewing arrangement.
19 When I am wearing my glasses, for instance, they are essentially part of my visual system, hence subjectively construed and nonsalient. They help shape my visual experience, but barely, if at all, do I see the glasses themselves. They become salient, however, when I construe them objectively by taking them off and looking at them.

78

PRELIMINARIES

In their tacit role as subjects of conception, the speaker and hearer are always part of the conceptual substrate supporting an expression’s meaning.20 If that is their only role, they are always implicit and construed with maximal subjectivity. To varying degrees, however, they can themselves function as objects of conception, in which case they are more salient by virtue of being construed more objectively. The extreme is to put them onstage as the focus of attention: with the ﬁrst- and second-person pronouns (I, you, we, and their variants), the speaker and hearer are proﬁled, explicitly mentioned, and objectively construed. There are also intermediate possibilities. In (15), the speaker and hearer are not merely the subjects of conception, they are also the viewers whose vantage point and line of sight are invoked by in front of and behind (ﬁg. 3.11). To this extent they ﬁgure in the scene described, so their role is not wholly subjective. But neither is it fully objective, for even in this additional viewing capacity they are offstage, unproﬁled, and implicit.
The term ground is used for the speaker and hearer, the speech event in which they participate, and their immediate circumstances (e.g. the time and place of speaking). As the “platform” for apprehending the content evoked, the ground enters into the meaning of every expression, even when construed with maximal subjectivity. Usually, though, facets of the ground are themselves evoked as part of that content, so that to some degree they function as objects of conception. Quite often they are proﬁled; since we are naturally concerned with ourselves and our own circumstances, words like I, you, here, and now are highly frequent. It may however be more typical for facets of the ground to be offstage and construed with only minimal objectivity. They tend to function as implicit points of reference for specifying the location of more objectively conceived entities vis-à-vis the ground. We have already seen this in (15) and (17)(a): just as the place of speaking is tacitly invoked as the spatial vantage point for in front of and behind, so the time of speaking functions implicitly as a temporal point of reference for next year.
The ground’s role as tacit point of reference is in fact ubiquitous. Even when implicit and construed with a substantial degree of subjectivity, the ground functions in this capacity for every full nominal and every ﬁnite clause (ch. 9). For example, tense is usually reckoned from the ground: was, is, and will be are past, present, and future with respect to the time of speaking. In the nominal sphere, a comparable parameter is deﬁniteness, as in the contrast between a rock (indeﬁnite) and the rock (deﬁnite). Deﬁniteness relates to the speaker and hearer, for it depends on whether the nominal referent is uniquely apparent to both interlocutors in the current discourse context. Observe that the grammaticized markers for tense and deﬁniteness invoke some facet of the ground but do not mention it explicitly: now is not incorporated in the tense markers (e.g. -ed, -s, will), nor do markers of deﬁniteness (like a and the) incorporate the pronouns I and you.

20 If we view an expression abstractly, independent of speciﬁc usage events, the speaker’s and hearer’s subjective role is just that—a role to be instantiated by particular individuals whenever the expression is actually used.

3.4.2 The Temporal Dimension
Conceptualization is inherently dynamic—not something that statically exists, but rather something that happens. It resides in mental processing (or neurological activity) and therefore occurs through time. When time is viewed in this capacity, as the medium of conception, it is referred to as processing time. Every conceptualization requires some span of processing time for its occurrence. Even one that we experience as instantaneous (e.g. feeling the prick of a pin) has a duration and a course of development when examined on a small enough scale. As an aspect of construal, dynamicity pertains to how a conceptualization develops and unfolds through processing time, especially on larger time scales where its consequences are introspectively accessible.21
Processing time has to be distinguished from conceived time—that is, time as an object of conception. Time is construed most objectively when a span of time is proﬁled, for instance by expressions like moment, period, week, and next year (ﬁg. 3.12). Time is also construed objectively, though not as the focus of attention, when it functions as the cognitive domain in which a proﬁled relationship is manifested, as with before and after (ﬁg. 3.10). It ﬁgures as well in the conception of any event, since events occur through time. The verb enter, for example, designates a relationship in space (ﬁg. 2.1), but the change in spatial conﬁguration constituting the proﬁled event can only be implemented along the temporal axis. Conceived and processing time can be hard to disentangle, if only because the conceptualization of time necessarily occurs through time. Still, for semantic purposes they have to be clearly separated. In understanding a sentence like (18), we require only a brief interval of processing time (perhaps a second) to scan through a distinct and much longer interval of conceived time (perhaps an hour).
(18) The long procession slowly entered the city.
There is a natural tendency for conceived time and processing time to be coaligned, such that the order in which events are conceived as occurring dovetails with the order in which they are conceptualized and described. This temporal iconicity is well known from examples like (19)(a), which would normally be interpreted as indicating that the resignation preceded the marriage and that the marriage preceded the birth, although the sentence does not actually say this.
(19) (a) I quit my job, got married, and had a baby.
(b) I had a baby, got married, and quit my job—in reverse order, of course.
Such iconicity is only a tendency, however. We can mentally access events and describe them linguistically in a sequence that diverges from their order of occurrence or even runs directly counter to it. Thus a sentence like (19)(b) could perfectly

21 This dynamic view of conceptualization ﬁts well with a psychological theory of meaning based on mental simulation (Barsalou 1999).

80

PRELIMINARIES

well be used in the proper context (e.g. in response to the question What are the most important things that happened to you last year?).
Temporal iconicity of the sort observed in (19)(a) is represented in ﬁgure 3.13(a). The upper and lower arrows respectively indicate conceived time (t) and processing time (T). E1, E2, and E3 are three events (e.g. quitting a job, getting married, and having a baby). A, B, and C stand for the conceptualization of each event as it occurs in constructing or understanding a linguistic expression describing it, while the corresponding lower-case letters stand for those expressions themselves (e.g. I quit my job, [I] got married, and [I] had a baby). When a sentence like (19)(a) is uttered, the component expressions are spoken in a certain order (a > b > c), which either reﬂects or induces an ordering of the conceptualizations they symbolize (A > B > C). Both expression and conception occur (and are coaligned) through processing time (T). Iconicity obtains when the events thus conceptualized are further conceived as occurring in that same order (E1 > E2 > E3) through conceived time (t). There is full harmonization in the sequencing of events, event conceptions, and event descriptions.
Diagrammed in ﬁgure 3.13(b) is the noniconic alignment of a sentence like (19)(b). As always, the sequence in which the component expressions occur (a > b > c) correlates with an ordering of the conceptualizations they symbolize (A > B > C). Here, though, this coalignment at the two poles in processing time does not extend to corresponding events in conceived time. Via the linguistic expression, these events are mentally accessed in the order E3 > E2 > E1, while they are conceived as actually occurring in the opposite order, E1 > E2 > E3. We can certainly accomplish this, conceptually and linguistically, but it does carry a processing cost. The need for extra processing effort is signaled by the appendage in (19)(b): in reverse order, of course. This directs the listener to reconceptualize the events described, by mentally running through them again, but in a sequence directly counter to the order of their initial presentation. Only through such backtracking can the listener arrive at a proper apprehension of their actual temporal sequencing.
The order of presentation is conceptually and semantically consequential even when event order is not a factor. A case in point is the semantic effect of preposing a locative expression, as illustrated by the following contrast:

(20) (a) A dead rat lay in the middle of the kitchen ﬂoor. (b) In the middle of the kitchen ﬂoor lay a dead rat.

figure 3.13

CONSTRUAL

81

Despite having the same elements, the sentences have different meanings. Their semantic contrast does not reside in the objective situation described but in how it is mentally accessed. The atypical word order in (20)(b) accommodates the general discourse tendency for given information to precede new information, while also allowing the introduction of a new participant as grammatical subject (cf. Birner 1994). The sentence ﬁrst directs attention to an already accessible location, and then brings a new participant (a dead rat) into the discourse by establishing it in that location. Evidence that the construction in (20)(b) has this special semantic value comes from the infelicity of expressions whose information structure conﬂicts with it.22 For instance, (21)(b) is awkward because the subject refers to the speaker, who is always taken as given, as already established in the discourse. Conversely, (21)(c) is infelicitous because the preposed locative represents new information. Compare this with (21)(d), where the garage is mentioned in the ﬁrst conjunct and is therefore given for purposes of the second.

(21) (a) I lay in the middle of the kitchen ﬂoor. (b) ?*In the middle of the kitchen ﬂoor lay I. (c) ?*In a garage sat an old truck. (d) There was a garage behind the house, and in this garage sat an old truck.

Order of presentation also has an evident semantic impact in examples like these:

(22) (a) Your camera is upstairs, in the bedroom, in the closet, on the shelf. (b) Your camera is on the shelf, in the closet, in the bedroom, upstairs.

Once again, the two sentences are semantically distinct, even though they contain the same elements and describe the same objective situation. They represent two variants of the “nested locative” construction (GC: 60–61), which specify the subject’s location through a series of locative expressions pinning it down to successively nested spatial areas. The difference is that the ﬁrst variant “zooms in” from the largest area to successively smaller ones, whereas the second variant starts from the smallest area and “zooms out”. While the two sentences succeed in evoking the same overall spatial conﬁguration, they build up to it in different ways, thereby providing very different conceptual experiences. They contrast semantically precisely because each conceptualization has its own time course, unfolding in a particular way through processing time.
The words of an expression occur in a certain temporal sequence, which linguists (unwittingly using spatial metaphor) refer to as “linear order”. This temporal sequencing deﬁnes one salient path of access to the conceptions symbolized. Since

22 Many scholars would say that the contrast in (20) is not one of semantics but rather of pragmatics. I would argue, however, that information structure is conceptual in nature, being special only in that the relevant cognitive domain is the apprehension of the discourse itself.

82

PRELIMINARIES

we necessarily encounter these words sequentially, in either speaking or understanding, linear order always has some effect on meaning—a difference in word order always implies a semantic contrast (though in practical terms it may be slight or even negligible). But linear order is not the only factor inﬂuencing the sequence of mental access, nor is the cognitive processing of a sentence limited to a single “left-to-right” pass through it. Processing occurs simultaneously in multiple structural dimensions, at different levels of organization, and on vastly different time scales. Even as we are attending to individual words, we must also be making more global projections at various syntactic and even discourse levels. Much of the relevant conceptual structure is not expressed at all by overt elements, which are merely prompts for the requisite meaning construction. And those notions which are expressed can be reaccessed and reconceptualized as needed, through backtracking (as in (19)(b)).
Sequencing at the conceptual level is thus not always driven by the order of overt elements in speech. We can see this from pairs of examples like (23), which describe the same spatial conﬁguration but have contrasting meanings nonetheless:

(23) (a) The hill gently rises from the bank of the river. (b) The hill gently falls to the bank of the river.

The difference lies in the direction of mental scanning. The conceptualizer, in building up to a full conception of the proﬁled relationship, constructs an image of the hill by tracing a mental path along it in either an upward or a downward direction. However, the direction of scanning is not determined by the order in which the words occur, but rather by their meanings: rises from induces upward mental scanning, and falls to, downward scanning. Note further that rise and fall, whose basic senses pertain to spatial motion, are used here to describe a situation that objectively is totally static. While motion is indeed involved, it is subjectively construed. In the case of objectively construed motion (e.g. It fell), an onstage entity moves along a spatial path through conceived time. By contrast, the mover in (23) is the offstage conceptualizer, who traces a mental path in space through processing time.
Mental scanning is not restricted to space. Directed scanning through a nonspatial domain is pivotal to the meaning of many expressions and is often reﬂected in their form. Commonly it consists of running through a set of conceived alternatives arranged in a certain order. Here are a few examples:

(24) (a) Gestation period varies greatly from one species to the next. (b) I’ll never get into a size 8, and a size 9 is probably still too small. (c) Don’t mention calculus—elementary algebra is already too advanced for him.

In (24)(a), the alternatives are an imagined set of species, the variation in gestation period being observed as we move subjectively from one . . . to the next. In (24)(b), we scan in a positive direction along a scale of possible sizes. This mental scanning is signaled by still, which normally indicates persistence in time (e.g. Is she still asleep?). It has the same value here, apart from being construed subjectively. It does

CONSTRUAL

83

not describe the insufﬁcient size as persisting through conceived time, but through processing time, as the conceptualizer scans through a range of alternative sizes. The temporal persistence is subjectively construed by virtue of inhering in the conceptualizing activity itself. Similarly, in (24)(c) the conceptualizer moves subjectively along a scale in which mathematical subjects are ranked for difﬁculty. The word already indicates that the property of being too advanced is encountered sooner than expected (cf. Are you done already?). However, this imagined encounter only occurs in processing time: in scanning through the list of subjects, the conceptualizer comes upon it at the level of elementary algebra, well before reaching calculus.
Mental scanning can follow a path that is either continuous or discrete. In (23), the conceptualizer traces a continuous path along the hill’s expanse in building up a conception of its overall conﬁguration. By contrast, the scanning in (24) follows a path consisting of discrete steps (species, sizes, or mathematical subjects), but here too the sequenced mental access is a means of building up to an overall conception of some complexity. These are two forms of a general process I refer to as summary scanning. As we scan through a complex scene, successively attending to various facets of it, the elements apprehended at each stage are summed, or superimposed. In this way a detailed conception is progressively built up, becoming active and available as a simultaneously accessible whole for a certain span of processing time.23
Of considerable grammatical importance is a particular type of scanning called a reference point relationship. The term is best reserved for cases where the mental path is discrete, each element accessed is individually salient, and the reason for scanning along this path is primarily to ﬁnd or identify the element ultimately arrived at. We can best appreciate this from a perceptual example. We often direct attention to a perceptually salient entity as a point of reference to help ﬁnd some other entity, which would otherwise be hard to locate. In (25)(a), for instance, the speaker wants to direct the hearer’s attention to the duck, but from a distance the boat is easier to pick out. Once the hearer has located the boat, the duck can be found by searching in its vicinity.

(25) (a) Do you see that boat out there in the lake? There’s a duck swimming right next to it. (b) Do you remember that surgeon we met at the party? His wife just ﬁled for divorce.

This perceptual phenomenon has a general conceptual analog, exempliﬁed in (25)(b). The speaker ﬁrst directs attention to one conceived entity (the surgeon) for the speciﬁc purpose of locating another that is mentally accessible in relation to it (the surgeon’s wife).
Clearly, then, we have the ability to invoke the conception of one entity in order to establish “mental contact” with another. The entity ﬁrst invoked is called a reference point, and one accessed via a reference point is referred to as a target. A particular reference point affords potential access to many different targets. Collectively, this set

23 To some extent, this kind of summation is always going on as we process words in their sequence of occurrence. The examples show it to be a general conceptual phenomenon independent of word order. In ch. 4 I discuss the grammatical relevance of summary scanning.

84

PRELIMINARIES

figure 3.14
of potential targets constitute the reference point’s dominion. Thus a reference point relationship comprises the elements depicted in ﬁgure 3.14. In the case of (25)(a), the reference point is the boat, the target is the duck, and the dominion is everything—including the duck—in the boat’s vicinity. In (25)(b), the reference point is the surgeon, his wife is the target, and the dominion is anything readily associated with (hence mentally accessible via) the surgeon.
It is no accident that the target in (25)(b), his wife, contains a possessor pronoun referring back to the reference point. There is good evidence that a reference point relationship represents the essential meaning of a basic possessive construction (GC: ch. 6). Here I offer just two brief observations. First, the characterization is independent of any speciﬁc conceptual content. Thus it has the abstractness and ﬂexibility needed to accommodate the full range of possessive expressions, e.g. all those in (26)(a).24
(26) (a) the boy’s shoe; Jeff’s uncle; the cat’s paw; their lice; the baby’s diaper; my train; Sally’s job; our problem; her enthusiasm; its location; your candidate; the city’s destruction
(b) *the shoe’s boy; *the paw’s cat; *the diaper’s baby; * the destruction’s city
Second, the characterization explains why it is usually infelicitous to reverse the choice of possessor and possessed, as seen in (26)(b). This irreversibility reﬂects the intrinsic asymmetry of a reference point relationship, where conceiving of one entity makes it possible to mentally access another. As a schematic and fully general description, it is thus proposed that a possessor functions as a reference point, and the possessed as its target.
A reference point relationship is often conﬂated with speciﬁc conceptual content, such as spatial proximity in (25)(a). Still, its essential semantic import resides in the very act of mental scanning: evoking ﬁrst the reference point and then a target it renders accessible. It is thus inherently and quintessentially dynamic, for how it unfolds through processing time actually constitutes its value. As shown by the arrows in ﬁgure 3.14, a reference point relation involves two phases of focused awareness, their temporal sequence deﬁning its directionality and intrinsic asymmetry. The ﬁrst phase consists of
24 As a general description, the notion ‘ownership’ is too narrow, applying only to the ﬁrst example cited. While ‘ownership’ (along with ‘kinship’ and ‘whole-part’) does appear to be prototypical for possessive constructions, a schematic characterization valid for all instances has to be devoid of speciﬁc content.

85

mentally accessing the reference point, which is thereby placed in focus. Its activation creates the conditions for accessing elements of the reference point’s dominion, one of which is focused as the target. As focus shifts to the target, the reference point—having served its purpose—fades into the background. Hence the reference point and target are both salient, each at a certain stage of processing.
Once focused, of course, the target provides access to its own dominion and may then be invoked as reference point to reach another target. In this way we often scan along a chain of successive reference points. One such case is a chain of possessives, e.g. Harry’s cousin’s lawyer’s therapist. Another is the chain of successive locations speciﬁed in the nested locative construction, as in (22)(a): upstairs, in the bedroom, in the closet, on the shelf. Once a particular location is singled out, it affords ready access to any smaller location within it, one of which is put in focus as the target and the next locative reference point.

3.5 Evidence for Semantic Claims
A conceptual semantics lets us make sense of how language makes sense. In and of itself, however, a conceptualist stance does not make semantic description any easier (quite the contrary). Nor does it offer any assurance that we are describing meanings in a principled and appropriate manner. How can we tell whether a proposed description has any validity?
We cannot just rely on intuition or introspection. A conceptual view of meaning does not imply that semantic structure is directly accessible to introspective awareness: engaging in conceptualization is not the same as knowing how it works, any more than seeing is knowing how vision works. We apprehend meanings (i.e. we understand the expressions we use), but this is quite different from subjecting them to explicit analysis. Indeed, at the level of conscious analysis we are generally quite oblivious to construal—both the fact that we construe the content evoked and also the speciﬁc ways in which we do so. In normal, unreﬂective language use our primary interest lies in what is being said, not the underlying mechanisms. These mechanisms are in any case inaccessible to conscious awareness, just as the mechanisms of vision are themselves invisible to us.
It is only through careful linguistic analysis that we can arrive at a principled and revealing characterization of semantic structure. The semantic descriptions proposed in CG utilize a particular set of theoretical constructs—notions like domain, proﬁle, trajector, vantage point, scanning, mental space, immediate scope, and reference point relation. These constructs have all been adopted on the basis of substantial and varied empirical evidence. The general strategy employed is to seek converging evidence from each of three general sources: (i) what we know about cognition (independently of language), (ii) what is needed for viable semantic descriptions, and (iii) whether the constructs support an optimal account of grammar.
With respect to (i), the descriptive constructs proposed in CG are all based on well-known or easily demonstrated cognitive phenomena. Many have direct analogs in vision, although they clearly extend to other aspects of cognition. For example, the focusing of attention is quite apparent in both visual and auditory perception, as

well as nonlinguistic thought. There is no question that we apprehend our surroundings from a particular vantage point and have the ability to mentally adopt a vantage point other than our actual one. In the same way that we can visually scan through a scene, we can mentally run through a range of options. The use of reference points is evident in perception and fundamental to conception in general. Hence the descriptive constructs adopted in CG are not in any way exotic or even problematic from the psychological standpoint. In fact, it would be peculiar to suppose that such phenomena lack an important role in linguistic meaning.
As for (ii), the primary means of justifying constructs empirically is by showing that they are needed for adequate semantic descriptions. For instance, proﬁling is supported by the need to distinguish expressions that differ in meaning despite evoking the same content (e.g. parent vs. child, come vs. arrive, examine vs. be examining). Likewise, trajector/landmark alignment is supported by the need to distinguish semantically nonequivalent expressions that are the same in both content and proﬁling (e.g. before vs. after, precede vs. follow, have a parent vs. have a child). I would argue that the constructs adopted in CG are quite successful in allowing principled representations of the similarities and differences among expressions with comparable content. Moreover, the same, limited set of constructs prove systematically applicable to an extremely broad array of diverse data.
A ﬁnal source of evidence is (iii), whether the constructs adopted support an optimal account of grammar. In later chapters, I show that the constructs of CG score very highly on this count. For example, proﬁling turns out to be crucial for the characterization of basic grammatical classes. Subject and object are deﬁned in terms of trajector/landmark alignment. The constructs also work well in the description of particular grammatical constructions. We have already noted the role of immediate scope in both the progressive construction (ﬁg. 3.4) and whole-part compounding (e.g. eyelash vs. *facelash, shoulder blade vs. *body blade).
Let us now turn from general constructs to the characterization of particular expressions. How can a proposed semantic description be supported empirically? At least at this level, I suggest that native speaker intuition is not entirely irrelevant. We obviously cannot expect naive speakers to produce semantic descriptions or even to articulate the subtle differences between expressions. Still, speakers do have semantic intuitions that bear on descriptive issues and are probably no less reliable (or no more unreliable) than the grammaticality judgments traditionally employed in formal syntax. With large samples and appropriate statistical techniques, for example, speaker judgments could help determine whether ring ‘circular piece of jewelry’ and ring ‘arena’ represent alternate senses of a polysemous lexical item (as opposed to being unrelated homonyms), or whether computer is in fact more analyzable than propeller. Speaker reactions to more elaborate semantic descriptions may also be pertinent. If a proposed characterization strikes speakers as being intuitively natural and revealing, we can at least feel encouraged and prefer this to the opposite judgment.25

25 Positive reactions of this sort are quite common in cognitive linguistics and, ironically, are one reason it tends to be underappreciated. Semantic descriptions achieved through considerable effort and ingenuity are often so natural and revelatory that they give the impression of having been obvious all along, so nothing seems to have been accomplished.

Evidence can sometimes be sought by looking at other languages (Haiman 1978). Consider the issue of whether the if occurring in conditional clauses (If it rains we’ll stay home) and the if occurring in interrogative clauses (I wonder if it will rain) are semantically related. Supporting a claim of polysemy is the fact that a single form is used in both ways in numerous other languages (e.g. French). Were this merely a case of accidental homonymy, it should not be prevalent cross-linguistically. Another source of evidence is language change. It is known, for example, that particular kinds of grammatical markers evolve historically from particular kinds of lexical items. Such paths of grammaticalization can tell us something about the meanings of the elements involved. One common path is for a lexical verb like have, used for possession (She has a cat), to develop into an auxiliary verb marking perfect aspect (She has ﬁnished). This provides a measure of corroboration for the proposal that possessive constructions are based on reference point relations. It is generally accepted that perfect constructions involve a reference point in time. For instance, He had left by 3 PM takes 3 pm as a temporal reference point and portrays the leaving as being accomplished prior to it. This path of grammaticalization is most easily analyzed if a possessive verb is itself characterized in terms of a reference point relationship.
More consistently available as empirical evidence are the predictions a semantic description lets us make. Implicit in any such description are expectations that certain kinds of expressions ought to be semantically well-formed and others judged anomalous. Suppose it is claimed that in (27)(a) the inanimate subject is construed metaphorically in terms of the human body. The choice among sit, stand, and lie should thus depend on whether—by analogy to a person assuming these postures— the subject’s referent is relatively compact (as in sitting) or whether it is saliently extended along the vertical or horizontal axis.26

(27) (a) The clock is {sitting/standing/lying} on the table. (b) The {vase/?pen/?football/?*watermelon/*mat/*peach} is standing on the table.

This prediction is in fact borne out, as seen from data like (27)(b). Stand is unproblematic with vase, as such objects are commonly tall and thin. Pen and football are questionable, since the vertical orientation suggested by stand is hard to achieve in practice. They are acceptable, however, if we imagine that the pen is standing on end (possible with certain pens) or that the football is on a kicking tee. Because it has rounded ends, a watermelon can only lie on a table unless we concoct a bizarre context (e.g. it might be impaled on a spike). Neither a mat nor a peach has the right shape for a verb demanding salient vertical extension. Of course, encyclopedic knowledge tells us that mats are sometimes rolled up, and a rolled-up mat could well be stood on end; under this interpretation we can perfectly well describe it as standing. On the other hand, a peach is roughly spherical, with no conspicuously long dimension, so regardless of orientation it can only sit.
Other predictions pertain to the discourse contexts in which an expression can occur. Recall, for instance, that the characterization of trajector/landmark alignment,

26 Matters are slightly more complex in that sit also functions as the general term, i.e. it has a schematic sense that abstracts away from the differences in posture, making it broadly applicable.

and the description of above and below as contrasting in that regard, predicted the distribution in (11): a sentence like The lamp is above the table is felicitous in response to the question Where is the lamp?, and The table is below the lamp in response to Where is the table?, but not conversely. Recall as well the discourse-based characterization of sentences like (20)(b), In the middle of the kitchen ﬂoor lay a dead rat. The description correctly predicts that such expressions will be infelicitous if the postposed subject represents given information (*In the middle of the kitchen ﬂoor lay I ), or if the preposed locative represents new information (?*In a garage sat an old truck).
We can sometimes make predictions to be tested experimentally. I would claim, for example, that the semantic contrast between (28)(a) and (28)(b) resides in the direction of summary scanning. The conceptualizer builds up to a full conception of the scar’s conﬁguration by scanning mentally along its extension in one direction or the other, as speciﬁed by the from- and to-phrases. Moreover, the order of words in speech induces us to access the conceptions they symbolize in the corresponding order. In (28)(a)–(b), these two conceptual orderings are in alignment: we ﬁrst encounter the from-phrase, specifying where the mental scanning begins, and then the to-phrase, specifying where it ends. This coalignment of paths is optimal from the processing standpoint.

(28) (a) An ugly scar extends from his wrist to his elbow. (b) An ugly scar extends from his elbow to his wrist. (c) An ugly scar extends to his wrist from his elbow.

In (28)(c), however, the two paths run counter to one another. Scanning along the scar starts at the elbow, but word order ﬁrst directs attention to the wrist, at the endpoint of the scanning path. Hence a conceptual account based on dynamicity implies the need for backtracking: after initially processing the whole expression, the conceptualizer needs to back up and reconceptualize the full scanning path in the proper sequence in order to properly apprehend the overall conﬁguration. This makes an experimental prediction: namely, that (28)(c) should take longer to process and require greater effort than the other expressions.
A frequent criticism of cognitive linguistics, that it makes no predictions, is therefore erroneous. It is, however, true that its predictions tend to be relativistic instead of absolute. For instance, one cannot predict in absolute terms precisely which nouns can occur in the construction in (27)(b). In particular, one cannot make a yes/no prediction about a noun’s cooccurrence with stand just by examining objectively discernible properties of the nominal referent. What counts is how a situation is construed, which involves general and contextual knowledge as well as our full range of imaginative and interpretive abilities. It is not a matter of deciding categorically whether a certain combination is or is not grammatical, but rather of ascertaining the kind and degree of motivation it has in view of all relevant factors—hence the dictum in cognitive linguistics that, while virtually everything is motivated, very little is subject to absolute predictability.
A standard view, long predominant in semantic theory, is that a conceptual account of meaning is either impossible or necessarily unscientiﬁc. A scientiﬁcally

respectable semantics is presumed to be objectivist in nature, subject to discrete formalization, and capable of strict predictability. However, I have tried to indicate that this approach to meaning is not the only game in town. Conceptual semantics is possible, and it is developing into a rigorous scientiﬁc enterprise. Ideally, and increasingly in practice, cognitive semantic descriptions are based on careful analysis, supported by empirical evidence, and formulated in terms of well-justiﬁed descriptive constructs. And in no small measure, conceptual semantics derives support from its efﬁcacy as the basis for characterizing grammatical structure. This will be our focus in the chapters that follow.
