Abstract
This thesis explores the Classical Hebrew concept of ‘distress’ through the Cognitive Linguistic approach of George Lakoff, Mark Johnson, and Zoltán Kövecses. It investigates the conceptual metaphors ancient Hebrew speakers used to conceptualise their distressing experiences through basic embodied experiences. It studies image schemas (recurring patterns of experience) and primary metaphors (such as cognitive links between darkness and distress) which give structure to distressing situations and suggest actions to take. It provides a detailed and descriptive inventory of the main image schemas (VERTICALITY, CONSTRAINT and FORCE) and primary metaphors (DARKNESS and BAD TASTE) reflected in the conventional Hebrew language of distress found in the Psalms, Lamentations, Job and the Hodayot.
The first chapter introduces the topic of conventional distress language, arguing that the Cognitive Linguistic approach provides a useful complement to previous studies of the matter. The second chapter describes the theoretical semantic framework, particularly arguing that where it opposes James Barr’s lexical semantics it is nevertheless linguistically justified. Chapters three and four identify a specific corpus of Classical Hebrew texts that refer to situations of distress, and show how these texts are classifiable according to image schemas and metaphors. Chapters five, six and seven present all the examples of conceptualisations of distress based on the VERTICALITY, CONSTRAINT and FORCE schemas, respectively, and compare them to similar metaphors in other languages. They argue that in Classical Hebrew the FORCE schema is the most significant for conceptualising negative experience, and that, further, the CONSTRAINT schema is both more entrenched and more linguistically elaborated than the CONSTRAINT schema in English, and than the VERTICALITY schema in Hebrew. These chapters establish that forces and constrained situations are more significant for understanding situations of distress than up or down movement. Chapters eight and nine present conceptualisations of distress based on DARKNESS and BAD TASTE, arguing that the way vision and taste are perceived in Hebrew constrains the way distress is understood through metaphor. The conclusion argues that all these metaphors cohere to create a prototypical conceptualisation of distress, whose characteristic features are that it is unexpected by the sufferer, unjustified, and caused by a personal external agent. Moreover, these metaphors highlight that distress is an experience sufferers are unable to relieve by their own means.

Acknowledgements
This thesis would have been impossible without the help of many people, just some of whom can be thanked here. First and foremost, my supervisor Jean-Marc Heimerdinger has encouraged me throughout, both in person, and via Skype to Papua New Guinea. He also first instilled in me a love of the Hebrew Psalms, and it is still his voice I hear in my head as I read them. Other staff at London School of Theology also sowed seeds for this thesis: Deryck Sheriffs first challenged me to probe the emotions of the psalmists; and Peter Riddell first opened my eyes to biblical semantics.
Several colleagues have provided further encouragement and support along the way, listening to ideas and providing feedback. In Northwood, fellow students in the Guthrie Centre shared their lunch and their time, especially Nick Gatzke, Andy Bannister and Maurice Rubin. In Papua New Guinea, special thanks go to René van den Berg and Anne Henderson for always being willing to discuss Hebrew and linguistics. Other SIL colleagues offered listening ears and thoughtful comments, especially during coffee break times at LCORE. Matt Taylor, Ben Pehrson, Pekka and Maiju Laihia, and Paul Minter all deserve thanks for their help in the last stages, freeing me from other responsibilities and repeatedly encouraging me to keep going.
Financially, I am very grateful to the sponsorship of both SIL International and SIL PNG who contributed significantly to the course fees, and to Emmanuel Church, Northwood, and Holywell Church, Loughborough, as well as other friends and family, who have continued to support us throughout this project. Physically, I am grateful to the physiotherapists who helped me get through the long hours of sitting behind a computer.
Within my family, my parents grounded me in the intellectual disciplines of science and theology and have continued to believe in me throughout the years. My children, Simeon and Joshua, have shared their dad with this project for most of their lives, and I am thankful for their acceptance of this and simple demonstrations of encouragement. However, the biggest thanks are for my wife, Kate, who has sacrificed the most to enable this project to reach completion. Words are not enough to thank her for her continual love and support.

Chapter 1: Conventional Distress Language

Chapter 1: Conventional Distress Language
‘You have put me in the depths of the pit, in the regions dark and deep’ Psalm 88.6[7]
1.1. Introduction
How can people communicate meaningfully about distressing psychological and emotional experiences? In English, the experience of up-and-down movement offers some possibilities: someone may be down or low; nosedive, spiral and crash; or hit rock bottom and have to climb out again. All these expressions use the embodied experience of movement in relation to gravity to communicate the experience of English depression. However, how universal is this way of understanding such experiences? Are other types of embodied experience used in other cultures? This thesis investigates the experiences used in Hebrew.

The exploration is rooted in the conventional language of distress found in Classical Hebrew texts (including biblical and Qumranic material). The Cognitive Linguistics of George Lakoff, Mark Johnson and Zoltán Kövecses then provides a framework to investigate the most significant image schemas (recurring patterns of bodily experience) and primary metaphors (basic associations between perceptual and other more abstract domains) used to conceptualise distress, mapping structure from experiential domains of containment, force, sight and taste to the more abstract domain of distress. The first challenge, however, is to identify such conventional language and briefly compare this approach with other approaches to it.
1.2. Approaches to Conventional Language
Several images for distressing life experiences (including darkness, nets, ‘the Pit’, or bitter food) recur throughout Classical Hebrew texts. This is unsurprising, since ‘“originality” of metaphoric invention does not appear to have been a consciously prized poetic value’.1

Texts using such images sometimes contain near identical clauses, as in Psalm 143.3 and Lamentations 3.6:
1 R. Alter, The Art of Biblical Poetry (New York: Basic Books, 1985), 189.

Chapter 1: Conventional Distress Language

2

Psalm 143.3: Making me sit in darkness like those long dead.2
Lamentations 3.6: He has made me sit in darkness like those long dead.3
Elsewhere, texts only overlap thematically, with little shared vocabulary, as in Lamentations 3.2 and Job 30.28:
% " ! $ " ! #" Lamentations 3.2: He has driven and brought me into darkness without any light.
& " '() *" Job 30.28: Darkling I wander, lacking the daystar.4
Such recurring images have been studied in various ways. For historical criticism, they indicate authorship, date and provenance, for form criticism they represent cultic liturgy, and for literary criticism they show intertextual relationships. Alternatively, this language may reflect universal psychology. These perspectives will be outlined below, before introducing the complementary conceptual metaphor perspective used in this thesis.
1.2.1. Historical Criticism and Idiosyncratic Language Specific common images or expressions may place texts historically, though often inconclusively for poetry. Thus, specific images could date Job to Solomon’s time (given affinities to Psalms 88 and 89)5 through to the post-exilic period (given similarities to Hezekiah’s thanksgiving in First Isaiah).6 Similarly, common authorship of Lamentations and Jeremiah is suggested by the common imagery and language.7 Alternatively, the imprisonment imagery of Lamentations 3 suggests an exilic provenance similar to Second

Isaiah.8 Finally, analysis of common motifs among the Hodayot also suggests common authorship, helping ascertain which (if any) come from the ‘Teacher of Righteousness’.9

However, rather than being idiosyncratic, these expressions may rather reflect ‘a common fund of technical lament terminology which was used in the laments of the Psalter, the book of Job and Lamentations’.10 Conceptual metaphor theory explains this cognitively, suggesting fairly stable mappings between mental domains (such as ‘bad tastes’ and ‘distressing experiences’) giving rise to this conventional ‘lament terminology’, metaphorical mappings exploited by different writers in slightly different ways. As Gibbs claims, ‘the way creative writers compose is not unlimited’ but constrained by ‘the ways we actually think of our ordinary experiences’.11 Thus, although one author may have a particularly salient mapping between two domains, so that similar phrases may suggest common authorship, the emphasis here will be on the commonalities in linguistic metaphors, and what they reveal concerning common thinking about distress.
1.2.2. Form Criticism and Liturgical Language
Second, form criticism prioritises the use and transmission of texts in religious settings over their original historical setting.12 Thus, conventional depictions of distress in Gunkel’s laments and thanksgiving songs are seen as basically liturgical and, to a degree, merely formulaic. For von Rad, then, this language only expresses actual suffering ‘in a few typical and very faded concepts’, severely diminishing the personal element.13 Thus, the Psalms are ‘in no sense whatever to be understood as personal outpourings, … but as discourses bound to the cult and the liturgy’.14 Kraus is more positive, arguing that while the phraseology is ‘conventionalised’ it is nevertheless ‘a living language, open to manifold possibilities of application’.15

In Cognitive Linguistics, expressions that reflect ‘systematic metaphorical concepts … [and] structure our actions and thoughts … are “alive” in the most fundamental sense: they are metaphors we live by. The fact that they are conventionally fixed … makes them no less alive’.16 Thus, even if language is ‘typical’, the concepts reflected are not necessarily ‘very faded’, but may significantly influence thought and action. Such typical language perpetuated within the cult defines and consolidates participants’ conceptualisations of what distress ‘is’ and frames their experiences as problems to be solved.17
Form criticism, therefore, usefully emphasises the conventional nature of distress language, and its use by generations of worshippers in varied settings. However, it prompts the question as to how the entrenchment of these metaphors and prototypical situations in liturgy might have served to structure the life experiences of participants in Israel’s religion.
1.2.3. Literary Criticism and Intertextual Language
Third, literary criticism recognises that texts are not independent entities but ‘inevitably shot through with references, quotations and influences of every kind’,18 so that conventional distress language may allude to other texts. This ‘intertextuality’ can consider influences from just written texts, or experiences of any kind. Biblical research has investigated both the rhetorical use of earlier texts to enrich and authorise claims, and the intentional and unintentional allusions of literary language.19 For example, Second Isaiah may have deliberately recollected the figure of Lamentations 3 in his writing.20 Johnston describes intertextuality in the Psalms as conventional images ‘juxtaposed kaleidoscopically to become alternative and interchangeable images, a common stock of expressions for distress.

distinctiveness of each poem lies not so much in its unique images (though these do occur occasionally) as in its unique blend of the common ones’.21

The Dead Sea Scrolls provide a supreme instance of intertextuality,22 revealing a community that interpreted the Scriptures differently from the New Testament authors, using them to give their theology a biblical base and establish the community’s self-understanding.23 For example, intertextual practices in a Qumranic Messianic text use biblical texts to ‘reciprocally contribute to each other’s significance by limiting, extending, focusing and emending what they would mean in isolation’ giving the text ‘meanings that are not otherwise present in the same words’.24

The more dispersed intertextual relationships of the Hodayot may reflect similar deliberate compositions of texts. Holm-Nielsen concluded that the author bound himself to Old Testament words since ‘he felt himself to be in the same situation as portrayed in the Old Testament’ so the significant issue is ‘not that these expressions suit in detail his own life, but that the Old Testament portrayals are now fulfilled in his own experience’.25 HolmNielsen’s method tended to overemphasise correspondences,26 but it is still usually assumed that the Hodayot’s distress imagery refers deliberately to particular scriptural passages.

Qumran’s authors undoubtedly knew the Psalms and their conventional language well. The
interesting aspect for a conceptual metaphor approach is that authors still use these
conventional metaphors to conceptualise their own experience. Previous scholarship
presumed that the community simply copied conventional language, but recent comparison
of the Cave 1 Hodayot lacunae with Cave 4 documents show several places where the
linguistic metaphors vary more significantly than expected from the biblical texts. Such
creative elaboration of metaphors suggests the imagery is still ‘active’ in the author’s mind,

not just dead convention,27 so provides a way in to how the authors thought about and acted upon distressing situations.

1.2.4. Psychological Interpretation and the Language of Humanity
The fourth set of approaches are psychological, investigating the common vocabulary and forms of Hebrew distress discourse as a reflection of pan-cultural psychological phenomena, as in Ryken’s investigation of archetypes,28 in Brueggemann’s hermeneutical approach to lament psalms29 and in various cross-cultural studies of distress language.

First, Ryken’s The Dictionary of Biblical Imagery sees conventional imagery of traps or darkness as archetypes, which are images and symbols recurring ‘not only throughout the Bible, but in literature generally and in life’. Archetypes originate in Jungian psychology, where they are universal, primal and innate. For Ryken, archetypes are a ‘universal language’, understood ‘simply by virtue of being human’, so that ‘we all know the experiences of hunger and thirst, garden and wilderness’.30 Whilst Ryken is correct that hunger and thirst have physiological justification as universal experiences, the latter two do not, as shown by attempts to translate either garden or wilderness into Papua New Guinean languages. The dictionary articles themselves distinguish more carefully between universal and culture-specific imagery. Similarly, in this thesis, certain embodied experiences (such as containment or force) are considered universal and thus ‘archetypal’. Other embodied experiences, such as bird-trapping, are more culture-specific, evoking a ‘limited range of associated commonplaces’31 when used in metaphor.

Second, Brueggemann uses psychology and linguistics to explore the function of conventional metaphors in lament psalms within the common life of faith.32 His Freudian approach emphasises universal experiences, arguing that people in all eras and cultures

experience ‘dislocation and disorientation’,33 which typically drive people to ‘the extremities of emotion, integrating capacity, and of language’,34 so that when an orderly life is lost people can no longer affirm the conventional assertions of blessing and security. The alternative language found should not be ‘reduced to clichés’.35 Instead, ‘the rich array of language in which the words tumble out becomes … a pastoral opportunity to let the impressionistic speech touch the particular circumstance of dislocation’.36 Thus, while Brueggemann acknowledges recurring metaphors of pits, enemies and snares, he is only interested in the specifics of these metaphors to the extent they reflect timeless human experiences, so that he argues one can say that for today’s English-speaking world ‘to fall into “the pit” is indeed to lose one’s old equilibrium’.37

Following Brueggemann, Cognitive Linguistics emphasises that lament language is a way of viewing reality rather than an exegetical problem to be solved in terms of Sitz im Leben or formal structure. However, it sees language, and especially metaphor, as very important for structuring experience itself. Brueggemann’s attempts to parallel the negative experiences of his contemporaries and the psalmist requires today’s conceptual metaphors and image schemas,38 conceptualising them as ‘extremities’, ‘disorientation’, ‘disintegration’, ‘lost equilibrium’, ‘displacement’ or ‘regression’. Rather than reflecting Hebrew conceptual metaphors, these show the significance of image schemas of BALANCE39 (‘losing’ and ‘regaining’ equilibrium, totally absent from the Hebrew corpus), NEAR-FAR (in ‘extremity’), and PATH (‘orientation / disorientation / reorientation’) for structuring contemporary distress metaphors. This thesis explores how metaphors of pits, snares, enemies and darkness give structure to negative experiences, and how this differs from a modern American who feels he has ‘lost his equilibrium’.

Third, Dobbs-Allsopp compares conventional language in Lamentations 3 with language of severe trauma elsewhere. Grief-filled Polish texts do not go beyond or disintegrate traditional expressions, suggesting that ‘in response to horrific situations, people draw on the traditional motifs they know well’,40 rather than creating novel metaphors. Further, using stereotyped images allows ‘a multiplicity of identities and settings’,41 where they can be fitted ‘for the saying of the unsayable’.42 Psychological studies by Kübler-Ross43 and Spiegel44 also suggest universal patterns in distress. Moore thus argues that the imagery and language of Lamentations enables the nation to do the necessary emotional ‘grief work’.45 Brueggemann also recognises the psychological benefit of having existing forms to use in situations of grief.46 Joyce defends the supposed inconsistencies of Lamentations, arguing that a mixture of hope and despair is typical of the grief processes. Joyce also helpfully acknowledges that an identity of psychological grief processes in Hebrew and Modern Western society cannot be assumed.47

Cognitive Linguistics similarly explores universal psychological and emotional phenomena, and investigates the relationship between these and conventional language. However, it also recognises the different ways universal experiences are structured in specific cultures.
1.2.5. Cultural Linguistic Interpretation and the Language of Conceptual Metaphor
The conceptual metaphor approach adds an extra perspective to conventional language, using cognitive science and linguistic anthropology to investigate how particular metaphors used in distress conceptualise negative experiences, giving them culture-specific structure. This approach is rooted in research by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson,48 but more recently also by Mark Turner,49 Raymond Gibbs50 and Zoltán Kövecses.51

Following historical criticism, this approach recognises linguistic expressions may be peculiar to a particular time or author. However, it searches for commonalities across different texts to investigate how these unique expressions stem from similar understandings of reality. Following the intertextual approach, it recognises conventional language may deliberately allude to other texts. However, it focuses on how common embodied experiences and conceptualisations may guide which texts are re-used. The psychological approach has most commonalities, with both approaches recognising far-reaching psychological influences on language content and form. However, the approach of this thesis recognises that psychology itself may be influenced by culture, so that recurring themes reveal a unique set of ethnopsychological contours, not just universal archetypes.
1.3. Purpose and Outline of the Thesis
This research has three aims. First, from a linguistic perspective, it contributes further to applications of conceptual metaphor theory to Classical Hebrew, testing theses generated from a study of contemporary English on an ancient text. Specifically, it adds a further

investigation of conceptual metaphors and metonymies used to structure emotion concepts.52 Second, from a Biblical Studies perspective, this thesis provides a comprehensive catalogue of the metaphors used to structure the experience of distress within the specific corpus in consideration, showing its most significant ethnopsychological contours. Third, by performing this interdisciplinary study, some new insights will be offered concerning the relationship between language and thought in Hebrew linguistics.

The thesis is organised in the following way. The next chapter focuses on the relation between culture, language and thought. Conceptual metaphor theory holds a relatively strong position on cognitive and linguistic relativity. That is, it is foundational to this research that the conventional language different cultures use to speak about experiences of distress reflect different ways of thinking about these experiences. This is not a generally accepted position in Biblical Studies, so the chapter will substantiate this claim more fully, situating it within twentieth-century approaches to semantics and linguistic relativity, particularly dialoguing with James Barr’s work in Hebrew linguistics.

Having laid this foundation, the third and fourth chapters introduce the research methodology, focusing first on the corpus of texts to be used and then on the way they will be analysed and presented.

The following chapters cover the main conceptual metaphors that appear through analysing the texts. First, basic image schemas will be considered, with chapter five looking at the VERTICALITY schema, chapter six at the CONSTRAINT schema and chapter seven at the FORCE schema. Chapter eight turns to the primary metaphor of darkness and chapter nine to primary metaphors based on bad taste. Finally, the conclusion summarises the results and presents the implications of this research.

Chapter 2: Culture, Language and Thought

‘As soon as evidence from linguistic phenomena is used in the contrast of … ways of thinking, a relation is being established between mental patterns and linguistic structure. What has not been apparent when such evidence has been used in theological discussion … has been the consciousness of how difficult a problem such a relation constitutes and how impossible it is to bypass the discussion of it in philosophy, psychology and linguistics.’ James Barr53

‘It is all too easy to indulge in imaginative nonsense.’ Norman Porteous54

2.1. Introduction
This research is about conceptualising distress, and thus, fundamentally, about how people think. The only evidence of how Classical Hebrew speakers thought is found in the texts they left, a few tokens of their language. Native intuition is inaccessible. So, what can language reveal about how people think? Moreover, how does language affect the way communities perceive and conceptualise the world they live in?
Clarifying the relationship between language and thought has long exercised philosophers, anthropologists and linguists. Some focus on universals and the ‘psychic unity of mankind’, others emphasise ‘linguistic relativity’, urging that differences in language across the globe must be reflected in different ways of thinking. Perhaps language reflects, influences, constrains, guides, or even determines thought processes. This chapter will summarise some of the central issues.
The aim of this chapter is threefold. First, it theoretically grounds the cognitive semantics used throughout this thesis, emphasising embodied experience and culture-specific conventional knowledge. These emphases began with Humboldt, Boas, Sapir and Whorf, who are the founders of the linguistic relativity tradition on which cognitive semantics rests.

Their approach was developed by Rosch and Fillmore. The concepts of prototypes, scripts, semantic networks and conceptual metonymies will all be introduced here. Second, this chapter introduces more recent Cognitive Linguists whose contributions frame this research. Third, it discusses significant applications of linguistics to Biblical Studies against this backdrop. Specifically, it interacts with James Barr, whose forceful critique of carelessly applied Whorfian linguistics has dominated for fifty years. The argument will show how Cognitive Linguistics can be used without suffering the same criticisms as the preceding linguistic models.

A chronological perspective will be presented, surveying linguistics and Biblical Studies from Boasian linguistics and its Humboldtian heritage (section 2.2) to the biblical semantics of James Barr and John Sawyer (section 2.3), then on to Cognitive Linguistics, both at its foundation (section 2.4) and, most fully, in its more recent development by Lakoff, Johnson, Langacker, Talmy, Taylor, Gibbs and Kövecses (section 2.5). Finally recent applications to Biblical Studies will be surveyed (section 2.6).
2.2. The Tradition of Linguistic Relativity: Humboldt, Boas, Sapir and Whorf
2.2.1. Humboldt (1767-1835): Language Determines Characteristic Worldview Carl Wilhelm von Humboldt was an influential founding figure for relativist linguistics,55 beginning to relate the global diversity of linguistic structures to a new post-Kantian philosophy in which an objective world was no longer accessible. He maintained that each language contains a characteristic worldview and ‘draws a circle around the people to whom it adheres which it is possible for the individual to escape only by stepping into a different one’.56

55 Although some of his ideas had a longer heritage, E. F. K. Koerner, ‘Towards a "Full Pedigree" of
the "Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis": From Locke to Lucy’ in M. Pütz and M. H. Verspoor (eds.), Explorations in Linguistic Relativity (Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 2000), 1-23, 3.

Chapter 2: Culture, Language and Thought

13

However, linguistic features like parts of speech or case are universal, acting as guiding principles within languages even when there was no explicit form to represent them.57 Since mental capacities are universal, ‘the form of all languages must be essentially the same’.58 Thus, while new evidence on ‘exotic’ languages directed Humboldt towards relativity, with language somewhat constraining a person’s worldview, his anthropological presuppositions precluded much real difference.

2.2.2. Boas (1858-1942): Language Reflects Unconscious Categories
Next, Franz Boas, the founder of American anthropological linguistics, sought to empirically validate Humboldt's ideas.59 His Introduction to the Handbook of American Indian Languages carefully outlines the relationship between language and thought. For example, he doubted Humboldt’s contention that grammatical forms of a language permanently constrain its speakers’ thoughts. Rather, ‘generalised’ forms would ‘develop just as soon as needed’ for new ideas,60 since humanity is psychologically equal. He substantiated this by making a Kwakiutl speaker conceive a meaning for an abstract form which usually required inalienable possession. Thus, ‘language alone would not prevent a people from advancing to more generalised forms of thinking if the general state of their culture should require expression of such thought; … under these conditions the language would be moulded rather by the cultural state’.61

However, Boas was very interested in how languages make accessible unconscious mental processes, without secondary explanations,62 advocating searching analyses of linguistic concepts, especially investigating ‘the grouping of ideas in different languages’.63 For Boas, then, a language does not dictate how its speakers have to think, but, through unconscious categorisation, it reflects how speakers habitually think.

2.2.3. Sapir (1884-1939): Language Creates Different Worlds
Edward Sapir studied under Boas and developed his ideas, becoming a key figure in
American structuralism. His famous statement on linguistic relativity was first read in 1928:
Human beings do not live in the objective world alone ... but are very much at the mercy of the particular language which has become the medium of expression for their society. ... The fact of the matter is that the "real-world" is to a large extent unconsciously built on the language habits of the group. ... The worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same world with different labels attached … Even comparatively simple acts of perception are very much more at the mercy of the social patterns called words than we might suppose.64

Here language is an oppressive master, holding speakers ‘at its mercy’, whereas for Boas it was more subservient, ‘moulded … by the cultural state’.65 Further, Boas’ contention that an Indian could ‘reach abstract forms strictly corresponding to the abstract forms of our modern languages’66 still betrayed a Platonic idealism that these concepts exist independently of culture. This universalism is targeted by Sapir’s warning that we actually live in different worlds, not the same world with different labels. For example, chapter eight will show how visual perception is influenced by language. Whereas in English darkness is a scalar concept related to degrees of light, there is no evidence that the most similar concepts in Hebrew were conceived as gradable, so they are not just darkness with another label.
2.2.4. Whorf (1897-1941): Language Organises the ‘Kaleidoscope Flux’ of Impressions
Next, Benjamin Lee Whorf was a largely self-taught American linguist. His ‘principle of linguistic relativity’ states that:
The world is presented in a kaleidoscope flux of impressions which has to be organised by our minds – and this means largely by the linguistic systems in our minds. We cut nature up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this way – an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of our language. The agreement is, of course, an implicit and unstated one, but its terms are absolutely obligatory; we cannot talk at all except by subscribing to the organization and classification of data which the agreement decrees.67

Whorf sought to empirically demonstrate the relationship between linguistic structure and habitual thought, by comparing English and Hopi. Following Sapir and Boas, Whorf was interested in the unconscious structure of language and the influence this has on thinking, such as the semantic similarities between verbs that can take the prefix un- in English. He argued that a language’s ‘constant ways of arranging data’68 became part of the ‘habitual thought’ of its speakers. Thus, linguistics lights up a community’s thought and culture, allowing ‘a heuristic approach to problems of psychology which hitherto [a researcher] may have shrunk from considering’.69

For Whorf, these culturally relative influences pervade both grammar and lexicon. For example, there is a ‘far-reaching compulsion from large-scale patterning of grammatical categories, such as plurality, gender and similar classifications’,70 so that things sharing a gender are thought about in similar ways. Further, Whorf operates on a structuralist basis, with language limiting the free plasticity of culture because ‘language is a system’. Whereas culture can change quickly, the language system ‘can change to something really new only very slowly’ and thus language ‘represents the mass mind’.71

Whorf also discusses how metaphor reveals differences in thinking between peoples. For example, he found an ‘almost inexhaustible’ set of metaphors from the field of spatial extension to describe duration and intensity in Standard Average European72 (SAE), contrasted with very few non-metaphorical terms. 73 Thus, speakers ‘can hardly refer to the simplest nonspatial situation without constant resort to physical metaphors’.74 The extraordinary thing is the lack of such spatialisation in Hopi, supporting linguistic relativity.

Nevertheless, Whorf recognised that contemporary linguistic descriptions were insufficient to be categorical about implications from language structure to mentality. He advocated surveying many more languages, including a grammar for each ‘worked out scientifically and on the basis of the language’s own patterns and classes, and as free as possible from any general presuppositions about grammatical logic’.75

Whorf has been both dismissed outright and uncritically approved, with, until recently, very few attempts to systematically prove or disprove his hypothesis. The Chomskyan emphasis on universal syntax pushed Whorf’s views into contempt, but they have resurfaced since the 1990s. John Lucy has particularly attempted to test Whorf’s hypothesis.76 Sydney Lamb has also used neurocognitive research to confirm that ‘languaging’ during infancy influences perception and thought throughout life, since top-down effects operate from conceptual structure to lower perceptual layers in the brain.77 However, the next step here is to return to Whorf’s time and the vigorous critique from James Barr.
2.3. Linguistics and Biblical Studies I: Barr and Sawyer
2.3.1. Barr (1924-2006) James Barr’s work, particularly The Semantics of Biblical Language78 (1961), is important for the prominent position his negative critique of linguistic relativity has gained in Biblical Studies. Recent treatments of biblical linguistics still devote significant sections to Barr’s work, with little or no qualification.79

Barr primarily attacks the presuppositions and methodology used in Biblical Studies to argue
for profound differences between Hebrew and Greek minds, claiming that any approach that

assumes linguistic structure reflects thought structure is ‘wholly outmoded’.80 He advocates a ‘strict and systematic method of discussing the relation between grammatical structures and lexical phenomena on the one hand and the Hebrew or Greek mind or any other national or cultural mind on the other’.81 Further, this method must be integrated with general linguistics and applied to the whole language. Embarking on ‘demonstrating how the features of Hebrew thought are built into Hebrew language, without giving full thought to these requisites, indicates a serious over-confidence and an ignoring of basic problems’.82 As this thesis is such an embarkation, Barr’s arguments need careful examination.

Barr’s attacks are rooted in Saussurean structuralism, and where he quotes contemporary linguists they are structuralists like Bloomfield and Ullmann. Thus, insistence that biblical theologians must heed ‘modern linguistics’ means structuralist emphases on synchronic rather than diachronic description, on descriptions of language as a system and not as isolated parts, and on the arbitrary nature of words,83 whose meaning is determined by their indication of ‘an essential difference’84 to other words within the linguistic system, rather than etymology or ‘inner meaning’.

Representing Barr’s targets, Snaith argues that the first word of Psalm 1 ( + , normally translated happy or blessed) comes from a root meaning ‘to go straight ahead’, illustrating Hebrew thought, where ‘a happy man is the man who goes straight ahead’.85 Snaith and others often unquestioningly appropriated information on word meanings in newlydiscovered cognate languages. Strengthened by popular ethnopsychology and linguistic relativity, they produced many thought-provoking, but not necessarily linguistically wellgrounded, claims about Hebrew thought.

Chapter 2: Culture, Language and Thought

18

Five of Barr’s most relevant arguments about the relationship between language, culture and thought are outlined below, based mainly on Semantics, which includes his fiercest critique of the ethnopsychology of Herder, Humboldt and Whorf.
a) No Simple Correspondence between Language Structure and Thought Structure
First, Barr argues one cannot assume a simple correspondence between language structure and thought structure, whether in grammar or vocabulary,86 since in fact some peoples have very common worldviews despite radically different languages (such as Finns versus Swedes), whereas others have very similar languages yet different worldviews (such as fourth-century Jews versus Phoenicians).87 Thus, grammatical structure (such as the verbal system or lack of a copula) cannot show Hebrew thought is more ‘dynamic’ than Greek.88 Similarly, grammatical gender ‘cannot be taken to reflect a thought pattern’,89 since the lack of distinct gender in Turkish does not mean Turks cannot differentiate male and female.90

Regarding vocabulary, the absence of distinct words does not imply the absence of distinct mental concepts (such as the ‘lack’ of a Hebrew ‘body’ / ‘soul’ distinction) nor does the existence of more than one word reflect a ‘need’ to distinguish mental concepts.91 Such arguments fail to appreciate both the often unmotivated historical background for the words available in a given domain and the possibility of thinking about something without having a word to describe it.92

Since identity cannot be assumed between linguistic and mental structure, Barr argues any theologian addressing Hebrew thought must explicate his or her assumptions on the relationship between linguistic structures and mental patterns.93 This chapter fulfils precisely this purpose within this thesis.

19

b) No Privileged Cultural Mind
Second, presuppositions about the way people think in a culture cannot be used to interpret linguistic evidence.94 Barr’s contemporaries presumed the Hebrew mind viewed the world a certain way (from anthropological claims about ‘primitive’ mentality or theological convictions regarding the peculiarity, and superiority, of the Hebrew mentality), so linguistic evidence supporting this was presented, ignoring other evidence and alternative hypotheses. Barr claimed that his opponents defended the peculiarity of Hebrew psychology on the basis of the peculiarity of linguistic phenomena that were actually very widespread, through ignorance of general linguistics and failure to critically examine their own languages.95 Instead, they needed a respectable linguistic methodology examining the whole language, one integrated with general linguistics, and ‘open to relevant data for semantics of any language’.96 It can be said that the Cognitive Linguistic methodology fits these criteria, originating in mainstream linguistics and increasingly well tested cross-linguistically.
c) Correct Use of Etymology
Third, Barr attacks abuses of etymology, stressing that a word’s original meaning does not determine its current meaning.97 Following Saussure, synchronic considerations (how a word fits with other possibilities in a language system at a given point in time) have priority over diachronic considerations (when a word originated). Before Barr, scholars used cognate languages to establish the ‘exact’ meanings of Hebrew words, even when spoken centuries earlier in different settings.98 However, Barr found English words whose meaning changed beyond recognition even within one language and thus showed the falsity of supposing ‘that the etymology of a word is necessarily a guide either to its ‘proper’ meaning in a later period or to its actual meaning in that period’.99 The use of ‘necessarily’ is important: Barr is not saying that a word’s etymology is always irrelevant, just that one cannot assume uncritically

that etymology is determinative of a word’s current meaning. Thus, in Snaith's exegesis of Psalm 1 (introduced at the start of section 3.1) he does not attack the use of etymological evidence, but that ‘the etymological associations are used without any inquiry whether they existed in the minds of those who used the poem’.100

d) The Root Fallacy

Fourth, the same Hebrew root for two words is insufficient evidence of associations between

them in speakers’ minds. Those who assert a ‘root meaning’ commit the ‘root fallacy’. In

the case of $ $ (bread) and

(war), for example, it is ‘doubtful whether the

influence of their common root is of any importance . . . in the normal usage of the words’.101 Although Boman produces the root meaning of being ‘closely packed’,102 he misses Barr’s

real point, which is whether this meaning influences normal usage.

Barr claims only forms produced by ‘narrowly grammatical variation’, such as the paradigm of forms for different persons as subject, could be influenced by a ‘root meaning’. Conversely, the different conjugations (like the hiphil) are new semantic formations with potentially their own ‘semantic history’.103 Thus, ‘to be guided by the “fundamental meaning” of a “root” in discussing the various extant forms is to neglect the force of wordformation, which creates, or may create, separate fields of significance for what are independent forms’.104 Later, Barr is more constructive, affirming ‘a “root” is semantically significant, in a synchronic sense, usually only where the root morpheme is active and productive, usually as a rather basic verb or noun, in the Hebrew of biblical times’.105
e) The Unitary Concept Fallacy
Fifth, Barr argues that the same form in multiple contexts is insufficient evidence to argue a meaning overlap in these contexts. He calls this the unitary concept fallacy. Theologians must avoid illegitimately carrying the entire situated meaning of a word in one context to

Barr, ‘Three Interrelated Factors in the Semantic Study of Ancient Hebrew’, ZAH 7 (1994) 3344, 35.

21

another context, as when ‘good’ used eschatologically in one context is taken to imply that ‘good’ always has an eschatological meaning.106

This issue relates to polysemy and homonymy, which are important in Cognitive Linguistics,107 so Barr’s views need consideration. Polysemy is usually defined as a word having more than one sense, whereas homonymy is two distinct words that have developed the same form. The difference is historical: for polysemy the senses originated in some motivated way from an original meaning, whereas in homonymy the ‘accidental’ coming together of two forms produces multiple senses. As Barr acknowledges, history may not effect the perceived links between words for current speakers, since many English speakers assume a polysemous relationship between a human ‘ear’ and an ‘ear’ of corn, despite originating from distinct roots.

Polysemy deriving from metaphorical transference is especially significant for this thesis. Consider the English example ‘seethe’. Although the first dictionary definition usually describes a bubbling liquid, contemporary English uses it much more commonly with an angry human subject, potentially still evoking the ‘bubbling liquid’ meaning. Such metaphorical transference is central to conceptual metaphor theory. Barr’s synchronic emphasis means that he allows only minimal impact of such possible metaphorical transference on semantics, so that senses for a word derived this way should not be assumed
to activate links to a possible original more literal sense. For example, discussing ,
usually translated ‘sin’ in English, but also used to describe how the Benjaminites could throw a stone at a single hair and not ‘miss’ (Judges 20.16), Barr dismisses the idea that ‘missing a target’ is accessible in every use of the word, saying it is ‘more likely’ that the meaning is ‘do wrongly’. The Benjaminite’s success is then an extension of not ‘doing wrongly’. More generally, Barr criticises ‘the overemphasising of ‘concrete’ or physical meanings in the presentation of lexical material’.108 Similarly, Barr dismisses the proposed link between ‘belief’ and ‘established’, arguably visible through the common consonants

, .109 Cognitive Linguistics prioritises the ‘concrete’, perceptual, and ‘embodied’ for understanding more abstract domains,110 so there is potential conflict with Barr here.

Despite Barr’s polemicism and tendency towards criticism rather than constructing his own linguistic methodology,111 Semantics was widely acclaimed, as a ‘trumpet blast against the monstrous regiment of shoddy linguistics’.112 Subsequent authors hesitated to relate Hebrew language and thought. John Sawyer, however, did successfully challenge some of Barr’s assertions.
2.3.2. Sawyer
Sawyer differs from Barr over which words may be mentally linked, and in his approach to root meanings. Further, he began constructing a methodology for deciding whether an etymological connection still has current force in the minds of users.

First, whereas Barr would not assume words are semantically associated unless provable through sound linguistics, Sawyer’s approach is more generous, defining an associative field including ‘all the words associated in any way with a term’.113 These may share a ‘root’, be antonyms or synonyms, or even share similar letters or sounds. This associative field links many more words in a Hebrew speaker’s mind than Barr allowed.

Second, regarding root-meanings, Sawyer is cautiously optimistic, claiming ‘a recurring
group of consonants common to several words carries with it some common semantic element into words and contexts in which it occurs’.114 Comparison should not be made with
Indo-European roots because of three Semitic distinctives: first, compounds are not natural;
second, the root of a Hebrew word is particularly obtrusive; and third, the data is written, so

Tångberg, ‘Linguistics and Theology: An Attempt to Analyze and Evaluate James Barr's Argumentation in The Semantics of Biblical Language and Biblical Words for Time’, BT 24 (1973) 301-310, 310. 112 M.

Chapter 2: Culture, Language and Thought

23

the root can be seen, not just heard. These create ‘transparency’, with semantic components visible in a word’s form, meaning that ‘the root of a Semitic word is of particular importance in communicating information’.115

Finally, concerning metaphorically transferred senses (like ‘seethe’), Sawyer’s methodology

investigates generalisations over polysemy, central to Lakoff’s later theory. Multiple words

having meanings in two distinct domains suggest an active semantic link between the

domains. Whilst Barr claimed that the play on words in Isaiah 7.9 (-

‘you will

believe’ / -

‘you will be established’) could not be explained through root meanings,

Sawyer considered semantic fields in Hebrew connected to both belief or truth (words that collocate with people) and firmness or fixedness (words that collocate with things). Comparison of the fields produces ‘at least four words that can occur both in truth-contexts and in firmness-contexts’.116

Further, Sawyer stresses transfer from concrete to abstract in metaphor, showing that source domains for salvation covered ‘almost every sphere of human experience: light, space, height ... and others’.117 Such transfers likely occurred when the source domain was emotionally charged, so that spatial terminology may have transferred to salvation during territorial expansion.118 Cognitive Linguistics also prioritises motivation, though it prioritises embodied motivation in infanthood above a culture’s historical development.119

Sawyer allows a return from Barr back towards using roots, polysemy and metaphorical transference in semantic description, an increasingly necessary move as linguists began studying language systems less abstractly and more as they are used by individuals. Linguists started investigating how people learn word-meanings and create categories to fit their experiences, integrating developing emphases in other disciplines, including philosophy of language (Wittgenstein), artificial intelligence (Schank), and cognitive psychology (Abelson) to create ‘Cognitive Science’. This research showed that structuralist attempts to

24

define words via oppositions or componential analysis without considering the experiential world of speakers or the scenarios to which such words typically applied, omitted a large area of meaning. The next section introduces some of this research, before turning to the development of Cognitive Linguistics.

2.4. Precursors to Cognitive Linguistics – Wittgenstein, Rosch, Fillmore, Schank, Abelson and Reddy
2.4.1. Wittgenstein (1889-1951): Family Resemblances
Wittgenstein’s later philosophy made the first step towards a new type of semantics (prototype semantics), emphasising that speakers do not mentally check off a list of attributes when using a word, so necessary and sufficient conditions cannot accurately describe semantics. Wittgenstein took the word game and showed there are no common features for all games. Some involve competition, others skill, others just amusement. Instead, games share family resemblances, certain parameters (such as skill) that parallel shared features among family members. The same characteristics are not expected in each family member, similarly identical properties should not be expected in all games.120 For semantic theory, a central sense for a word covering all contextual instantiations should not be expected, but rather networks of possible instantiations sharing various attributes. This emphasis is clearly in line with Barr’s ‘unitary concept fallacy’.
2.4.2. Rosch: Prototypes and Basic Level Categories Eleanor Rosch developed prototype semantics further,121 using cognitive psychology to discover ‘prototype effects’ and the ‘basic level’ of categorisation, delivering the fatal blow to prevailing semantic models using necessary and sufficient features.

First, the feature model suggests every entity with the correct features should be rated equally. Thus, if bird is defined by features like ‘has feathers’ and ‘lays eggs’, then every such creature should be an equally good example. However, Rosch found in several psychological experiments that robins were considered ‘better’ examples than penguins.

Rosch, ‘Principles of Categorization’ in E. Rosch and B. B. Lloyd (eds.), Cognition and Categorization (Hillsdale: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1978), 27-48, cited and discussed in Lakoff, Women, 39-57.

These asymmetries are called prototype effects, showing certain members of a category considered more representative, or prototypical, than others.

Second, certain categories are at the basic level and thus especially privileged, a foundational empirical discovery for cognitive science. 122 For example, when shown a card with a terrier, people normally identify a dog rather than an animal or an Airedale. The category ‘dog’ is thus at the basic-level,123 with the super-ordinate level (animal) and subordinates (terrier, Airedale) less psychologically basic. This is the highest level with a coherent mental image, the level at which entities are related to in similar functional ways, and has names children learn first.

Both results demonstrate gradations in psychological processes, which must be prominent in any cognitively realistic lexical semantics, focusing more on what is typical and salient than necessary or sufficient.
2.4.3. Fillmore: Frames
Charles Fillmore’s frame semantics124 further challenged existing semantic descriptions, endeavouring to account for meaning that relies on the whole scene, or frame for an utterance. Specifically, frames are ‘unified frameworks of knowledge, or cultural schematizations of experience’.125 Thus, the word breakfast126 relies on a sociocultural frame with typically three meals a day and typical foodstuffs consumed at each. This frame allows breakfast to be used when only the food is in focus (‘all day breakfasts’) or when something different (salad, for example) is eaten in the morning. Words then evoke frames (like the three-meal-a-day frame evoked by breakfast) that need retrieving to understand an utterance.127

2.4.4. Schank and Abelson: Scripts
Roger Schank and Robert Abelson were developing a computer programme to understand natural language when they discovered that much implicit information needed to understand texts came not from words but from knowledge structures arising from life experiences.128 On hearing ‘John likes apples’, we presume he likes eating apples, because this is the typical relationship humans have with apples. The computer needed these knowledge structures, not just a lexicon and a grammar.

Much of this is structured in scripts, ‘a predetermined, stereotyped sequence of actions that defines a well-known situation’.129 Scripts may be activated by individual words, allowing much information to be left implicit. English speakers can process ‘the waitress’ after the word ‘restaurant’ has been used in a discourse because the script has been activated.130

Scripts mean embodied experience is crucial. Words do not just provide access to isolated prototypical contexts, but to conventionalised sequences of events in scripts. This thesis will show how ‘hunting’ and ‘lion attack’ scripts are used to understand distressing situations in Hebrew.
2.4.5. Reddy: The Conduit Metaphor
In 1979, Michael Reddy demonstrated even more conceptual structure implicit in various words by showing how the conduit metaphors used to problematise communication difficulties fail to reflect actual communication.131 The way we conventionally discuss communication both reveals how we habitually think about communication and constrains our inferences when it fails. Thus, conventional language does influence thought.

Using the conduit metaphor, communication is understood as a conduit carrying mental material (thoughts, ideas, or meanings) in containers (words or other media) from one person

27

to another. Linguistic expressions include: I couldn’t get much from Max’s paper; the paragraph was overloaded with meaning; Steve’s ideas don’t come across clearly in his writing. This fundamental metaphor constrains inferences regarding miscommunication. A prototypical conduit should work efficiently, so communication failures must be the communicator’s failure when loading their mental stuff into the container. A more accurate metaphor should acknowledge that miscommunications are ‘tendencies inherent in the system, which can only be counteracted by continuous effort and by large amounts of verbal interaction’.

Reddy showed that systematic metaphorical structuring in language could influence thinking. He is the direct precursor to Lakoff and Johnson’s conceptual metaphors, and the beginning of Cognitive Linguistics.132
2.5. The Cognitive Linguistics Paradigm
2.5.1. Lakoff and Johnson: Conceptual Metaphors and Image Schemas George Lakoff’s conceptual metaphors were introduced in his 1980 work with Mark Johnson, Metaphors We Live By. They acknowledge the influence of Sapir, Whorf, Wittgenstein, Schank, Fillmore and Rosch,133 creating a theory of language and thought that prioritises categorisation and metaphor.
a) Philosophical Basis Understanding Lakoff and Johnson requires comprehending their claims about metaphor,134 that ‘the essence of metaphor is understanding and experiencing one kind of thing in terms of another’.135 Thus, metaphor is located in thought and concerned with conceptualisation (hence conceptual metaphor) and how metaphors are expressed in language is less important

132 Cognitive Linguistics (capitalised) is conventionally used for Lakoff and Johnson’s strand of cognitive linguistics, Geeraerts, ‘Introduction’, 3.
133 Lakoff and Johnson, Metaphors, xi-xii. Reddy is recognised in Lakoff, ‘Contemporary’, 186-187.
134 Lakoff claims his view of metaphor differs radically from the classical tradition since Aristotle, which viewed metaphor as special language. More accurately, it challenges the prevailing approaches of the mid-twentieth century. For Aristotle’s actual view of metaphor, see J. E. Mahon, ‘Getting Your Sources Right: What Aristotle Didn't Say’ in L. Cameron and G. Low (eds.), Researching and Applying Metaphor (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 69-80.

28

for them. ‘Understanding’ here does not mean rational beliefs, but rather ‘our bodily, cultural, linguistic, historical situatedness in, and toward, our world’.136

Lakoff and Johnson then develop their framework upon three results of cognitive science.137 First, the mind is inherently embodied, so our thought processes are a result of our experiences of living in the world. Second, thought is largely unconscious, operating ‘too quickly to be focused on’.138 Lakoff and Johnson suggest 95% of thought is unconscious, and this shapes conscious thought.139 Meaning, then, is no longer just about conscious associations. This fits with Boasian emphases on unconscious categorisation in language, but also reopens the gate for irresponsible linguistics.140 If thought, and thus meaning, are largely unconscious, the analyst must avoid unchecked flights of fancy. Third, abstract thought is largely metaphorical. Not only is thought the locus for metaphor, but ‘metaphorical thought is unavoidable, ubiquitous, and mostly unconscious’.141 A person may thus ‘understand’ certain domains metaphorically through other domains without being consciously aware of it. These three results create a philosophical position Lakoff and Johnson term ‘experiential realism’,142 or more recently, ‘embodied realism’.143
b) Image Schemas and Gestalt Perception
If thought is largely metaphorical, what are these metaphors based on? Lakoff and Johnson’s solution lies in embodied experience, with two kinds of pre-conceptual (non-metaphorical) structures forming the basis for thought, specifically image schemas and gestalt perception.

First, image schemas are directly meaningful preconceptual structures emerging from our embodied experience of movement, perception and manipulation of objects.144 They have a
basic internal structure, as in the CONTAINER schema (structured with a boundary, interior
136 Johnson, Body, 138. 137 Lakoff and Johnson, Philosophy, 3-93. 138 Lakoff and Johnson, Philosophy, 10. 139 Lakoff and Johnson, Philosophy, 13. 140 This difficulty is acknowledged by several Cognitive Linguists, as in G. Fauconnier, Mappings in Thought and Language (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), 1-13, Gibbs, ‘Researching’. 141 Lakoff and Johnson, Metaphors, 272. 142 Lakoff, Women, 269-303. 143 Lakoff and Johnson, Philosophy, 74-93. 144 B. Hampe, ‘Image Schemas in Cognitive Linguistics: Introduction’ in B. Hampe (ed.), From Perception to Meaning: Image Schemas in Cognitive Linguistics (Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter, 2005), 1-12, 1.

29

and exterior) or the SOURCE-PATH-GOAL schema, deriving from bodily movement.145 Mark Johnson defined an image schema as ‘a recurring, dynamic pattern of our perceptual interactions and motor programs that gives coherence and structure to our experience’.146 Thus, the CONTAINER schema derives its existence and structure from experiencing our bodies as containers and moving our bodies in and out of other containers. They exist ‘beneath conscious awareness, prior to and independently of other concepts’,147 generalising individual mental images and integrating information from multiple modalities. Johnson represents schemas through line drawings, as in Figure 1, although realising this implies an unwarranted similarity between image schemas and rich images.148

Figure 1. A Representation of the CONTAINMENT Image Schema
The internal structure of such schemas constrains meaning. For example, in FORCE schemas, the internal structure of source, intensity, movement and barriers is used to ‘understand’ modal verbs. Thus, may as root modal (you may go to town) and as epistemic modal (he may have gone to town) both use an image schema with no barrier blocking forceful movement, whether in the physical domain or more abstractly where the movement is from premise to
145 These prototypical schemas are often used in place of a definition. However, schemas are still a useful and central concept in Cognitive Linguistics. See J. E. Grady, ‘Image Schemas and Perception: Refining a Definition’ in B. Hampe (ed.), From Perception to Meaning: Image Schemas in Cognitive Linguistics (Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter, 2005), 35-56. 146 Johnson, Body, xiv. Despite moves to extend or alter this definition, recent literature affirms Johnson’s original emphases on fundamental units of sensory experience, Grady, ‘Definition’. 147 Hampe, ‘Schemas’, 2. 148 Johnson, Body, 23.

conclusion.149 Here, embodied experiences of forces constrain our inferences in nonphysical domains.

Second, gestalt perception provides more preconceptual structure for Lakoff’s semantics, integrating frames and scripts, and being used for objects at Rosch’s basic level (section 2.4.2).150 Thus, recognising a dog rather than a cat is based on gestalt perception, psychologically recognising the whole object, rather than a complex sum of different features. Experiential gestalts are then ‘ways of organizing experiences into structured wholes’,151 with dimensions that emerge naturally in experience. Thus, a CONVERSATION is an experiential gestalt, and image schemas themselves are highly schematic gestalts.152 Experiential gestalts tend to have structural elements including: participants; parts combining to form a whole; stages; linear sequence; causation; and purpose.

Lakoff and Johnson illustrate experiential gestalts with CONVERSATION, ARGUMENT and WAR, each perceived as a structured whole with participants acting in prototypical ways through a sequence of stages to achieve their purposes. Actual experience is perceived relative to these gestalts. Demonstrating how metaphor uses these gestalts, they discuss two people talking. They may impose the CONVERSATION gestalt on their experience, but if through the words used some dimensions begin to fit the STRUGGLE gestalt (such as seeing the participants as opponents, or the interaction as verbal aggression), and they hold the conceptual metaphor ARGUMENT IS STRUGGLE, the experience may begin to be perceived as fitting the ARGUMENT gestalt instead, so that they see themselves as having an ‘argument’.153 This thesis shows, for example, how an experiential gestalt of SIEGE structures experiences of DISTRESS, mapping onto the purpose, participants (the self, God and ‘enemies’) and sequence of events, when someone holds the metaphor BEING IN DISTRESS IS BEING UNDER SIEGE.

c) Conceptual Metaphor
It has been established that image schemas and perceptual gestalts have structure. Structure is then mapped through metaphor from these two types of source domains onto experiences (target domains) lacking their own discernible preconceptual structure.154 Thus, the simplystructured SOURCE-PATH-GOAL schema is mapped to the ‘journey’ of life to evaluate ‘progress’, where some ‘get ahead’ while others are ‘left behind’. Similarly, THE MIND IS A MACHINE metaphor maps structure from our gestalt perception of machines (movement, efficiency, component parts) to question whether someone is ‘functioning’ properly or has ‘a screw loose’.

A basic way of importing structure is through primary metaphor, where distinct domains (such as ‘affection’ and ‘warmth’) are conflated during a person’s infancy through repeated correlation in experience, creating co-activation patterns in different parts of the brain’s neural network, ‘wiring together’ the two domains. Primary metaphors include MORE IS UP, SEEING IS KNOWING, DIFFICULTIES ARE BURDENS and HAPPY IS UP. These metaphors form unconsciously and automatically, so are as universally acquired as the embodied experiences they reflect are universal experiences.155

Lakoff and Johnson contend that metaphorical mappings primarily create similarities, rather than reflecting pre-existing similarities (as in comparison theories).156 Correlations in experience do not require any intrinsic similarity between two domains; the similarities are created by mapping structure from one domain to another. Thus, a complex concept is usually partially structured by different metaphors that are somewhat inconsistent with each other, each highlighting certain aspects of the target domain and hiding others, as in the English metaphors AN ARGUMENT IS A CONTAINER (that can be ‘empty’) and AN ARGUMENT IS A JOURNEY (that can ‘lose its way’).157
d) Idealised Cognitive Models
These structures and processes produce a cognitive semantics resulting in idealised cognitive models (ICMs) through which we organise knowledge, handle concepts and construct

32

categories. Each ICM is a gestalt and produces various prototype effects, as when their idealised structure fits experience to varying degrees. Thus, a bachelor is not defined simply through necessary and sufficient conditions (unmarried, adult, male), but relative to an ICM including a society with heterosexual marriage occurring at a typical age. Whether Tarzan or the Pope is a bachelor then becomes a problem of how well this ICM fits the world. The worse the fit, the less appropriate it is to apply the concept.158

An ICM may have intrinsic structure (propositional or image-schematic) or receive structure from metaphoric or metonymic mappings.159 First, metaphoric mappings map structure from propositional or image-schematic models to other domains. For example, the BALANCE image schema (from maintaining bodily equilibriums) maps structure to emotions and psychology. A well-balanced individual is stable and keeps emotions on an even keel.160 Similarly, the source domain of STRUGGLE structures arguments, with claims ‘defended’, positions ‘surrendered’ and participants as ‘opponents’. These structured, metaphorical mappings exist in thought, producing systematic conventional metaphors in language. Therefore, analysis of conventional linguistic metaphors reveals the mental mappings. As with communication ‘conduits’, the entailments of these mappings constrain the way the target domain is thought about, problematised, and acted upon. Second, metonymic mappings map structure from one element of an ICM to another within the same ICM. Traditionally, metonymy refers to linguistic expressions where a word is substituted by an associated one, as in 10 Downing Street has yet to respond, where 10 Downing Street stands for the Prime Minister. However, just as locating metaphor in thought redefines linguistic metaphor, so does locating metonymy in the mind. Cognitive Linguistics links metaphor and metonymy in a simple formulation: whereas metaphor maps between different domains, metonymy maps within the same domain.161 Metonymic mappings are used when a concept is understood through a particular instantiation, and produce many prototype effects, as seen in the different uses of social stereotypes, typical examples, ideal examples and salient examples.162

e) Further Evidence for Conceptual Metaphor
Lakoff advocated empirical research to support his hypotheses about metaphorical thought. The strands of evidence increased from two in 1980 to nine by 2003.163

First, Lakoff stresses generalisations over polysemy, where several words have senses in two domains. Thus, seethe, fume, explode and simmer all describe heated fluids, but also human anger. This systematic polysemy demonstrates a conceptual link between anger and heated fluids, a link rarely mentioned in dictionaries. In Metaphors We Live By this was the primary evidence, with conceptual metaphors being ‘proved’ by a few sentences incorporating such systematic polysemy.

Second, inference patterns show reasoning in abstract domains based on inferences from more concrete domains, implying a conceptual mapping between them. For example, if someone explodes, they may have been simmering for a long time, but keeping a lid on it. These inference patterns offer generalisations when reasoning in one domain (heating a fluid in a container) is systematically used for reasoning in another domain (anger).

Third, extensions to novel examples show conceptual metaphors are indeed ‘alive’, though entrenched in conventional vocabulary. More Than Cool Reason claims poets extend, elaborate, question or conflate conventional metaphors, rather than creating totally new ones,164 as when Hamlet extends DEATH IS SLEEP to include dreaming, by asking, ‘What dreams may come?’

Fourth, generalisations over historical semantic change provide evidence, as in perception verbs which developed figurative meanings with remarkable consistency across IndoEuropean languages and beyond.165 Verbs of seeing became metaphors for knowledge, verbs

163 Lakoff and Johnson, Metaphors, 246-249. 164 Lakoff and Turner, Reason, 67-72. 165 Sweetser, Etymology.

Chapter 2: Culture, Language and Thought

34

of hearing for internal receptivity, verbs of touch for emotions and verbs of taste for personal preference.166

Fifth, psychological evidence comes from Ray Gibbs’ experiments, detailed in section 2.5.6 below.

Sixth, gestures ‘often trace out images from the source domains of conceptual metaphors’,167 as when moving hands like scales when talking about choices, reflecting a CHOOSING IS WEIGHING conceptual metaphor.

Seventh, discourse studies show conceptual metaphors needed to make coherent sense of connected utterances. Eighth, sign languages may reflect conceptual metaphors. For example, the sign for past may indicate the area behind a speaker, reflecting the metaphor that the past is behind.168

Finally, childhood language acquisition shows children learn conceptual metaphors in a conflated form when source and target domains appear together, and only later differentiate. For example, they learn SEEING IS KNOWING when they ‘see’ and ‘know’ something simultaneously (as in ‘See, Daddy’s home’) and only later use ‘see’ without a visible stimulus (as in ‘See what I mean?’). Significantly, this suggests humans acquire more abstract senses of polysemous words later than physical senses, contrary to Barr’s contention that physical senses should not be privileged.
f) Linguistic Relativity
For Lakoff, relativity in thought, and therefore also in language, arises from two areas. Firstly, varying basic experience produces varying preconceptual structures. Bodily experiences of ‘containing’ food may be universal, but other experiences depend on

166 Ibarretxe-Antuñano also investigates smell, I. Ibarretxe-Antuñano, ‘Metaphorical Mappings in the Sense of Smell’ in R. W. Gibbs, Jr. and G. J. Steen (eds.), Metaphor in Cognitive Linguistics

168 Other gesture research supports the existence of image schemas and conceptual metaphors, as in A. Cienki, ‘Image Schemas and Gesture’ in B. Hampe (ed.), From Perception to Meaning: Image Schemas in Cognitive Linguistics (Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter, 2005), 395-420.

35

geography and culture. Thus, for the mountain-dwelling Cora people basic hill shape is a ‘fundamental aspect of their constant experience’.169 As a result, rather than culture giving a conceptual overlay to experience, ‘we experience our “world” in such a way that our culture is already present in the very experience itself’.170

Second, basic experiences may overlap but motivate different conceptual systems. For example, orientations like up-down may be universal image schemas, but which concepts are oriented which way varies across cultures.171

Thus, Lakoff substantially agrees with Whorf, but places more emphasis on metaphor, dissolving Whorf’s distinction between habitual thought and metaphor, and claiming metaphorical thought is universal, so that Whorf’s analysis of Hopi needs re-evaluation.
2.5.2. Langacker and Taylor: Cognitive Grammar
Ronald Langacker developed a new ‘cognitive’ grammar, again utilising Wittgenstein, Rosch, Fillmore and Schank’s ideas, prioritising psychologically real processes (particularly imagery) over his contemporaries’ mathematical formalism. Langacker’s Foundations of Cognitive Grammar is still the core text for Cognitive Linguistics, focusing on appropriate methodology, principles and assumptions, to create an ‘open’ text to be filled out by others.172 Langacker and Lakoff (with Leonard Talmy) are the most influential Cognitive Linguists,173 but form two schools: the ‘Berkeley’ school following Lakoff (concentrating on the centrality of metaphor to thought) and the ‘San Diego’ school around Langacker (investigating the interface between thought and grammar in every area of linguistics).174

For Langacker, metaphor results from the foundational cognitive process of establishing correspondences,175 and is thus constitutive of mental life, not peripheral to it.176 In mental
169 Lakoff, Women, 310. 170 Lakoff and Johnson, Metaphors, 57. 171 Lakoff and Johnson, Metaphors, 24. 172 Taylor, Grammar, 40. 173 Geeraerts, ‘Introduction’, 24. 174 P. Werth, Text Worlds: Representing Conceptual Space in Discourse (Harlow: Longman, 1999), 42. 175 R. Langacker, Foundations of Cognitive Grammar: Volume 1, Theoretical Prerequisites (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1987), 90-96.

36

categorisation, such correspondences may reflect schematicity (the ability to conceive an entity at various levels, such as being a tree, an oak and a sessile oak), or comparison with a prototype (such as recognising a palm as a tree). The mind continually makes comparisons and this ability ‘underlies the detection of regularity and imposition of structure on cognitive activity’.177

Thus, Langacker’s lexical semantics complements Metaphors and can be used in this thesis. It emphasises an encyclopaedic approach to meaning and schematic networks, to which linguistic expressions provide points of access.
a) Encyclopaedic Knowledge
First, Langacker advocates an encyclopaedic view of semantics, with all the information a speaker knows about an entity legitimately belonging to the meaning of a lexeme referring to it.178 Further, there is a graded scale, with certain specifications more entrenched through conventional usage, and thus more accessible in a usage event. Which specifications are salient depends on the speaker’s individual exposure to language and on an utterance’s context. As an example, Langacker explains how ‘the cat is on the mat’ could be easily understood at the climax of a tiger-wrestling competition:
It is not that the expression intrinsically holds or conveys the contextual meaning, but rather, that conventional units sanction this meaning as falling within the open-ended class of conceptualizations they motivate through judgments of full or partial schematicity. These conceptualizations may draw on any facet of a speaker’s conceptual universe.179
This conceptual universe is modelled (simplistically) as a knowledge system consisting of a network of nodes (corresponding to different domains) and arcs representing relationships between them. Lexical units afford points of access to these knowledge networks.
b) Schematic Networks
Second, this encyclopaedic approach links Langacker’s schematic networks to lexical semantics,180 describing polysemy and homonymy through the complex category created by using the same word for a network of different conceptualisations. Schematic networks

demonstrate, in an ideal situation, both prototypical specifications for a word and the highest level abstract schematisation covering all instantiations. For example, a (British) child may first acquire the concept [TREE] through generalising typical deciduous trees, such as oaks or sycamores, forming a prototypical sense for the category tree. Later, discovering pine trees with different leaves, the child creates [TREE´], an abstract schematisation allowing both pines and deciduous trees as elaborations. Later still, the schematic concept [TREE´´] is formed when the child discovers palms are also trees. As the category grows by extension from the prototype, an abstraction process forms increasingly ‘fuzzy’ schemas compatible with the new category, containing only sufficient detail to cover the various elaborations. This schematic network is represented in Figure 2:181

In general, the nodes in a lexical network provide alternate ‘windows’ on a knowledge system. In a specific usage, a speaker ‘activates a particular node that approximates the notion he wishes to convey’,182 which also facilitates the activation of linked nodes. The nodes and links vary in cognitive salience, with prominent domains (such as visual and spatial), or particularly entrenched senses, being most salient.

c) Linguistic Relativity
Langacker agrees with Whorf that we impose structure on the flux of impressions in the world, and that ‘it is our conception of reality (not the real world per se) that is relevant to linguistic semantics’.183 Still, Langacker thinks cognitive grammar is useful for describing universals. However, rather than seeking universal syntactic features to deduce universal mental properties (as Chomsky had done), Langacker uses universal mental processes (such as acquiring categories through lived experience, by extensions from prototypes and generalisations to form schemas) to formulate potential language universals.
d) Taylor’s Cognitive Grammar Taylor’s Cognitive Grammar (2002) mostly restates Langacker’s theory, supporting Langacker’s encyclopaedic conception of knowledge, and incorporating conceptual metaphor theory.

First, Taylor experimentally supports Langacker’s claim that words are highly flexible points of access to multiple domains, variously activated in different contexts. For example, the young man lifted the piano was recalled when cued with heavy, whereas the young man played the piano was not. Both were recalled when cued with music, showing the music domain is more central to conventional conceptions of a piano than its weight, which is only activated in certain contexts.184 Other psychological research confirms that a word’s senses are not ‘things’ but creative processes accessing various domains in different contexts.

Meanings only seem stable because ‘most uses of the word will serve to highlight a recurring configuration of conceptual knowledge’,185 entrenching these uses and making the domains

they activate more salient. Thus the Hebrew word

may provide varying access to

domains of enclosing and constraining in different contexts.

Second, Taylor integrates conceptual metaphors with schematic networks,186 suggesting conceptual metaphors like CONCLUSIONS ARE DESTINATIONS are schematic for linguistic

39

expressions like ‘we reached a conclusion’, abstracting the commonalities of two domains. Johnson’s image schemas and Talmy’s force dynamics are also then schematic notions.187

Understanding conceptual metaphors as schemas provides a framework for discussing a metaphor’s productivity. Schemas are salient to the extent they are entrenched through a large number of instances. Similarly, a conceptual metaphor’s productivity can be categorised by speakers’ abilities ‘to create a large (and open-ended) set of expressions which instantiate the metaphor’,188 revealed in the number of differently worded linguistic expressions. Further, comparing with the schema and instance treatment of complex morphology, Taylor contends that ‘if we find that a metaphor can be creatively elaborated, by bringing in various aspects from the source domain, we can be confident that the source domain is active in the expression’s use’.189 In this thesis, variety in syntactic expression will be investigated to demonstrate the productivity of conceptual metaphors like DISTRESS IS CONSTRAINT, and extra elements introduced from the source domain will be taken as evidence of active cognitive links.
2.5.3. Talmy: Force Dynamic Patterns
Leonard Talmy’s force dynamics190 parallels Johnson’s image schemas, and provides a potential universal structure for analysing emotion.191 Force dynamic patterns concern how entities forcefully interact, including ‘the exertion of force, resistance to such a force, the overcoming of such a resistance, blockage of the expression of force, removal of such blockage, and the like’.192 They offer a significant generalising principle for understanding language structure,193 especially causation, but also psychological and social interactions, modals194 and argumentation within discourse.195

Talmy argues that we frequently frame situations linguistically by attributing forces to the entities involved, even though not scientifically justified. For example, saying ‘the ball kept on rolling’ gives the ball a force tendency to movement, overcoming some other force seeking to stop it. Here, ‘one force-exerting entity is singled out for focal attention – the salient issue in the interaction is whether this entity is able to manifest its force tendency or, on the contrary, is overcome’.196 The focal entity is the Agonist, having a tendency to either movement or rest; the entity seeking to overcome it is the Antagonist.

In the interaction, either may prove stronger. This gives four scenarios: the Antagonist overcomes the Agonist’s tendency, making it move or rest (against its tendency), or, conversely, the Agonist prevails against the Antagonist and manifests its tendency, to move or rest. For causation, these reflect the English difference between ‘making’ something happen (when the Antagonist prevails) and ‘letting’ something happen (when the Antagonist fails). Although these four basic situations can be made more complex, Talmy identifies a prototype force-dynamic interaction that limits the linguistic system, of ‘a stronger force opposing a weaker force head on, with all-or-none conditions’.197 Thus force interactions in language involve two forces rather than three or more, a constant Agonist force, rather than one that varies, a tendency in the Agonist only to rest or movement, and a two-valued resultant state for the Agonist, either action or rest.

As with image schemas, force dynamics are grounded in an ‘understanding system’ underlying commonsense conceptions and sophisticated reasoning, but diverging from the results of contemporary science. For example, privileging one entity within an interaction, or ascribing to it a force tendency, have no counterpart in physical theory, nor do the notions of blocking, letting, resistance or overcoming. This discrepancy between science and naïve models leaves linguistic relativity open. If the ascription of force to entities is a matter of folk rather than scientific theory, and much of our conception of causality is based on such attribution, there is the possibility of different conceptualisations across languages. As Talmy only considers English data, this avenue is not explored.

2.5.4. Fauconnier: Mappings and Integration
Gilles Fauconnier’s contributes a theory of ‘mental spaces’ and mappings between them.198 He contends that ‘mappings between domains are at the heart of the unique human cognitive faculty of producing, transferring and processing meaning’,199 so that ‘the simplest meanings are not simple at all. They rely on remarkable cognitive mapping capacities, immense arrays of intricately pre-structured knowledge, and exceptional on-line creativity’.200

Writing on conceptual integration, the evolution of conceptual systems that include crossdomain (metaphorical) mappings, he concludes that the source domain remains accessible ‘at any time to provide further vocabulary and, more important, new ideas for dealing with the target’ as long as a word continues to be used in both domains, so the mapping is ‘linguistically transparent’. 201 This holds from the start of conceptual integration when an analogy is first made, through to cases of motivated polysemy (where source and target domains become increasingly distinguished). A word apparently applying directly in both domains (like a computer virus) ‘does not sever the link between the original source domain and the target or diminish the importance of the source as an archetype for some abstract properties of the target’.202 Rather, the synchronic conception of the vocabulary changes, so that speakers feel they are not talking about target domain entities ‘as if’ they were in the source domain, but that terms from the source domain can be used to speak of them (as possibly in the Hebrew description of other participants in distress as ‘enemies’). By now, the mapping may be less consciously noticeable, but ‘more available than ever for reasoning, inference transfers, and conceptual elaborations’.203 Conceptual links only disappear when the source domain changes vocabulary, so that, for example, ‘idea’ no longer has conceptual links to sight because the Greek idein ‘see’ is no longer used in the domain of vision.

2.5.5. Wierzbicka: Natural Semantic Metalanguage
Although critical of Lakoff,204 Anna Wierzbicka works within a broadly Cognitive Linguistic paradigm, recognising the profound impact of language on thought, but also claiming meaningful universalism. Her approach is summarised as ‘Universal Human Concepts in Culture-Specific Configurations’205 and derives from Cartesian foundationalism, assuming certain unanalysable, basic concepts (or semantic primitives) that are, moreover, ‘universal words’ present in all languages. Thus ‘universal words stand for universal human concepts, that is, the universal building blocks of human thought’,206 and can be used to paraphrase more complex concepts, permitting translation and cross-cultural communication.

Wierzbicka has sought to elucidate these primitives, constructing a ‘Natural Semantic Metalanguage’ for cross-linguistic comparisons. In 1992, it contained around 30 words: I, you, someone, something, this, say, want, no, feel, think, know, where, good, when, can, like, the same, kind of, after, do, happen, bad, all, because, if, two, part, become, imagine and world.207 By 2002, the list contained some 60 items.208 Importantly, these primitives are not metaphorical, since ‘the meaning of metaphors … can be explained in non-metaphorical language’.209 This clearly opposes Lakoff and Johnson, who claim the mind is inherently and foundationally metaphorical.210

Wierzbicka emphasises prototypes in semantic description, with word ‘definitions’ written in her semantic metalanguage being cultural prototypes rather than necessary and sufficient conditions. These prototypes enable comparison of concepts like friendship, understanding of the self, or emotions across different cultures. She prioritises individual words (rather than

210 Lakoff’s approach is preferred. Wierzbicka actually unconsciously uses her primitives metaphorically, as when she uses ‘something’ to refer to an event (‘do something bad’), not a concrete entity, Wierzbicka, Sermon, 6-7.

sentences) as access points to concepts, focusing on key words in different languages.211 Thus, although the absence of a word does not mean a speaker cannot form a concept, ‘the presence of a word proves the presence of the concept, and, moreover, its salience in a given culture’.212 She has been criticised for having too monolithic a view of language and culture here,213 but replies that ‘language – and in particular, vocabulary – is the best evidence of the reality of “culture”, in the sense of a historically transmitted system of “conceptions” and attitudes’.214

For emotion language specifically, words are important since
the way people interpret their own emotions depends, to some extent at least, on the lexical grid provided by their native language … whether or not two feelings are interpreted as two different instances of, essentially, ‘the same emotion’ or as instances of ‘two different emotions’ depends largely on the language through the prism of which these emotions are interpreted.215
Whilst this is undoubtedly valid, it excludes almost all the data in this thesis, since it ‘ignores the important fact that talk about the emotions does not require that the emotions be named’.216 It is possible to express depression without explicitly saying, ‘I am depressed’, and it is this discourse this thesis investigates. Thus, this research follows Wierzbicka in taking vocabulary seriously, but uses biblical form criticism to define a wider set of linguistic expressions (discussed in 3.3.1 and 3.3.2.b), where the experience may not be explicitly named, that can be used to study the conceptualisation of distress.

metaphorical knowledge motivates people’s use and understanding of ordinary and literary language’.217

Gibbs desires to clarify the role of metaphor within thought and language, offering four hypotheses as to how figurative thought may influence ordinary language use and understanding:

Hypothesis one:

Metaphoric thought might play some role in changing the meanings of words and expressions over time, but does not motivate contemporary speakers' use and understanding of language.

Hypothesis two:

Metaphoric thought might motivate the linguistic meanings that have currency within linguistic communities, or may have some role in an idealised speaker/hearer's understanding of language. But metaphoric thought does not actually play any part in individual speakers' ability to make sense of, or process, language.

Hypothesis three: Metaphoric thought might motivate individual speakers' use and understanding of why various words and expressions mean what they do, but does not play any role in people's ordinary on-line production or comprehension of everyday language.

Hypothesis four: Metaphoric thought might function automatically and interactively in people’s on-line use and understanding of linguistic meaning.218

James Barr’s emphasis on separate semantic histories following metaphorical transference suggests he assumed hypothesis one, so that metaphoric thought does not occur when a polysemous word is used with a figurative sense. By contrast, Lakoff risks uncritically assuming hypothesis four, with linguistic metaphors providing direct access to ‘on-line’ metaphoric thought. Gibbs’ psycholinguistic evidence confirms at least hypothesis three, and possibly (though not conclusively) hypothesis four.

a) No ‘Literal’ Meanings
First, Gibbs attacks ‘literal’ meanings,219 concluding ‘there is no stable account of literality for either concepts or language’.220 If ‘literality’ cannot be defined, the mind cannot process information in a predominantly ‘literal’ way, and handling of ‘literal’ versus ‘figurative’ language cannot be contrasted. Rather, the mind works in an inherently poetic way. Following Reddy, words are not containers of meaning but ways of accessing highly interconnected networks, requiring an encyclopaedic approach to knowledge, and suggesting that concepts are ‘temporary constructions in working memory constructed on the spot from generic and episodic information in long-term memory rather than … stable structures stored in long-term memory’.221

Next, Gibbs investigates any special process for understanding figurative language. Reaction times for comprehension of ‘figurative’ or ‘literal’ language show no differences, given an adequate contextual background, suggesting the mind processes both similarly, constructing meaning against the conceptual background and common knowledge of speaker and hearer. All the evidence contradicts the idea that figurative language requires a three stage process of understanding (literal processing, recognition of anomaly, and figurative processing).
b) Metaphor Comprehension
Gibbs clarifies what does happen in understanding figurative language. At different time scales, it may involve comprehension, recognition that an utterance is an example of figurative language, interpretation of the utterance, and appreciation as to whether it is a good or bad example. Comprehension comes first and relates to the process of understanding, the other three relate to the product of this process. Many theories of understanding figurative language confuse these stages of understanding. Any metaphor theory has to accept no difference between ‘literal’ and metaphorical language for the time taken in the earliest stages of comprehension. This rules out comparison, substitution, ‘loose talk’, anomaly, speech act and most interaction views of metaphor in their handling of this

stage of understanding, as all require extra processing for the early comprehension of figurative language, whether in identifying that communicative norms have been broken, creating new interactions between source and target domains or substituting literal meanings.222 The only solution is the conceptual structure view, with both figurative and ‘literal’ language relying on similar pre-existing structures, so that there must be a preexisting ‘constrained set of conceptual mappings, itself metaphorical, that structures our thinking, reasoning and understanding’.223 Only this approach allows us to understand metaphorical utterances before we even realise they are metaphorical.
c) Poetic Metaphor
Gibbs sees literary metaphors as special instantiations of shared conceptual metaphors. For example, when subjects shared their thoughts as they read love poetry, they used the same conventional figurative expressions (based on conceptual metaphors) identified in another experiment where participants defined love and described their experiences of it. Thus, the interpretation of poetic literature is constrained by ordinary metaphorical mappings, rather than creating novel ones. Gibbs concludes that ‘the vast majority of novel metaphors in poetry and literature reflect fixed patterns of metaphorical mappings between dissimilar source and target domains’.224 This is a significant empirical result for this project, which analyses literary texts.
d) Idiom Comprehension and Image Schemas
Idioms show further that conceptual metaphors constrain thought. People’s mental images for the conventional expressions ‘blow your stack’, ‘hit the ceiling’ and ‘flip your lid’ shared many similarities, whereas images for ‘blow your tire’, ‘hit the wall’ and ‘flip your hat’ were more varied. This suggests a constraining conceptual metaphor, in which internal pressure causes a substance to move upwards in a violent manner, linking the idioms to their figurative meanings. Elsewhere, Gibbs showed that cognitive topology (relationships within a domain) transferred from source to target domain for idioms. When questioned about causation, intentionality and manner when a sealed container explodes, most participants agreed it was due to internal pressure, was not the intention of the container, and would be violent. Other participants considered anger idioms like ‘blow your stack’ and again

Chapter 2: Culture, Language and Thought

47

understood the cause to be internal pressure, resulting in violent and unintentional behaviour. Thus, non-trivial aspects of the source domain may be preserved in idioms.225
Other research supports the psychological reality of image schemas as ‘the essential glue that binds embodied experience, thought, and language’,226 demonstrated by studies on how the mind represents momentum, on childhood development and on the relationship between stimuli in different modalities. In each area the mind apparently uses image schemas deriving from recurring bodily experience.227
e) Metaphor and Culture
Gibbs argues cognition is not just located in the head, but distributed into the wider cultural system. Thus, image-schemas and basic body experiences are themselves complex, and varying, social and cultural constructions. Although containment, for example, is universal, ‘scholars should look extensively at people’s social / cultural experiences of embodied containment, such as what causes people to move in and out of containers [and] how the escape of fluids from different containers is socially understood’.228 Here, this means Hebrew embodied experiences of containment are significant for metaphor comprehension.

2.5.7. Kövecses: Emotion and Cultural Variation
Zoltán Kövecses makes several relevant contributions. First, he has empirically investigated conceptual metaphors behind linguistic expressions found in various corpora, offering practical methodologies for this thesis. Second, he has researched emotions and relationships,229 similar domains to Hebrew distress language, so he offers some of the best comparative examples. Third, Kövecses relates conceptual metaphors to conceptual metonymies. Fourth, he has increasingly considered cultural influences on conceptual metaphor,230 investigating cross-cultural variation.231

a) Research Methodology
First, Kövecses’ methodology typically involves collecting linguistic metaphors from specific corpora, classifying into groups according to source domains and then quantifying which conceptual metaphors are instantiated most frequently. For example, one project used a selection of romantic novels to discover metaphoric conceptualisations for ‘lust’ and then tabulated results. In another, magazine articles in Hungarian and English were read to find out how emotions were conceptualised in both languages. These methods provide prototypes for this thesis.

Kövecses has also developed analytical tools to describe how source domains are used to conceptualise target domains. These include the scope of a metaphor and its main meaning focus.232 The scope of a metaphor is the full range of target domains, to which a specific source concept applies.233 Across this range, there are often main meaning foci for the source domain, being culturally predetermined conceptual materials, which are contributed to the target domains.234 For example, building metaphors used to structure arguments, relationships, theories or careers all focus on the creation and stability of the target domain’s complex system. Similarly, fire and heat in English focus particularly on ‘intensity’, whichever target domain they conceptualise.
b) Emotion Metaphors
Kövecses’ most well-known study concerns the English conceptualisation of anger,235 using conventional expressions to identify the main conceptual metaphors, such as ANGER IS AN OPPONENT, ANGER IS A DANGEROUS ANIMAL and (most significantly) ANGER IS A HEATED FLUID IN A CONTAINER. The different parts of the experience which these domains highlight create a prototypical scenario236 for anger in American culture, involving five stages: offending event; anger; attempted control; loss of control; and act of retribution. ANGER IS A DANGEROUS ANIMAL, for example, highlights the stages of ‘loss of control’ and ‘act of retribution’ (as in ‘he unleashed his anger’, ‘she bit his head off’). Against this prototypical

49

scenario, non-prototypical cases stand out, such as successful control, or insatiable anger (where anger remains despite retribution).

Kövecses also investigated other basic-level emotions, including happiness, love and sadness, discovering some source domains only used for certain emotions (such as FEAR IS A HIDDEN ENEMY or SHAME IS A DECREASE IN SIZE). However, many applied to most emotion concepts: containers; natural and physical forces; social superiors; opponents or captive animals; a divided self; burdens; and illness. Other domains associated with more than one emotion included heat, light-dark, up-down, economic value, nutrient, war, hunger, and physical damage.237 Many of these metaphors can be considered as instantiations of the master (more schematic) metaphor that EMOTIONS ARE FORCES.238

Kövecses suspects that conceptualising emotions as forces is a language universal arising from physiological experiences. Cultural variation arises from such general schemas being ‘filled out in diverse ways with specific cultural material’.239 Concentrating on lexical items at the expense of conventional figurative language (as in Wierzbicka’s work240) misses these bodily based universals.241
c) Conceptual Metonymy
Following Lakoff, Kövecses sees conceptual metonymy as ‘a cognitive process in which one conceptual entity, the vehicle, provides mental access to another conceptual entity, the target, within the same idealised cognitive model’.242 Focusing on emotions, this allows for conceptual metonymies like THE PHYSIOLOGICAL AND EXPRESSIVE RESPONSES OF AN EMOTION STAND FOR THE EMOTION,243 a schematic metonymy encompassing instances such

as BODY HEAT STANDS FOR ANGER seen in linguistic expressions like Billy’s a hothead.244 Kövecses argues that such conceptual metonymies motivate more elaborate conceptual metaphors, like ANGER IS A HEATED FLUID IN A CONTAINER.245 Others show that a metonymic basis for metaphor accounts for the experiential basis of many metaphors, suggesting a universal phenomenon,246 thus this thesis investigates possible Hebrew metonymic motivations for metaphor.
d) Metaphor and Culture
In Metaphor in Culture, Kövecses analyses universality and variation in conceptual metaphors. Specifically, Kövecses compares American English, Hungarian, Chinese, Japanese, and to a lesser extent Wolof (spoken in West Africa), Zulu (spoken in South Africa), Polish, the language of the Ifaluk (spoken in Micronesia247) and Chagga (spoken in Tanzania). In the first seven languages, pressurized containers map onto the domain of anger. Usually, heat is the source of the pressure.248 This universal conceptualisation across such varied languages suggests universal embodied experiences (presumably increase in skin temperature and blood pressure) rather than linguistic borrowing. Thus, there may be several potentially universal conceptual metaphors (including anger as pressure).

However, when these generic metaphors are culturally instantiated, variation emerges. First, some variation relates to understanding of the source and target domains, and of the mapping between them. Source domains may have a different scope in different cultures (mapping onto a different set of target domains) or target domains may have a different ‘range’ (a different set of source domains used for conceptualisation). Sometimes the range is very

similar, but certain domains are preferred in different cultures.249 For example, although Americans and Hungarians both use the metaphors LIFE IS WAR and LIFE IS A GAME, the former was most commonly used by Hungarians and the latter by Americans, with the alternative conceptualisation much less frequent.

Even where the same source domain is used, variation may result from the source domain’s construal (as in spatial motion, where English verbs like march or run encode manner whereas Turkish do not) or cultural prototypes (as in the metaphor SOCIETY IS A FAMILY, where it matters whether the prototypical family is dominated by a ‘strict father’ or is a place for ‘nurturing’ one another).250 Metaphors may also map different elements from source to target, or produce different entailments. For example, pouring water on someone’s anger to ‘extinguish’ it is a conventional entailment of ANGER IS FIRE in Zulu, but not in English.

Second, linguistic expressions for a shared conceptual metaphor may vary across cultures: in the degree of elaboration (the variety of expressions instantiating a particular conceptual metaphor); the kinds of linguistic expression used (whether words, multiword phrases or more complex syntactic constructions); the degree of conventionalisation; and the degree of transparency.251 These variations stem from either differential experience or differential cognitive preferences or styles.252 Different experience may come from a different physical, social or cultural context, or from a different cultural memory. Different cognitive preferences may be seen in different cultures focusing on different aspects of universal physiological experience (for example pressure or heat in the experience of anger), in the cultural prototypes for specific domains, or in a preference for metonymic over metaphoric conceptualisation (or vice versa).
e) Language and Thought
Kövecses distinguishes conventionalised metaphors within a language (the ‘supraindividual’ level) from those activated within the heads of individual speakers (the ‘individual’ level). Thus, ‘it is not the case that all the mappings arrived at by cognitive linguists at the supraindividual level are activated by individual speakers in the course of on-line thinking

52

and communication in the real world’.253 However, he remains positive about using language to discover how the mind works, noting that the main patterns that ‘emerge from the study of language characterize ... other (non-linguistic) types of manifestation of the mind as well’ suggesting that ‘language can be taken to be a fairly reliable instrument in identifying general conceptual patterns and that the general conceptual patterns that we find give us a fairly good clue to what is going on in the mind’.254 However, the emphasis on individual experience within a culture puts Kövecses a long way from Whorf’s determinism. Alternative conceptualisations are possible and ubiquitous.

2.5.8. Deignan: Metaphor and Corpus Research
Finally for this survey, Alice Deignan investigates metaphors in large corpora,255 demonstrating that figurative uses of a word may still evoke a physical mental image, even though never used in a physical sense within the corpus. Thus, lack of a concrete usage within the biblical corpus does not necessarily mean a word no longer generated an image from the physical domain.

For example, of 1000 random instances of shoulder, Deignan found 47 were verbal, 39 of which suggested responsibility, as in shouldering a wide variety of risks. This evokes ‘an image of a person carrying a heavy load on their shoulders; the load is the metaphor for their responsibility, and the verb shoulder is a metaphor for taking on or coping with this responsibility’.256 However, only two uses described a physical situation, and those described pushing through a crowd. Thus, although the mental image of physically lifting a heavy weight onto the shoulders seems a perfectly reasonable background for the metaphorical use, such physical usage did not occur. For the noun shoulder, the physical sense far outweighed the ‘responsibility’ sense (828 to 31), so the form shoulder still primarily evokes a physical entity. However, lack of a physical context amongst the occurrences in one part of speech (here, verbs) does not preclude a physical mental image, especially if physical usage is still current in another part of speech. Thus, even if the Bible only shows a root having a physical sense in one part of speech and only more abstract senses in another, the physical

mental image may still be evoked by both. Specifically, although the nominal

found for abstract ‘trouble’, this is insufficient evidence to preclude a mental image of constraint, as found in the physical contexts for the verb .

2.5.9. Cognitive Linguistics and the Legacy of James Barr
So, does Cognitive Linguistics face Barr’s critique any better than its Whorfian predecessors? This section applies Barr’s concerns in Semantics to Cognitive Linguistics.

First, Barr warned against simply correlating language structure and thought structure, pleading for an approach from general linguistics. Cognitive Linguistics has developed within mainstream linguistics and moves beyond the simplicity of identifying linguistic structure and thought structure. However, it is optimistic that language provides generally reliable access to cognitive processes, based on convergent cross-linguistic research across psychology, linguistics and anthropology, contrasting with Barr’s emphasis on the unmotivated link between language and thought structures. Correlated language structure and thought structure is assumed, with many Cognitive Linguists adopting the ‘Cognitive Wager’, that linguistic constraints are most likely general to other cognitive processes, and others should prove otherwise.257 The difference between Barr and Cognitive Linguistics is partly one of emphasis. For Barr, since some linguistic structure derives from purely formrelated phenomena (like Indo-European gender arising from an accent system258), semantic explanations should not be privileged. For Cognitive Linguistics, since much linguistic structure is explainable through general cognitive processes (such as comparison and salience), explanations in terms of ‘thought structure’ should be considered first.

For example, Lakoff’s discussion of the Japanese noun classifier hon259 and Barr’s discussion of grammatical gender both examine those nouns united by a common grammatical structure. For Barr, gender ‘cannot be taken to reflect a thought pattern’ because gender determination ‘is not … made by distinctions in thought or by distinctions in the actual objects named but by matters of linguistic form and type’.260 Lakoff, conversely, emphasises that such classifiers do create cognitive categories, and thus require consideration in any model of thought. Moreover, such categories exhibit expected
257 Gibbs, Poetics, 15. 258 Barr, Semantics, 40. 259 Lakoff, Women, 104-109. 260 Barr, Semantics, 40.

Chapter 2: Culture, Language and Thought

54

properties for thought categories: central and peripheral members; basic-level prioritisation; conventional mental images; metonymy applied to these images; and metaphor.261

Polysemy further exemplifies this conflict. Barr seeks the earliest stage where Hebrew senses established by metaphorical transference have a non-concrete sense, allowing an individual semantic history separate from the physical sense.262 His concern is when a physical sense ‘ceased to be active and productive’,263 no longer being relevant for speakers’ cognitive processes. For Cognitive Linguistics, conversely, using a word in an ‘abstract’ target domain, even if no longer commonly used in the source domain, is insufficient evidence to preclude reasoning from the physical domain. The domains may still be conceptually integrated, especially if structural patterns in conventional language (generalisations over polysemy, generalisations over inference patterns, and novel extensions) support this. Thus, evidence for whether a polysemous word may still activate a physical domain comes more from comparison with other words suggesting the same link than from detailed analysis of that word’s semantic development.

Finally, although Cognitive Linguists do assume language reflects thought, the thought structures reflected are more carefully articulated and restricted than by Barr’s contemporaries, only allowing relationships consistent with research in cognitive science on thought processes.264 Perceptual abilities to recognise similarities (and thus create categories) and identify certain entities as salient, are fundamental to human thought. Thus, mental categories are organised around prototypes and have varying salience, with the basic-level being prioritised. Language categories share these properties, with grammatical and lexical structure reflecting these same psychological phenomena. In this sense, language and thought are similarly structured.

Second, Barr argued one cannot use presuppositions about a cultural mind to interpret linguistic evidence. Cognitive Linguistics assumes no peculiarity for the Hebrew, or any other, mind. Universal psychological phenomena are emphasised, though producing differing linguistic phenomena in different contexts. However, Cognitive Linguistics does
261 Lakoff, Women, 109-110. 262 See discussion of ‘faith’ and ‘truth’ in Barr, Semantics, 161-205. 263 Barr, Semantics, 186. 264 Lakoff, ‘Contemporary’, 234.

55

sometimes privilege an Anglo-American ethnopsychology, using English terms (such as ANGER) to state universal conceptual phenomena, although several scholars try to minimise this.

Using image schemas and primary metaphors reflecting near universal experience provides a relatively neutral basis for analysing any given language. Common cultural experiences and linguistic conventions do produce typical and salient mental categories that may be widespread within a speech community. Only in this sense does a ‘cultural mind’ have any meaning.

Third, Barr contended that etymology is insufficient evidence for current cognitive associations in speakers’ minds. Cognitive Linguists do sometimes carelessly use historical metaphorical transference to prove current conceptual metaphors.265 A proposed conceptual metaphor argued only from etymological evidence, even if across several words, is less likely to influence on-line processing of language than when words continue to be used in both domains (as Fauconnier argues). Kövecses therefore no longer uses linguistic examples to assert how a domain is ‘understood’, but to make hypotheses that could be tested by cognitive psychologists.266 However, Gibbs’ work on idiom comprehension does show that coherent mental images may still be evoked by ‘dead’ figurative language, particularly for a well-elaborated conceptual metaphor, and as Deignan discovered, this mental image may still be accessible even if a word is not used in its non-figurative sense in contemporary culture.

Fourth, Barr argued against root meanings, claiming the same root form for two words is insufficient evidence of cognitive associations between them. Here the schematic networks of Langacker, Lakoff and Taylor provide a potential descriptive framework. A common morpheme like a Hebrew root creates a category, providing a point of access to a network of domains linked by a degree of shared symbolisation. Graded salience of the different links in the network enables description of the relationship between different forms. The transparency of a root in different forms (as noted by Sawyer, section 2.3.2) increases the

Chapter 2: Culture, Language and Thought

56

salience of the link between such senses, as does the salience of a schematic, generalising, link between the set of senses for two forms. Thus the dispute over the schematic link

between

and

suggests a low salience for this link. However, more generally,

the links between forms of a root in the qal and hiphil conjugations would be much more salient, and the most salient links would join forms within the same paradigm.

Psycholinguistic studies also support the distinct mental representation of the consonantal root of Hebrew words, separate from the template in which it is found.267 Berman affirms that ‘the consonantal root has definite psychological reality as both the structural and the semantic basis for new-word formation’, even for pre-literate children who have not yet been taught orthography or grammar.268 Other studies found Hebrew speakers sensitive to the consonantal root in word recognition, with priming effects discovered for words after seeing one based morphologically on the same root.269 Although biblical and modern Hebrew differ, the mental representation of words is potentially very similar, especially for children who have not yet been formally educated in grammar, suggesting the root has more cognitive significance than Barr recognised.

Fifth, Barr argued that the same form in different contexts is insufficient evidence for an
overlap in meaning. Here Cognitive Linguistics potentially has much to contribute, through
its treatment of polysemy. The flexibility of concepts in different contexts fundamentally
agrees with Barr, but the modelling of structural links between senses, and the existence of image schemas and conceptual metaphors, provides a way of describing ‘nodules’270 of
meaning that are more stable across contexts. A schematic network accessed by the use of a
lexical form, incorporating extensions from prototypes and schematic generalisations,
provides a good descriptive framework. Different nodes and related domains are accessed in
different contexts, with links to other domains differing in salience, and thus accessibility.

57

Within this framework, ‘illegitimate totality transfer’ is not the problem of suggesting a word always contains the same bundle of semantic features, but the recognition that different contexts provide different points of access to the network, so that different aspects of knowledge are accessible. Adopting encyclopaedic rather than logical semantic structures makes concepts even more flexible than for Barr, but emphasising schematic generalisations and prioritising perceptual experience in cognitive development, makes cognitive links to physical and prototypical senses much more salient than Barr suggested.

In summary, although Cognitive Linguistics follows the relativist tradition Barr so strongly criticised, especially with its mentalist assumptions about the reflection of psychology in language, it has descriptive frameworks and systematic approaches to face most of Barr’s criticisms. In particular, the psychological reality of prototypes, categories and conceptual metaphor provides a justified framework for arguing the priority of ‘concrete’ senses over ‘abstract’ ones, and the schematic network model provides a systematic method for describing the relationship between language and thought.
2.6. Linguistics and Biblical Studies II: Applications of Cognitive Semantics to Hebrew
2.6.1. Overview
Scholars have begun applying Cognitive Linguistics to biblical texts. Many are unaware of Barr’s concerns. Others mention him, but there has been little dialogue regarding the fundamental differences in linguistic approach, necessitating the preceding discussion.

Some Cognitive Linguists use biblical texts to test hypotheses in a non-Indo-European language. Thus, Sweetser cites the Hebrew metaphorical transfer from ‘hear’ to ‘obey’ as showing common semantic development of perceptual verbs,271 and Gibbs uses biblical evidence to show the prevalence of the ‘journey’ metaphor.272 Jäkel’s investigation of the biblical metaphor LIFE IS A JOURNEY is more thorough,273 investigating the conceptual metaphor LEADING A MORAL LIFE IS MAKING A JOURNEY ON GOD’S WAY. Comparing with English, he notes similarities (such as difficulties in life being impediments to travel) and

Chapter 2: Culture, Language and Thought

58

differences (such as whether the path itself is crooked or straight). Most significant is the lack of elaboration of the ‘path’. In English, journey stages correspond to life stages, but this is absent in the Bible. Jäkel’s work considers seriously the way a biblical conceptual metaphor is instantiated, but suffers from using an English translation rather than Hebrew original, and from imposing his own interpretative logic on the text, as when he claims the ‘path to life’ in Proverbs 10.17 must refer to eternal life in God, since the earthly lifespan is already conceptualised as the journey, not the goal,274 This logic is at odds with the focus in wisdom instruction on maintaining a wise life in this world, not some after death experience.

More sensitive applications of Cognitive Linguistics to the Hebrew text come from biblical scholars. Three significant groups can be identified.
2.6.2. The South African School
Several scholars associated with the University of Stellenbosch have applied Cognitive Linguistics to the Hebrew Bible. First, within lexicography, Reinier de Blois has started creating a ‘Semantic Dictionary of Biblical Hebrew’ (SDBH)275 to remedy the failure of previous lexicons to show semantic structure, the relations between word meanings prioritised in Cognitive Linguistics. It aims to represent ‘as much as possible the ways of thinking of the speaker of the language, and do justice to his / her organisation of experience’.276 Specifically, it shows prototypical meanings, represents encyclopaedic knowledge in different domains and highlights metaphorical transfer.

Elsewhere, Rechenmacher investigates prototypes and basic-level categorisation for Hebrew

lion terminology277 whilst Foster cognitively analyses

(‘covenant’), arguing biblical

cognitive categories,279 setting it above Clines’ Dictionary of Classical Hebrew, which only lists syntactic frames.280 His own lexicographic application of Cognitive Linguistics281 investigates the meaning potential of Hebrew words related to strength. Meaning potential is ‘all the information that a word has been used to convey either by a single individual or, on the social level, by the language community’,282 a potential partially activated in any given context. Elsewhere, van der Merwe investigates Hebrew conceptual metaphors, and explores the translation implications.283

Second, several works utilise Kövecses’ emotion research, with the conventional language approach fitting contemporary psychological studies of emotion better than approaches focused on theological implications or Hebrew anthropology.284 Kruger seeks Hebrew evidence for Kövecses’ conceptual metaphors for anger285 and fear,286 though restricting himself to evidence of the English metaphors, rather than investigating specific Hebrew conceptual metaphors. He has also investigated depression287 and the face and emotions,288 and summarised Hebrew emotion research.289 Kotzé’s approach is more sensitive, utilising Kövecses’ ‘scope of metaphor’ by first finding the source domains for a given target, then investigating the scope of these source domains within the Hebrew corpus in an attempt to

deduce their main meaning foci.290 For example, the main meaning focus for ‘fire’ in Hebrew is ‘destruction’, compared with ‘intensity’ in English. Kotzé then studies target domains of sex, lust and rape, showing fire in lust metaphors evokes resulting destruction more than the intensity of passion.291 However, Kotzé’s main focus is the conceptualisation of anger,292 enumerating the source domains conceptualising anger in Hebrew, showing particularly the significance of breathing through the nose.

Elsewhere, Basson analyses metaphors in lament psalms, noting the significance of the updown schema,293 and the conceptual metaphor PEOPLE ARE PLANTS, demonstrate structural mappings, such as blossoming corresponding to a person’s prosperity.294 Pohlig also uses conceptual metaphor theory and surveys the methodological difficulties in applying Cognitive Linguistics to the Bible: the tendency to treat biblical culture as monolithic; the reliance on texts rather than native speaker intuition; and the theoretical difficulties at the heart of conceptual metaphor theory that this chapter has sought to partly address.295

The European Association of Biblical Studies’ research programme on ‘Metaphor in the Hebrew Bible’ uses the Cognitive Linguistic approach as one strand in a multifaceted approach intending ‘to fully grasp the phenomenon of religious metaphor’.296 Encyclopaedic knowledge and conceptual metaphor has been explored in relation to images of enemy and self,297 animals,298 fire,299 walls,300 restricted space301 and bitterness302 in lament Psalms and Lamentations. These studies are referred to as necessary within the thesis.

2.6.4. SIL
SIL is also producing a Cognitive Linguistic lexicon, called ‘Key Terms in Biblical Hebrew’ (KTBH). This assumes ‘our experience, knowledge and beliefs are structured in cognitive or conceptual networks which may be activated by language’.303 The documentation is based on Langacker and Taylor, using Fillmorean ‘frames’ for networks that interrelate all information that a speech community typically associate with a given term, and Langacker’s ‘domains’ for a coherent body of background information. Thus, frames link domains together, and words provide points of access to the domains. Further, the SIL approach distinguishes core domains that are accessed in nearly every use of a word from non-core domains that are more peripheral, accessed only in certain contexts.

Ken McElhanon uses conceptual metaphor theory to investigate ‘truth’ in the New Testament, finding the ancient conceptual metaphor TRUTH IS A ROAD.304 Elsewhere, he applies image schemas and human physiological universals to Old Testament metaphors.305 He considers VERTICALITY, CONTAINMENT and NEAR-FAR schemas, concluding that heaven, holy, strength, honour, security, prosperity, pride, arrogance and intelligence are all UP, and their opposites DOWN. Whilst the entailments McElhanon deduces are helpful (‘being accepted is being allowed to approach’, ‘being uninvolved is being distant’, ‘rejecting is being absent’), his attempt to apply logic to conceptualisations found in poetic works written

by different authors at different times often ignores the possibility of people holding alternate, potentially conflicting conceptual metaphors for the same target. Conceptual metaphor theory relies on the existence of structural and systematic conventional links between domains. However, since metaphors highlight different aspects of experiences, they typically cohere, but only rarely will they be consistent.306

All these approaches help to shape the current thesis through their methodologies and the pitfalls they highlight, as well as through their specific results.
2.7. Position of this Thesis
In conclusion, the following claims of cognitive semantics are assumed in this thesis. 1. Language and thought: The cognitive processes governing language use are in principle the same as other cognitive abilities. Thus, language structure does provide access to thought structure. 2. Encyclopaedic knowledge: Understanding language requires networks that link many different domains of knowledge. There is no arbitrary cut-off point between linguistic and encyclopaedic knowledge. 3. Prototype categories: Categories in the mind are structured around prototypical examples, so that particular experiences may be better or worse examples of a category depending on their proximity to prototypical examples. 4. Basic-level categories: Some categories in the mind are more salient than others. The most salient are basic level categories. 5. Language Universals: There is a strong universal component in the relation between human thought and language. These universals are rooted in embodiment. Cognitive, and thus linguistic, universals arise from common experiences of life within a human body, particularly through image schemas such as CONTAINMENT, SOURCE-PATH-GOAL, or UP-DOWN. 6. Linguistic Relativity: Linguistic relativity is significant, as recognised by Humboldt, Sapir and Whorf. The schemas chosen and elaborated within cultures, and the way

Chapter 2: Culture, Language and Thought

63

different geographical locations and cultural milieus shape the experience of embodiment, give rise to a real form of linguistic relativity.
7. Thought mappings: Conceptual structures are characterised by mappings, whether metaphorical mappings between domains or metonymic mappings within domains.
8. Priority of the concrete: In contrast to Barr, abstract domains are normally understood through more concrete ones, which as more experientially basic are taken to be more prototypical.
9. Polysemy: Senses are not isolated meanings. Rather sense networks are accessed by a given word, with certain clusters of meaning being more stable than others. Polysemy reflects links between domains, particularly from prototypical instances to other domains, which are entrenched to varying degree and are reflected in overarching schemas of varying salience. Thus, whilst heeding Barr’s salutary warnings that polysemy does not necessarily show any current relation in the mind of readers or hearers, nevertheless, polysemy is a significant potential source for investigating what domains a culture may see as corresponding with each other.
This chapter has introduced this theoretical framework and refuted the claim that such an approach is ‘outmoded’. Naturally, several difficulties remain when applying this approach to the restricted corpus of an ancient language, without access to native intuition. However, the growing literature relating cognitive semantics to Hebrew texts shows some potential options.

The body of this thesis investigates Hebrew conceptual metaphors for distress in a specific corpus. Following the methodology of Kövecses and Kotzé, the source domains for ‘distress’ (image schemas of VERTICALITY, CONSTRAINT and FORCE, and primary metaphors from vision and taste) will be examined to find how they constrain inferences about distress.

However, first, the corpus needs clarification. If encyclopaedic knowledge is crucial to semantics, it is important to investigate the geographical, cultural and social milieu of the texts, including ascertaining whether it is that of post-exilic Judea or the early Israelite monarchy. Defining a coherent target domain also requires a systematic methodology: how can one argue that a particular metaphor relates to the target domain of ‘distress’ in a way that is intersubjectively testable, and does not import Anglo-centric categories? The next chapter considers these two issues, firstly identifying a coherent general corpus of Classical

Hebrew and clarifying the cultures that gave rise to it, and then arguing for a specific corpus of personal distress discourse for detailed study, with the target domain justified on extralinguistic form critical grounds in order to reduce the subjective element.

3.1. Introduction
This chapter clarifies the texts to be investigated and the situations that produced them. Cognitive Linguistics assumes conceptual metaphors depend on embodied experiences within culture, so it is necessary to know which cultures they arise from, a controversial issue for Hebrew texts. First, Classical Hebrew is identified, a period of Hebrew language development (incorporating biblical and Qumranic material) sufficiently homogeneous in language and cultural background for a cognitive investigation. Second, a specific subcorpus of texts referring to first person situations of distress is identified, forming the basis for the subsequent research.
3.2. The General Corpus
Hebrew has over 3,000 years of literary history,308 exhibiting a surprising ‘fundamental unity’ of language.309 For some, this unity dates everything to Persian times or later, reflecting no earlier culture or language.310 However, it is more likely that authors accessed ‘quite substantial Judaean oral and written sources that had originated between the eighth and sixth centuries BCE’, even if they tuned it to Persian contexts.311 Substantial archaeological evidence from the Iron Age (and only then) also converges with biblical texts.

These cannot have been invented by writers in Persian times, so they must have had access to very substantial early and authentic witness to this period.312

If the biblical text reflects sources from at least the Iron Age, what other sources are relevant for a linguistic study of comparable texts? Pragmatically, texts considered must be limited to some general corpus. This general corpus excludes Ugaritic texts and the Mishnah, but includes all significant Hebrew texts from the intervening era, whether biblical or Qumranic. The justification for this general corpus is given below.
3.2.1. Development of the Hebrew Language
Hebrew is a North-West Semitic language and by the earliest biblical texts was sufficiently distinct from Ugaritic, Aramaic and other Canaanite dialects to qualify as a separate language.313 Even so, Ugaritic texts might have significant relevance to this thesis, revealing the ‘source of Hebrew mythopoeic thought and expression’.314 However, the gulf in theological worldview diminishes the relevance of these texts, as does the ongoing debate over the relationship between the two languages. Alongside the pragmatic inability to do justice to the literature in Ugaritic Studies, there are sufficient reasons to exclude Ugaritic texts from the general corpus.

The first distinctively Hebrew texts to which we have access315 are biblical poetry such as Judges 5 or Exodus 15, possibly dating to the twelfth century B.C.E.316 The Hebrew of these texts has been termed Archaic Hebrew,317 and may exemplify a literary language, ‘clearly distinguished from the everyday spoken language’.318 Most biblical texts, however, preserve a relatively homogeneous stage of Hebrew language development, mostly deriving from pre-

However, epigraphic parallels show that biblical Hebrew is more similar to pre-exilic inscriptions than later external sources.

exilic times, termed Classical or Standard Biblical Hebrew. This was perhaps ‘an “official” language … used at court and in educated circles in Jerusalem’.319

The social impact of exile undoubtedly affected language, especially through contact with Aramaic. Late Biblical Hebrew is used for a third distinctive stage, preserved in uncontroversially post-exilic texts such as Chronicles, Ezra-Nehemiah and Esther.320 SáenzBadillos claims this is now an artificial language, venerating and imitating traditional formula and vocabulary, but thoroughly divorced from the spoken language of the Judean community.321

This is significant since separation between written text and everyday language suggests it less straightforwardly reflects mental categorisations. Sáenz-Badillos uses Kutscher’s study of 1QIsaa to argue that during the last centuries B.C.E. ordinary people ‘could barely understand [Biblical Hebrew (BH)] or even read it correctly’.322 Such claims exaggerate Kutscher’s work, which argued ‘Hebrew was still more or less generally understood’,323 stressing that though Hebrew was declining in its domains of use, it was precisely amongst the ‘ordinary’ semi–literate people that Hebrew was spoken longest.324

Archaic, Standard and Late Biblical Hebrew traditionally comprised ‘Classical Hebrew’, seen as distinct from Mishnaic Hebrew.325 Qumran texts, however, incorporate features of both Late Biblical Hebrew and Mishnaic Hebrew, blurring the boundaries between these two previously distinct domains.

The Qumran scrolls date from the final two centuries B.C.E. and the first century C.E., and exhibit such a variety of idiolects, dialects, styles and registers that the term ‘Qumran

Hebrew’ suggests a false unity.326 It is unclear whether the texts demonstrate a substandard language to make Biblical Hebrew easier to understand by the semi-illiterate masses,327 or a struggle between living Aramaic, spoken Late Biblical Hebrew and a liturgical classical Hebrew, or whether they reflect a stable language between biblical and Mishnaic Hebrew.328 It is agreed, though, that the Hebrew represents ‘a fundamentally biblical form of language’,329 and second, that the differences from Late Biblical Hebrew reflect a spoken, rather than solely literary, language.330 These make Qumran Hebrew appropriate for the general corpus.

The social upheaval of 70 C.E., and even more following the Bar Kokhba revolt (132-135 C.E.), finally ended Hebrew’s use as a living dialect.331 Thus, texts from this era (the Tannaitic phase of the Mishnah) are the last texts to consider including in the general corpus, if it is to reflect a period when at least some form of Hebrew was still spoken. When the Mishnah was first written (around 200 C.E.) the language it was written in was already ‘dead’.

Although initial analysis of the Mishnah’s language concluded it was an artificial literary creation, since Segal332 most scholars agree that Mishnaic Hebrew was actually a living language (albeit possibly a syntactically limited version of the spoken language333),
particularly following discovery of the Bar Kochba letters at Qumran, non-religious material written in essentially Mishnaic Hebrew.334 Now, many see ‘vital links between Biblical Hebrew and Mishnaic Hebrew’,335 so semantic study of Classical Hebrew should include the
Mishnah. However, as the Mishnah lacks poetic depictions of distress, it would not
contribute greatly to this thesis, and so can be reasonably excluded from the general corpus.

3.2.2. A Recognised Corpus
This definition of Classical Hebrew concurs with several recent semantic projects. The Dictionary of Classical Hebrew considers ‘all kinds of Hebrew from the period prior to about 200 C.E., that is, earlier than the Hebrew of the Mishnah’,336 as does the Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament. ‘Classical Hebrew’ was also used for this selected corpus by the Oxford Hebrew Lexicon project.337 Elsewhere, the European Science Foundation database project chose ‘the language of the Hebrew Bible, … ancient Hebrew epigraphical material, Ben Sira and the Hebrew Qumran texts’.338 This convergence validates the general corpus of Classical Hebrew outlined above.

3.3. The Specific Corpus
3.3.1. Definition of the Specific Corpus Within this general corpus, a specific corpus will be exhaustively analysed to show how significant each metaphor for distress is.339 This corpus is defined as comprising all first person singular texts that refer to a situation of distress. The three elements here are elucidated below.

First, first person singular texts provide best access to individual emotional and psychological perceptions, potentially differing from third person perspectives,340 and echoing an anthropological trend towards personal subjective experience.341

Second, choosing texts referring to a situation of distress means it may be portrayed as present, as in Job, or past as in the Hodayot. This also avoids the difficulties of time reference for Hebrew verbs in poetry.

The final aspect, a situation of distress, is most controversial. What classifies something as a

distress situation? This thesis claims there is a gestalt concept of ‘distress’ structured by

various metaphorical and metonymical mappings that surface in the linguistic expressions used in distress situations.342 To investigate these expressions, a way of identifying pertinent

texts is needed, even when lexical items for ‘distress’ (such as

) are absent.343 This

difficulty is common to any metaphorical research investigating the vehicles for a given conceptual topic (which may well be implicit), versus investigating the scope of an image, which must be explicitly present. Subjectivity is thus unavoidable, but can be minimised by identifying tokens using formal and structural elements common to ‘distress’ discourse (as identified by form criticism) alongside characteristic contents. More detail is provided in section 3.3.2.b.

Language expressing distress is, broadly speaking, emotional language, even if ‘distress’ is
not considered a basic universal emotion, so this study fits alongside recent cognitive studies of emotion language.344 Defining emotion has become controversial, especially as linguists have become involved in the debate.345 One definition is a ‘spontaneous human reaction to reality’,346 making the Hebrew descriptions of distress ‘emotional’ to the extent they
verbalise spontaneous reactions to negative situations. Psychologists and philosophers have
traditionally studied universal physiological aspects, including quickened pulses or widened
eyes, defining a few universal emotions, such as sadness, happiness, anger, fear, disgust and
shame. However, humans can express emotions verbally, and linguists have discovered

substantial variation in how different cultures conceptualise emotions, consolidating different physiological and social aspects within linguistic convention.347 Thus, ‘whereas feelings may be universal, humankind’s conceptualisation of segments of the emotional continuum may strongly depend on cultural norms and beliefs’,348 with languages offering several conventionalised ways of expressing emotion, both in poetic and ‘normal’ discourse. Athanasiadou claims further that correspondences or universals ‘are to be found on the level of image schemas rather than on the level of translation equivalents’.349

Thus, this thesis cannot single out one particular emotion of, say, ‘fear’, against ‘sadness’ or even ‘anger’. The metaphorical language of ‘distress’ overlaps with each of these specific emotions expressed in English, and yet has a conceptual unity seen in the conventional forms of literature in which it is expressed and the conventional metaphors themselves used to articulate these experiences. This broad target domain, avoiding the terms of Anglo350 ethnopsychology, distinguishes this thesis from Kruger’s and Kotzé’s previous cognitive treatments of Hebrew emotion.351

Explicitly then, the specific corpus contains Job’s laments, individual laments and thanksgivings of the Psalter, Lamentations 3, Isaiah 38.2-10, Jonah 2.2-9[3-10], the ‘confessions’ of Jeremiah and the Hodayot from Qumran. All contain either Standard Biblical Hebrew or the variety of Qumran Hebrew most closely resembling it.

The ‘distress’ target domain can be somewhat clarified by investigating the cultures and situations these texts reflect, although mostly preserved for their broad applicability.352

347 Wierzbicka claims even the concept of ‘emotion’ is culture specific. ‘Feelings’ are universal, but the particular interaction of ‘thinking’ and ‘feeling’ implied by emotion is particular to Anglo culture, Wierzbicka, Emotions, 1-7.

3.3.2. Context of the Specific Corpus
a) Job
Job is difficult to situate, as its language is difficult and historical details did not serve the author’s purpose.353 Unusual names for God suggest the speeches are early, whereas Aramaisms354 or the possibility that Job represents a post-exilic crisis in Jewish thinking suggest a late date.355 The second century B.C.E. Targum at Qumran dates Job earlier than this, probably between the seventh and third centuries B.C.E.356 Similarities to Isaiah and Jeremiah suggest an early post-exilic date, but absence of clear reference to exile or Jerusalem’s destruction suggests a pre-exilic composition.357 Wolfers explicitly dates Job between Sennacherib’s siege of Jerusalem in 701 and the destruction of 586, since, although Job suffers, like Jerusalem, his life is spared.358 Certainly a pre-exilic date cannot be dismissed.

Regarding the situation occasioning the conventional metaphors of distress, the narrative context is one of great loss (of wealth and family) and illness. Even if they should be ‘metaphorically processed’359 as representing the Fall of Jerusalem or the siege of Sennacherib,360 the narrative context has priority for this thesis.
b) Psalms
Psalms referring to a ‘situation of distress’ provide the broadest set of metaphors for this thesis. This section provides the form critical argument, then surveys potential historical and social backgrounds.

Gunkel identified three major Psalm types including first person reference to a distressing experience: individual lament; individual thanksgiving psalm; and communal lament.361 His categories derived from form and content: common literary form; a common life-setting within a specific occasion of worship; and a common treasury of thoughts and moods.362 He saw these all originating as early liturgical poetry composed by priests363 to be used in the sanctuary at times of illness,364 although the extant psalms have become spiritual poems365 with only the figurative presupposition of sickness remaining.366 Most scholars accept Gunkel’s typology,367 but see a cultic setting for many more Psalms (in contrast to the more pietistic Hodayot), whether in the temple368 or in post-exilic local community worship.369 Most likely, then, the biblical texts contain ‘a large number of both pre- and post-exilic psalms’.370

Kraus371 and Brueggemann372 challenged Gunkel’s typology. First, Kraus criticised Gunkel

for mixing form and content in classification, and for naming genres with words external to

the texts. Kraus himself used headings from the Psalms to distinguish songs of praise

(

), songs of prayer (

), royal psalms (.

+ ) and songs of Zion ( +

, ). ‘Songs of prayer’ embrace Gunkel’s Communal Laments, Individual Laments and

Individual Thanksgivings, emphasising the strong content similarities between Gunkel’s ‘Thanksgivings’ and ‘Laments’, with the only objective difference sometimes being the order of elements. Thus, Williamson argues both types were intended for use after a period of distress.373 Second, Brueggemann distinguishes three functional groups, classified via

orientation, disorientation and re-orientation. Psalms of disorientation and re-orientation refer to distress, with those of disorientation arising from periods of psychological imbalance and those of re-orientation from a time of return to equilibrium, but referring to the previous experiences.374

These approaches show a coherent group of psalms referring to a situation of distress, whether through Gunkel’s form criticism, through thematic links native to the text (Kraus’ ‘songs of prayer’) or through psychological conditions suggested by their content (Brueggemann’s disorientation and re-orientation). The convergence of all these interpretative strands gives credibility to this research. Given this coherent category of psalms, it is legitimate to hypothesise correlated mental categories for life experiences that might ‘fit’ their use.

What experiences occasioned these Psalms? Three settings are typically suggested: illness, battle and accusation.375 Illness is suggested for various psalms referring to body parts in abnormal states. Seybold’s thorough treatment (especially of vocabulary) argues that Psalms 38 and 88 certainly reflect illness, probably also 6, 13 and 51, and possibly 31, 35 and 71.

The language of armed conflict is also frequent, and sometimes the ‘enemies’ are foreigners, suggesting the king offered these psalms, representing the people.376 However, sometimes the enemies are explicitly within the psalmist’s community. These texts exemplify the final suggested setting, that of trial. 1 Kings 8.30-31 provides a possible background, with an accused man appealing to God as judge in the temple. Although Schmidt assigned most lament psalms to this life setting,377 there is really insufficient evidence to substantiate any kind of cultic trial.378

Thus, there is no consensus on the precise situations, the psalms being ‘couched in such vague and general terms they were probably capable of being employed in a wide range of

75

types of distress’.379 For this thesis, the significant result is that the language of illness, armed conflict and trial provide salient examples, functioning as prototypes to metonymically structure the experience of a much wider range of distressing situations.
c) Lamentations
Lamentations’ five poems date from after Jerusalem’s destruction in 586 B.C.E., and probably before 538 B.C.E. Most likely they come from lay people speaking ‘the language of ordinary discourse, not that of a specialised group, school or profession’, shown by the analogies used,380 and the faith they reflect.381 The acrostic form may be a later overlay,382 or come from the temple-singers finding a new form of prayer.383 Several scholars stress the essential unity throughout the book,384 with Shea arguing the poems have been together since their composition based on the macrostructure of three long and two short poems, as in qinah meter.385

Chapter 3 is in the specific corpus, and differs from other chapters. References to Jerusalem’s destruction are much less obvious here.386 Correspondingly, this chapter draws most on the conventional language of distress (as in Job and Psalms), perhaps being a later attempt to typify the historical situation for use in liturgy,387 or reflecting an exilic perspective to correct the other poems’ theology.388 Further, only chapter 3 uses the first
person singular, recounting the voice of the $ $ , a typical figure ‘who represents what any man may feel when it seems that God is against him’.389

Lamentations 3 is significant in the corpus because we have a fixed date and context. The degree of unity ties all the poems inescapably to the experiences of 587-586 B.C.E. in Jerusalem. Further, the authors were undoubtedly aware of earlier lament psalms, so the conventional language may draw deliberately on their phrases and motifs. A direct intertextual relationship with Job is harder to substantiate, despite the linguistic affinities. Rather, this chapter suggests the existence of ‘a common fund of … lament vocabulary which was used in the laments of the Psalter, the book of Job and Lamentations’.390
d) Confessions of Jeremiah
Several of Jeremiah’s ‘confessions’ were form-critically identified by Gunkel as individual laments.391 The texts include 8.18-23, 10.19-25, 11.18-23, 12.1-6, 14.2-15.21, 17.9-18, 18.18-23 and 20.7-18,392 which Baumgartner claimed couched Jeremiah’s inner struggles in the conventional language of lament Psalms.393 Such material is unparalleled in the prophets, perhaps being transmitted orally by Jeremiah to his friends (rather than publicly proclaimed) and eventually becoming part of the present text.394 Although they give access to Jeremiah’s personal anguish, this anguish is all the more real as ‘it did not arise from his personal suffering alone, but was a reflection of the suffering of his people and the suffering of God’.395
e) Distress Language in Narrative Contexts
There are two lament-type psalms in narrative contexts referring to a distress situation, specifically Jonah’s (Jonah 2) and Hezekiah’s prayers (Isaiah 38).

The book of Jonah has been variously dated linguistically from the eighth to third centuries B.C.E. Further, the psalm itself could faithfully reflect Jonah’s words,396 or be a later scribal addition.397 Whichever holds, it is a good, structured example of a thanksgiving psalm by all
the form-critical criteria, containing conventional psalm imagery, albeit particularly apposite

imagery for Jonah’s narrative situation. Stuart describes it as ‘the closest one can get to a psalm composed specifically for the events Jonah experienced while still remaining a true psalm, i.e. general and pan-temporal’,398 whereas Sawyer more sceptically ‘wonders whether the situation, of Jonah inside a big fish, was not invented just to provide points of reference for details in the psalm’.399 Usefully for this thesis, it shows conventional imagery and forms being applied to a specific narrative situation of distress, that of drowning in the sea.

Second, Hezekiah’s prayer in Isaiah 38.10-20 uses conventional imagery in the context of Hezekiah’s illness, placed after Hezekiah had recovered, despite appearing formally closer to a lament than a thanksgiving. Thus, Hezekiah’s ‘lament’ is located after recovery and Jonah’s ‘thanksgiving’ from the midst of distress, further demonstrating the similarity of individual thanksgivings and laments, and cautioning against jumping too quickly from form to life-setting.
f) Hodayot
The limited redactional activity for the Hodayot simplifies identification of authorship, date and provenance. However, fragmented manuscripts make it harder to ascertain the original text.400

The first scroll found, 1QHa, has been dated palaeographically after 50 B.C.E. However, the handwriting of 1QHb suggests it is a copy from between 100 and 50 B.C.E.401 Thus, they may come from the early years of the Qumran community (second century B.C.E.), with at least some possibly penned by the Teacher of Righteousness himself.

Holm-Nielsen first suggested the Hodayot were a collection (rather than a literary unity), originating ‘possibly from different authors and from different times’.402 He divided them
into Thanksgiving Psalms and Hymns. The former centre on first person reference to distress situations and correspond to the following columns and verses of 1QHa: 10.1-19; 10.20-30;

10.31-11.4; 11.5-18; 11.19-36; 11.37-12.4; 12.5-13.4; 13.5-19; 13.20-end; 14.1-15.5; 15.625; 16.4-end and 17.1-36.403

Several scholars divided this collection further into those from the Teacher of Righteousness versus other anonymous members of the community.404 However, most recently, Michael

Douglas argues linguistically (using a signature phrase) that ‘1QH cols 10-17 are substantially the work of a single author’,405 probably the ‘Teacher of Righteousness’

describing his experience of conflict in Jerusalem and culminating in his exile from the land

(

* , 1QHa 12.8).

The relation to the biblical psalms is also debated, given many similar images and metaphors. Licht claimed the Hodayot made ‘rather awkward use of a great many biblical phrases’ and were ‘on the whole rather humdrum … [and] repetitive, to the point of monotony’.406 Conversely, Kittel argued they stand alongside other great poems of the ancient world.407 Newsom also speaks positively, seeing a ‘first-class piece of rhetoric’, partly resulting from the traditional quality of the imagery.408 Further, the unanticipated ways Cave 4 copies fill lacunae in Cave 1 manuscripts shows that ‘the vocabulary of these hymns seems to have been less stereotypical and standardised than has sometimes been assumed’,409 where ‘biblical words and phrases are reworked and reconfigured in a style that is quite different from earlier biblical poetry’.410 Such activity, bringing in extra aspects of the source domain, is evidence that the source domain continues to be active in the minds of the authors,411 rather than being just a humdrum repetition of tradition.

these hymns for more than a hundred years must have also consolidated these ways of viewing distress, becoming ‘an important factor in shaping the self-identity and worldview of the community members’.412 Indeed, while one cannot be sure of the original Sitz im Leben, one can be sure that ‘the repetition of the various forms and images, and even the emotional patterns of the Hodayot, served to shape the beliefs and religious emotions of those who read them’.413

Chapter 4: Methodology
‘Any research project needs to include overt discussion of the extent to which the reader can be confident about the nature of the data which has been selected or omitted from the study, about the techniques of analysis and categorisation used, and about the extent to which the data support the conclusions.’ Graham Low414
4.1. Introduction
Having introduced Cognitive Linguistics and identified a corpus of texts to investigate, the next step is to outline the methodology for investigating the conceptualisations within this corpus.

First, to operationalise this research, two areas need clarification: the terminology for describing metaphors; and a method to identify and categorise them. Taking metaphors as fundamentally conceptual, the focus is on investigating conceptual entities (cognitive models, image schemas, prototypes, metaphoric and metonymic mappings) structuring distress experiences. However, since these are only accessible through linguistic expressions, a framework is necessary for analysing linguistic metaphors. Unfortunately, this receives little consideration in standard works on conceptual metaphor theory,415 so other works are used.416

4.2. Metaphor Terminology
Following cognitive semantics, prototypes can be used to describe metaphorical language. First, topic and vehicle are easily seen in an ‘ideal’ linguistic metaphor: ‘A is B’, where A and B are both nouns. The topic, A, is ideally a literal referent in the world of the text. B is the vehicle. Consider Psalm 84.11[12]:

/0

, - $$

For the LORD God (is) a sun and shield.

416 Principally, L. Cameron and G. Low, Researching and Applying Metaphor (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999).

Chapter 4: Methodology

81

Here, ‘the LORD God’ is the topic and ‘a sun and a shield’ are vehicles. The topic is explicit and the vehicle predicates something of it that creates tension. It is literally inapplicable: God is not a shield in the most experientially basic way.

Such ideal prototypes are rare in the specific ‘distress’ corpus, although Lamentations 3.10 gives one example.
- " 1" He (is) a bear lying in wait for me.

Much more commonly within linguistic corpora,417 the linguistic vehicle is a verb, as in Lamentations 3.9.
2 ( 1 *3 He has blocked my way with hewn stones.

Here, the verb phrase is the vehicle. Identifying the topic is problematic, however, because of terminological confusion between using topic in surface language description and description of conceptual phenomenon.418 In 3.10 (‘he is a bear…’), ‘he’ (God) was both the pragmatic topic of the sentence and the metaphorical topic, the entity conceptualised in terms of the vehicle. In Lamentations 3.9, ‘he’ (God) is still the pragmatic topic, but the vehicle conceptualises some unexpressed activity, the metaphorical topic. This conceptual topic could be paraphrased as ‘the distress he caused me’, suggesting the implicit metaphor ‘(the distress he caused me is) he has blocked my way with hewn stones’.

This terminological conflict is avoided by distinguishing surface topic from conceptual topic.419 Whereas the surface topic is usually easily discernible, the conceptual topic is often

only inferable through knowledge of the discourse situation,420 with the metaphor being implicit. These include co-textual implicit metaphors (where the conceptual topic is explicitly present elsewhere in the discourse) and contextual implicit metaphors (where the conceptual topic is not mentioned anywhere in the cotext).421

Thus, the request to be saved from ‘dogs’ in Psalm 22.20[21] is a co-textual implicit metaphor, since dogs and evildoers are equated in 22.16[17]. Conversely, the waves and breakers in Psalm 42.7[8] create a contextual implicit metaphor. The genre implies the conceptual topic is the psalmist’s distressing experience, but the co-text gives few clues to any more precise identification.
Finally a conceptual vehicle can be identified,422 clarifying which conceptual source domain(s) the surface vehicle provides access to and what prototypical knowledge about this domain is being mapped. Consider, for example, Lamentations 3.5a:

He builds against me.
Here the surface topic is God (anaphorically), and the surface vehicle is ‘building against’ someone. The conceptual topic is being in distress, identifiable from the discourse context. Establishing the conceptual vehicle is harder, especially at such a distance in time and culture, requiring knowledge of prototypical ‘builders’, what they would be building, and why. Here, the consensus view is that ‘siege’ is the conceptual vehicle, so that the NRSV translates ‘he has besieged (me)’. Elsewhere the conceptual vehicle is more debatable.
4.3. Metaphor Identification
With this terminology, what linguistic expressions should be used to investigate conceptual topics and vehicles? Linguistic cues might include a literal inapplicability of the vehicle423
Metaphor Analysis’ in L. Cameron and G. Low (eds.), Researching and Applying Metaphor (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999), 81-104. 420 Steen, ‘Discourse’. 421 Steen, ‘Discourse’, 82-91. 422 Extra steps are given in G. J. Steen, ‘From Linguistic to Conceptual Metaphor in Five Steps’ in R. W. Gibbs, Jr. and G. J. Steen (eds.), Metaphor in Cognitive Linguistics (Amsterdam: John Benjamins, 1999), 57-77.

83

(as when discussing God’s ‘arrows’ in Job 6.4) or a lack of congruence of the vehicle with the non-verbal setting424 (as when attack with bow and arrow is used in Psalm 11.2[3], but for a context of non-physical attack). However, again, a prototypical approach is more helpful than necessary and sufficient criteria,425 since ‘every criterion for a metaphor’s presence, however plausible, is defeasible in certain circumstances’.426 With a prototype approach to the category of metaphors, linguistic examples match the prototype to greater or lesser degree.427

The most stereotypical linguistic metaphors resemble Lamentations 3.15:

&

4

He has filled me with bitterness; he has sated me with wormwood.

Here, the author describes his distress with vehicles that are unlikely to be physically applicable, referring to bitterness and wormwood to access the quite different domain of consuming something poisonous. Thus, in this prototype, the conceptual topic is clear (‘distress’) and there is a linguistic vehicle accessing a distinct domain, incongruous both to the rest of the co-text and the non-verbal setting. Other linguistic expressions may be better or worse examples by comparison to this prototype.

In less ideal cases, the only point of access to an incongruent source domain may be the etymology of the linguistic vehicle. For example, in Psalm 4.1[2], it is the etymological relationship between and situations of physical constraint that reveals a conceptual
metaphor, although made more prominent by the following word. Elsewhere, the etymology of one word alone may be a potential vehicle.

Chapter 4: Methodology

84

Psalm 4.1[2]: You gave me room when I was in distress.

Such examples, where the incongruity is just at the etymological level, are included in the list of potential data, although their relevance for conceptualisation must be substantiated by other evidence, rather than presuming that such incongruity would be noticed by a hearer, 428 as outlined in chapter two.429 Etymological incongruity generates a broad base of metaphors to include in the database; the existence of systematic generalisations over different examples can then provide the evidence whether such incongruity is indeed significant.
4.4. Collection of Data
With this broad prototypical definition of relevant data, the following method was used to collect data. First, the specific corpus was read, noting descriptions of the subject’s distressing circumstances (where ‘distress’ was the conceptual topic) and comparing them to the metaphor prototype. Where these could potentially be viewed as vehicles describing the conceptual topic in terms of a more basic experiential domain, they were included as tokens in a database. Tokens included vehicles consisting of a single lexical item (like % ) through to images sustained in a whole verse (or even collection of verses), as in the metaphor of being trapped in the cords of death that runs through Psalm 18.4-5[5-6].

The word ‘potentially’ provides a broad data set, but also an unavoidable subjective element:
who decides whether a particular phrase is potentially related to a more basic domain? The
main curb came from established lexicons. For example, when deciding if particular lexical
items should be considered as potentially relating to a more basic experiential domain, several standard lexicons were consulted (including BDB,430 TWOT,431 TDOT,432 and NIDOTTE433) to see if a meaning was given in a more basic domain. If the standard lexicons
did not refer to any more basic experiential domain, or only did so in discussion of possible
