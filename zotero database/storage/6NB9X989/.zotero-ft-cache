Part I
INTRODUCTION

Metaphor and Thought
The State of the Art
Raymond W. Gibbs, Jr.

Metaphor and Thought: The State of the Art
The publications of the ﬁrst and second editions of Metaphor and Thought (Cambridge University Press) in 1979 and 1993 , respectively, under the editorship of Andrew Ortony, were monumental events in the world of metaphor research. The 1979 edition was the ﬁrst interdisciplinary volume devoted to metaphor that included contributions from notable scholars in philosophy, linguistics, psychology, and political science. Many of the articles in that volume are now classics and continue to be frequently cited among active metaphor researchers. Several other articles from scholars in linguistics and psychology were added to the 1993 edition, which too has been widely read and discussed.
But much has changed in the world of metaphor since 1993 . There is now a huge body of empirical work from many academic disciplines that clearly demonstrates the ubiquity in metaphor in both everyday and specialized language. Most importantly, there is also signiﬁcant research indicating

the prominence of metaphor in many areas of abstract thought and in people’s emotional and aesthetic experiences. Metaphor is not simply an ornamental aspect of language, but a fundamental scheme by which people conceptualize the world and their own activities. The primary purpose of the Cambridge Handbook of Metaphor and Thought is to describe some of the key developments in contemporary metaphor research that detail the contribution of metaphor to human cognition, communication, and culture.
There are several distinguishing features of this handbook. First, metaphor scholarship has signiﬁcantly advanced from purely speculative accounts of how metaphor works and is understood, primarily based on the analysis of a few, isolated linguistic examples. There is now much greater attention to the ways that context shapes metaphor use and understanding. Much of this work comes from experimental studies, but an increasing number of corpus studies, both small and large scaled, demonstrate some of the complexities associated with making general claims about the structure and

function of metaphors in language and thought. Indeed, many of the chapters in this volume address the beneﬁts and limitations of different methods for doing metaphor analysis, both at a local level for identifying individual instances of metaphor in language and nonverbal expression and at a global level for reliably inferring larger-scale patterns of metaphorical thought from public manifestations of metaphor. More generally, the vast literature on metaphor has used a variety of analytic techniques to investigate empirically the broad extent of metaphor in human life.
Second, there is now a greater emphasis on situating metaphor studies within broad, comprehensive models of human cognition, communication, and culture. Although metaphor is clearly an important topic in its own right, the empirical study of metaphor has broader implications for theories of mind and meaning, especially in showing the prominence of metaphorical thought in everyday life. But theories of metaphor are now, more than ever, linked to detailed theoretical frameworks that aim to describe the underlying nature of language, thought, and communication. Many of the authors in this volume view metaphor as part of a larger system of human cognition and communicative practices and consequently do not believe that verbal and nonverbal metaphor requires extraordinary human effort to be produced and understood. Moreover, seeing metaphor as a natural outcome of human minds also points to new ways in which metaphor is related to a variety of other linguistic forms and cognitive activities.
Third, and related to the previous point, metaphor scholarship now focuses greater attention to how metaphor comes into being in both thought and communication. The traditional interest in metaphor centered on the question of how people understand novel metaphorical language, with the implicit assumption that the creation of these poetic ﬁgures was attributed to special individuals with signiﬁcant artistic talents. But the articles in this collection place greater emphasis on where metaphors come from (e.g., brains, bodies, and culture), why

metaphor is so prominent in language and thought, and how public manifestations of metaphor (e.g., language, art, music) are speciﬁcally constrained by different communicative and emotional forces. In this way, the scope of metaphor studies has expanded enormously in recent years to cover the spectrums from brains to culture and from language and gesture to art and music.
Fourth, the incredible rise in the sheer number of scholarly works on metaphor in different academic ﬁelds illustrates a heightened sensitivity to metaphor. This increased attention demonstrates how scholars in virtually every discipline (e.g., mathematics, law, music, art) can contribute to understanding the functions and meanings of metaphor. Thus, research on metaphor is now as multidisciplinary, and interdisciplinary, as perhaps any topic being studied in contemporary academia. One result of this explosion of research on metaphor is a marvelous interaction between basic and applied scholarship, such that ﬁndings on the ways that metaphors are employed in realworld contexts offer important constraints on general theories of metaphor. Metaphor does not always appear in nice, neat packages that can be easily plucked out from some context for analysis. Speakers use metaphorical language, and engage in metaphorical thought, in complex, often contradictory patterns that make simple conclusions about both the ubiquity and structure of metaphor difﬁcult to make. Rather than retreat back to made-up, isolated examples, many contemporary scholars exhibit great enthusiasm for uncovering the messy reality of metaphor use and the implications of such ﬁndings for comprehensive theories of metaphor.
Fifth, the interdisciplinary nature of metaphor studies now allows for greater recognition of the complex ways that metaphor arises from the interaction of brains, bodies, languages, and culture. Most earlier work conducted within traditional disciplinary frameworks aims to singularly locate metaphor as part of, for example, language (linguistics), mind (psychology), or culture (anthropology), with few scholars ever acknowledging the ubiquity

of metaphor in other domains of experience such as gesture, art, and music. This often created unproductive tension between metaphor scholars as individuals defended their own “turf ” and methods as being the best way to understand the essence of metaphor and its interpretation. Contemporary metaphor scholarship, as seen in many of the present chapters, has properly shown how the analysis of speciﬁc metaphoric language in context, for instance, reveals the simultaneous presence of neural, linguistic, psychological, and cultural forces. This complexity, again, makes it difﬁcult to offer sweeping, simplistic conclusions about metaphor, where it comes from and how it is used by real human beings in naturalistic contexts. But this trend to seek out language–mind–culture interactions in metaphor studies offers the best hope for understanding the prominence of metaphor in human understanding, yet one that appreciates the subtleties of human meaningmaking practices shaped by a variety of linguistic and nonlinguistic sources.
Finally, several chapters in this volume give witness to the struggle that I refer to as the “paradox of metaphor,” in which metaphor is creative, novel, culturally sensitive, and allows us to transcend the mundane while also being rooted in pervasive patterns of bodily experience common to all people. Traditional metaphor scholars, and metaphor enthusiasts, typically resist arguments, and empirical ﬁndings, either suggesting the conceptual roots or embodied foundation for metaphorical thought and language. These critics see metaphor as a special rhetorical device that enables us to transcend momentarily above the ordinary literal world. Linking metaphor to the body, or entrenched conceptual thought, as in the idea of “conceptual metaphor,” seems to some as far too reductive and dismissive of the power of metaphoric language to reshape our imagination.
Yet advocates of entrenched patterns of metaphorical thought readily acknowledge metaphor’s ability in both verbal and nonverbal forms to create new modes of understanding often accompanied by special aes-

thetic pleasures. In many instances, however, creative, poetic metaphors are extensions of enduring schemes of metaphorical thought and not necessarily created de novo. Understanding how metaphor is both fundamental to many aspects of thought and yet special for creative language and artworks is a challenge taken up by several authors in this volume. My hope is that readers interested in the aesthetic qualities of metaphor will take the time to explore some of the proposals on the conceptual and embodied grounding for metaphorical thought and will see how this research draws connections between what is simultaneously ordinary and spectacular about metaphor.
All of the authors contributing to this volume are distinguished scholars from different academic ﬁelds who have done important work on metaphor and related poetic ﬁgures. The interdisciplinary world of metaphor scholarship is so large, with literally hundreds of excellent researchers making new discoveries all the time. A handbook like this one can only provide a forum for a small subset of this outstanding group of researchers, but I am pleased to present the new thoughts of the present contributors because their work is among the most widely recognized and discussed within the ﬁeld. Not surprisingly, there are many areas of disagreement among the present contributors both in terms of the methods employed to do metaphor analysis and the resulting theories proposed to account for different aspects of metaphor in language, thought, and culture. Yet I am happy with this diversity of methods and theories because the topic of metaphor and thought is not one that is likely to be comprehensively characterized by any one perspective.
Contributors to this handbook were encouraged to write about their latest ideas but to do so in a way that readers new to the topic, or less familiar with the research on some facet of metaphor, will be readily able to recognize the signiﬁcance of these ideas and proposals for ongoing thinking and research on metaphor. The handbook is divided into ﬁve general sections: (1) the roots of metaphor, (2) metaphor

understanding, (3 ) metaphor in language and culture, (4) metaphor in reasoning and understanding, and (5 ) metaphor in nonverbal expression. I hasten to note, however, that each chapter in the volume addresses major foundational themes on the relations between metaphor, thought, and understanding. A brief overview of each contribution is presented.
The Roots of Metaphor
The ﬁrst section offers several contrasting visions on where metaphor comes from and how metaphor serves as the often unknowing foundation for human thought.
George Lakoff ’s chapter describes new advances in the brain sciences and neural computation relevant to metaphor (“The Neural Theory of Metaphor”). Links between brain and body are central to understanding the nature of thought, and metaphor is no exception. The neural theory follows developments in simulation semantics in which the neural circuitry characterizing the meanings of words, like “grasp,” is also activated when one imagines or perceives grasping. This sense of meaning as mental stimulation is applied to the creation and use of metaphorical patterns such as those associated with “grasping concepts.” The neural theory therefore offers a coherent set of explanations for why there should be conceptual metaphors in the ﬁrst place, how metaphorical inferences work, how metaphors differ from blends, and how primary and complex metaphors contribute to our understanding of abstract concepts and the meanings of words, complex expressions, and grammatical constructions. Metaphor scholars need not conduct neural computational work themselves, and Lakoff offers insights on how to apply the broad scope of the neural theory to address fundamental issues on metaphorical thought and language.
Mark Johnson’s chapter describes the importance of metaphor for the study of philosophy (“Philosophy’s Debt to Metaphor”). Not only is metaphor a topic that has

long interested philosophers, but philosophers use the same conceptual resources of metaphor as do any human being, often without any awareness, and indeed outright rejection, of the fact that they are doing so. Johnson shows how perennial questions in philosophy – What is mind and how does it work? What does it mean to be a person? What is the nature of reality? Is there such a thing as free will? What things or actions are morally good? – are all dependent on metaphor for their answers. Philosophical reasoning and theories often rest on a foundation of simple and complex metaphors. Johnson concludes that giving proper acknowledgment to metaphor, and metaphoric thinking, is essential to future progress in philosophy.
Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner’s chapter outlines recent theoretical advances on metaphor within conceptual blending theory (“Rethinking Metaphor”). Through a detailed analysis of the T I M E I S S P A C E metaphor, they demonstrate how metaphor interpretation requires elaborate integration networks and various techniques for building particular networks such as cobbling and sampling, compression, emergent structure, and overarching goals. These permanent features of cognition are not special to metaphor but can give rise to counterfactuals, analogies, categorizations, and metonymies. Nonetheless, the general framework of conceptual blending theory is capable of explicating various complexities of metaphorical thought and meaning that are difﬁcult to describe within more traditional theories.
Sam Glucksberg’s chapter describes empirical research in favor of the idea that metaphors are comprehended through both categorization and comparison processes (“How Metaphors Create Categories – Quickly”). He ﬁrst rejects the traditional assumptions that literal meanings are necessarily processed either before or in parallel to nonliteral meanings given experimental ﬁndings that when available, metaphorical meanings are automatically determined. Glucksberg then considers the idea that metaphors are understood entirely by

comparison processes but claims instead that both literal and ﬁgurative comparison statements, including some similes, can be understood as implicit categorizations. Metaphors and similes are not identical because these two forms often communicate very different meanings for the same topic and vehicle terms. From this evidence, Glucksberg concludes that both categorization and comparison processes are used in metaphor and simile understanding, with apt metaphors working best as categorizations because the vehicle concept is an ideal example of the category it represents.
Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson outline their “relevance theory” perspective on metaphor in their chapter (“A Deﬂationary Account of Metaphors”). Under this view, speaking metaphorically is an example of “loose talk” that often is the best way to achieve optimal relevance. Even though verbal metaphors do not represent a completely accurate state of affairs, listeners are able to infer efﬁciently the appropriate contextual meanings of metaphors by creating ad hoc concepts following the principle of optimal relevance. Ad hoc concept construction is a process that is typical of metaphorical interpretations, but it is not exclusive to metaphors. In general, relevance theory maintains that metaphors are nothing special in terms of their processing, even if metaphors often convey special cognitive effects or meanings not easily communicated by more direct speech.
Metaphor Understanding
The second group of chapters presents various theories of how metaphors are understood based on different computational, behavioral, and neuroscience research.
Dedre Gentner and Brian Bowdle argue in their chapter that metaphors and similes are understood with processes of similarity and analogy (“Metaphor as Structure-Mapping”). They describe how processes of structural alignment, inference projection, progressive abstraction, and re-representation of different domains

are critical to immediate processing of both metaphors and similes. Moreover, widespread conceptual metaphors may be best characterized as extended structuremappings between domains. Gentner and Bowdle then present their “career of metaphor” theory which claims that metaphors and similes typically evolve from being understood as novel comparison statements to being interpreted as category-inclusion statements in which the vehicle terms serve as the best instances of ad hoc categories. The “career of metaphor” hypothesis aims to offer a uniﬁed framework for understanding metaphor, analogy, and similarity.
Walter Kintsch’s chapter offers a computational theory of metaphor understanding based on the technique of “latent semantic analysis,” or LSA (“How the Mind Computes the Meaning of Metaphor: A Simulation Based on Latent Semantic Analysis”). LSA operationalizes meaning in terms of high-dimensional semantic space, measured in terms of word co-occurrence, irrespective of their symbolic relationships, and is based on a corpus of 11 million words. Word senses within LSA are not ﬁxed but emergent from both the context-free vector that represents a word in LSA space and the context in which a word is used. This model allows Kintsch to predict the metaphorical or literal meanings of various noun-is-a-noun phrases that accord with human participants’ interpretations and aptness judgments. Simple metaphorical and literal language is therefore not understood by different processes as both can be comprehended by a model of human knowledge based on how word meanings are represented that is objective and comprehensive.
Rachel Giora’s chapter explores psycholinguistic studies on whether people engage in different psychological processes understanding literal and nonliteral language use (“Is Metaphor Unique?”). Her discussion analyzes various theoretical models of ﬁgurative language interpretation, with special attention to metaphor, which make different predictions on both the early processes and late products of understanding.

RAYMOND W. GIBBS, JR.

Giora forcefully argues that metaphor does not require distinct psychological processes to understand but that the salience of an utterance’s meaning primarily determines the speed with which it is understood, not whether it is literal or ﬁgurative. She goes on to suggest how the salient–nonsalient continuum accounts for many empirical ﬁndings in the experimental literature not explainable by alternative theories and provides insights into the aesthetic appreciation of poetic metaphor.
Raymond W. Gibbs, Jr., and Teenie Matlock’s chapter argues that part of our ability to make sense of metaphorical language, both individual utterances and extended narratives, resides in the automatic construction of a simulation, whereby we imagine performing the bodily actions referred to in the language (“Metaphor, Imagination, and Simulation: Psycholinguistic Evidence”). They describe empirical evidence from cognitive science showing the importance of embodied simulations in different cognitive activities and discuss very recent ﬁndings from psycholinguistics on metaphoric language interpretation that is consistent with the idea that our bodily imaginations are actively recruited in metaphor use. This process of building a simulation, one that is fundamentally embodied in being constrained by past and present bodily experiences, has speciﬁc consequences for how verbal metaphors are understood and how cognitive scientists, more generally, characterize the nature of metaphorical language and thought.
Seana Coulson reviews the major empirical ﬁndings on the neurological substrate of metaphor comprehension (“Metaphor Comprehension and the Brain”). Her discussion suggests that too much of this research assumes metaphor to be a homogenous category (e.g., metaphor and idioms are often grouped together), and that, somewhat surprisingly, there has been no empirical study of the effect of conceptual metaphors on the neurological processes involved in metaphoric language understanding. Coulson urges scientists to not simply seek the neural substrates of metaphor in tra-

ditional language areas of the brain. Much recent research and theory points to how metaphor relies on interactions between auditory, visual, kinesthetic areas of the brain, and the entire human body in the physical–cultural world more generally.
Metaphor in Language and Culture
The third group of chapters examines the prominence and functions of metaphor in different contexts, including different languages and cultures.
Lynne Cameron explores the ways that metaphor shapes, and is shaped by, ongoing talk (“Metaphor and Talk”). Her analysis reveals that metaphors are sporadic in discourse, sometimes appearing in thick clusters and sometimes absent altogether. Cameron discusses some of the ways that metaphor is signaled in talk and allows conversational participants to manage their interactions and come to joint understandings of various ideas, while in other instances, people’s talk suggests their entirely different metaphoric understandings of ideas and events. She also strongly argues that claims about conceptual metaphor are too often divorced from real language use, and that each individual may have different versions of conceptual metaphors given their respective culturally contextualized experiences and interactions.
Graham Low’s chapter considers the impact of metaphor on teaching and learning, as well as on concepts of educational change (“Metaphor and Education”). He criticizes some notable past theories of educational concepts and processes, such as the idea of “generative metaphor,” for failing to empirically demonstrate that people actually conceptualize situations in metaphoric, as opposed to metonymic, terms. Theoretical proposals about metaphor in education must not, therefore, be made apart from rigorous empirical analyses that are sensitive to context-sensitive differences between metaphor and metonymy. Low then examines the role of metaphor in foreign-language teaching and raises some

METAPHOR AND THOUGHT

critical questions about the indiscriminate application of cognitive theories of metaphor to classroom situations. He urges that educators pay greater attention to how metaphor is used at a discourse, and not just vocabulary, level, and that more discussion should be given to exactly what teachers want students to learn through their exposure to metaphor.
Elena Semino and Gerard Steen consider in their chapter the ubiquity and functions of metaphor in literature (“Metaphor in Literature”). They note the paradox of metaphor in literature being both continuous and discontinuous with metaphorical language use in non-literary contexts. On the one hand, many literary metaphors are based in common metaphorical schemes of thought seen in non-literary discourse (e.g., political speeches and scientiﬁc writings), while, on the other hand, some literary metaphors are unique to their speciﬁc contexts in both form and functions. Semino and Steen explain how both points of view have validity and that understanding the distribution, function, and effects of metaphor in literature will require supplementary information from both corpus-linguistic and psycholinguistic studies.
Ning Yu describes how metaphor emerges from the interaction between body and culture in his chapter (“Metaphor from Body and Culture”). He provides a detailed analysis of body-part terms for “face” in Chinese and English to show how metaphors are typically grounded in bodily experiences that are shaped by cultural understandings. Yu also shows how a decompositional analysis based on the distinction between primary and complex metaphors allows us to determine which aspects of metaphor are bodily or culturally based. Primary metaphors, derived from bodily experience, are likely to be widespread and universal, while complex metaphors, based on basic metaphoric and metonymic mappings and cultural beliefs, are likely to be more culturally speciﬁc.
Josef Stern’s chapter considers whether and how a semantic theory can account for the meanings of metaphors (“Metaphor,

Semantics, and Context”). Stern responds to two skeptical challenges to a semantic theory of metaphor regarding the difference between what words literally mean and can be used to say and the contextdependence of metaphorical meaning. He advances a semantic theory that elaborates how metaphor depends on the literal and how context has different roles in the communication of metaphorical meaning. More generally, Stern offers a philosophical account of how the semantic structures of metaphor help us understand its cognitive signiﬁcance beyond its propositional content in context.
Alice Deignan introduces the important advances on metaphor in corpus research (“Corpus Linguistics and Metaphor”). She presents detailed analyses showing how many classic cases of both linguistic and conceptual metaphor, often arising from consideration of single texts or analysts’ own intuitions, are not exhibited in the same patterns when viewed from the perspective of large corpora studies. In some instances, data from experimental psycholinguistics on metaphor understanding may not accurately reﬂect what people ordinarily do because the metaphors studied do not follow typical collocational and syntactic patterns. Deignan argues that metaphor scholars must therefore be more sensitive to naturalistic language patterns in constructing experimental tests and broader theories of metaphor and suggests ways that corpora linguistics can aid researchers in achieving this goal.
Yeshayahu Shen describes the relation of metaphor to several other poetic ﬁgures, notably, simile, zeugma, and synaesthetic metaphors, in his chapter (“Metaphor and Poetic Figures”). He aims to answer the difﬁcult question – how can many novel ﬁgurative expressions whose meanings are difﬁcult to describe often be so easy to understand? Shen argues that the cognitive “directionality” principle (i.e., metaphorical source domains tend to represent conceptually more accessible, concrete, and salient concepts than do target domains) accounts for various empirical ﬁndings on the distribution and comprehension of poetic ﬁgures.

RAYMOND W. GIBBS, JR.

This work complements research on conceptual metaphor theory and experimental psycholinguistic studies of ﬁgurative language by demonstrating how the meanings and systematicity of many novel, poetic ﬁgures arise from the interaction of different linguistic conventions and fundamental cognitive principles.
Metaphor in Reasoning and Feeling
The fourth section of chapters highlights the role of metaphor in different forms of reasoning and in human feeling and expression.
John A. Barnden’s chapter offers an overview of why metaphor is central to many applications of work in artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) (“Metaphor and Artiﬁcial Intelligence: Why They Matter to Each Other”). He argues that metaphorical mappings can best be described in computational terms that concretely outline what gets mapped, the effects these mappings achieve, and how to avoid unwanted side effects of these mappings. Moreover, AI work shows the importance of reasoning about beliefs and uncertainty in metaphorical thinking and verbal metaphor interpretation, and how metaphor is integrated with metonymy in much inferential understanding. AI provides an excellent set of tools for doing metaphor research that requires scholars to be explicit about underlying mechanisms of thought and language central to metaphor theory.
Rafael Nu´ n˜ ez’s chapter presents the case for an embodied, metaphorical understanding of many mathematical concepts (“Conceptual Metaphor, Human Cognition, and the Nature of Mathematics”). He offers an analysis of how various mathematical ideas are described in terms of metaphorical language and argues that such talks reﬂect metaphorically alive structuring of abstract concepts and thus are not dead metaphors. Nu´ n˜ ez goes on to show how metaphoric gestures employed when people talk about mathematics provides important evidence on the psychological reality of metaphorical mathematics. Overall, mathematics arises

naturally from the interactions of our brains, bodies, and experiences with the world, and conceptual metaphor has a big part in the creation and maintaining of abstract mathematical ideas.
Steven L. Winter’s chapter (“What Is the ‘Color’ of Law?”) presents an in-depth analysis of the metaphor “color of law” (i.e., referring to ofﬁcial misconduct or the way the trappings of ofﬁce provide individuals with the power and prestige of the state) to show how both historical and contemporary legal theory is guided by metaphoric conceptualizations. Contrary to the widely held belief in legal circles that metaphors are to be avoided, with legal reasoning being best served by ideas that are propositional and deﬁned by necessary and sufﬁcient criteria, Winter argues that the cognitive theory of metaphor challenges the beliefs that linguistic meaning is arbitrary and a matter of speakers’ self-consciously held intentions. Meaning is conﬁgured by embodied and social experiences that are framed and constrained by metaphoric processes. Recognition of metaphorical thought, and the methods of conceptual metaphor analysis, demonstrates how legislative statutes express signiﬁcant aspects of our social reality that cannot be devalued by reductive approaches to legal reasoning.
Zolta´n Ko¨ vecses’s chapter examines the questions of whether emotion metaphors are unique to emotions and whether emotion metaphors are universal (“Metaphor and Emotion”). Based on detailed, crosslinguistic analyses, he claims that emotion metaphors primarily arise from the genericlevel metaphor C A U S E S A R E F O R C E S , and that certain speciﬁc source domains (e.g., O P P O N E N T , N A T U R A L F O R C E , H E A T ), apply to a wide range of target concepts other than emotion. Furthermore, even though many emotion metaphors are grounded in universal bodily experiences, there is signiﬁcant cultural framing of these experiences that lead to variation in the kinds of source domains in emotion metaphors across different cultures.
Linda M. McMullen writes on the role that metaphor plays in psychotherapy

METAPHOR AND THOUGHT

11

(“Putting It in Context: Metaphor and Psychotherapy”). She argues that most claims about the effect of metaphorical language in psychotherapeutic outcomes ignore the contextualized nature of metaphor in client and therapist talk. Isolating speciﬁc metaphors for analysis has made metaphor seem too powerful in some cases and benign in other situations. McMullen calls for empirical investigations of metaphor that properly acknowledge the conversational exchanges and cultural contexts in which they are part. Only by putting metaphor in context can we fully understand what metaphors do for us in psychotherapy and other situations.
Antal F. Borbely’s chapter describes the importance of metaphor in the concepts and practice of psychoanalysis (“Metaphor and Psychoanalysis”). Although psychoanalysts have long debated the role of metaphor in psychoanalysis, Borbely offers a new understanding of metaphor and its interaction with metonymy within psychoanalysis by situating his overview in terms of contemporary advances in metaphor research over the past two decades. By demonstrating how key psychodynamic concepts such as trauma, defense, transference, and interpretation are grounded in fundamental metaphoric and metonymic principles, this chapter provides for new links between psychoanalysis and research from cognitive science.
Cristina Cacciari’s chapter addresses the topic of synaesthetic metaphor, where it comes from, and how it is understood (“Crossing the Senses in Metaphorical Language”). She argues that perceptually based metaphorical expressions (e.g., “cold silence”) are grounded in the structure of perceptual experiences and the human sensory system. Contemporary research in cognitive and neuropsychology lends support to this idea, with most people being able to use synaesthetic metaphors quite easily. However, some individuals have special abilities to create and exploit cross-sensory mappings (i.e., blending sounds with colors), which also provide extraordinary evidence for how sensory experiences, supported by neural mechanisms, are fundamental to metaphorical mappings in thought and language.

Metaphor in Nonverbal Expression
The ﬁnal section describes several important research trends on metaphor in different forms of nonverbal expression.
John M. Kennedy’s chapter discusses how metaphor, and other related tropes, can be realized in art objects, such as paintings (“Metaphor and Art”). He ﬁrst notes that metaphors are abundant in art with metaphoric pictures often playing on the activity of picturing as a way of using a pictorial device to make a point about the topic. Metaphoric pictures are especially notable because, as Kennedy claims, the mind does not use images that most directly illustrate the thought. Kennedy introduces some contrasts between verbal and pictorial metaphors, describing, for example, how some successful verbal metaphors can make poor pictorial ones and vice versa. This chapter generally celebrates the perceptual nature of metaphoric thought and the ways that art allows people to play with metaphoric possibilities.
Charles Forceville’s chapter discusses the meanings and functions of metaphor in pictures and other multimodal forums (“Metaphor in Pictures and Multimodal Representations”). He describes how metaphors in pictures, advertisements, and ﬁlms share many of the same qualities observed in linguistic metaphor, including how conceptual metaphors appear to motivate many aspects of nonlinguistic metaphor. However, the study of pictorial and multimodal metaphor also raises important questions about the identiﬁcation of source and target domains in all metaphorical mappings. Forceville aptly considers some of the communicative purposes of multimodal metaphors and suggests they may have more emotional impact than linguistic metaphors, and aid both local and global narrative coherence, even in cases where the creator of a picture or ﬁlm, for instance, did not consciously intend these metaphors to be understood as such.
Alan Cienki and Cornelia Mu¨ ller argue in their chapter that gestures offer important insights into the metaphorical nature

12

RAYMOND W. GIBBS, JR.

of language, thought, and cultural ideas (“Metaphor, Gesture, and Thought”). They describe a variety of linguistic, psychological, and anthropological evidence showing how detailed analyses of gesture offer support for the claim that metaphor is a general, pervasive cognitive principle, and that many metaphoric mappings, such as those evident in metaphoric gestures, are processed online during face-to-face talk. Cienki and Mu¨ ller discuss some methodological issues related to studying metaphoric gestures in naturalistic settings, including the problem of correctly identifying and labeling underlying conceptual metaphors. Their chapter emphasizes that metaphor is best conceived of as a cognitive activity that occurs online in the process of speaking and is therefore clearly an example of dynamic embodied cognition.
Lawrence M. Zbikowski’s chapter provides a historical and conceptual survey of metaphor and music (“Metaphor and Music”). He argues that music is a manifestation of human cognitive capacities and tied to other aspects of human experience, such as the expression of emotion. Through his analysis of various musical compositions, Zbikowski proposes that even if music and language have different cultural functions, they both rely on embodied imageschematic structures for the expression of meaning. Musical events correlate with bodily experiences associated with many other modalities, such as vision, taste, and proprioception. In general, this chapter illustrates how the study of music, as a distinct nonlinguistic medium, provides important insights into metaphorical thinking processes.
The Future
The state of the art in metaphor studies is a rich, colorful mosaic of ideas and research activities. Predicting the future of metaphor studies is clearly a risky business given the tremendous diversity of work now being done and as evidenced in this collection. But there are several themes that are touched on in this volume which are likely to become of

even greater interest as topics of discussion and debate in the future. Let me brieﬂy mention a few of these and their implications for metaphor research.
One issue that often arises in informal discussions of metaphor studies has to do with the reliability and generality of individual scholars’ analyses of metaphor. First, how representative are particular isolated examples of verbal metaphor, for instance, of the ways people ordinarily speak of the topic/concept? Second, how reliable are analyses of individual linguistic metaphors in terms of whether they are really metaphoric as opposed to metonymic, for instance? Third, exactly how did an analyst of metaphor draw the inference that a particular pattern of metaphorical thought exists from the examination of several or many instances of individual verbal metaphors? Scholars’ intuitions are clearly relevant for making claims about the nature of metaphor, what it means, and how they are possibly understood. But some metaphor scholars express concern about the variability of analysts’ intuitions in making judgments about linguistic and even nonlinguistic (e.g., gesture, music, art) matters. Many metaphor scholars now seek to establish more objective criteria for determining instances of metaphor and for drawing links between patterns of metaphoric language use and metaphorical thought. Establishing reliable, and replicable, criteria for identifying metaphor in behavior and for drawing links between metaphorical language/behavior and metaphorical thought is likely to be a major focus of concern in future metaphor studies.
A related emerging concern for empirical studies of metaphor focuses on the true frequency of metaphors in language and other media. Claims about the importance or ubiquity of particular metaphorical patterns, in either language or thought, are often made without adequate empirical support, such as reporting the frequencies with which different metaphors are found in particular texts, or comparing the ﬁndings from one’s own textual analysis of metaphor with those seen in large corpora.

METAPHOR AND THOUGHT

13

In general, there is likely to be a heightened interest in methodological questions for deﬁning the existence of metaphor in language and thought. My hunch is that resolutions to some of the theoretical debates about metaphor and thought will partly depend on the way scholars respond to these methodological concerns.
Finally, the chapters in this handbook speak loudly about the problems associated with making claims about the existence of metaphor in brains, minds, and culture from the analysis of metaphoric language. Does the analysis of metaphoric language, gesture, or artwork indicate that some metaphorical schemes of thought exist within idealized speaker-hearers, the conscious minds of real speakers, or the subpersonal unconscious minds, even their brains, of people as they speak, gesture, and create artworks? To what extent does the existence of a particular metaphorical way of think-

ing necessarily relate to brains, minds, and cultures? As mentioned earlier, many articles in this volume acknowledge the importance of brains, minds, language, and culture in both enduring and novel patterns of metaphorical thought. But teasing apart these various inﬂuences, and seeing more precisely how they interact, is likely to be a major theme of future metaphor research. Once more, much attention must be given to the exact methods metaphor scholars employ to analyze public manifestations of metaphor and infer patterns of metaphorical thought. We now know enough to feel conﬁdent in asserting that metaphor is a major player in human cognition, communication, and culture. But a future challenge for all metaphor scholars is to have greater clarity about what kinds of empirical evidence is needed, and how it is to be obtained and analyzed, to properly characterize the reach and limits of the metaphorical mind.

THE ROOTS OF M E TA P H O R

CHAPTER 1
The Neural Theory of Metaphor
George Lakoff

The neural revolution is changing our understanding of the brain and the mind in radical ways, and that is no less true in the theory of metaphor. It is more than 27 years since Mark Johnson and I wrote Metaphors We Live By in 1979. Though the fundamental outlines of what we discovered remain as valid today as they were then, developments in brain science and neural computation have vastly enriched our understanding of how conceptual metaphor works. This is an intermediate report, as of November 2006.
You may well ask why anyone interested in metaphor should care about the brain and neural computation. The reason is that what we have learned about the brain explains an awful lot about the properties of metaphor. For example, have you ever asked why conceptual metaphor exists at all, why we should think metaphorically, why metaphors should take the form of crossdomain mappings? Have you thought about how our metaphor system is grounded in experience or about why certain conceptual metaphors are widespread around the world or even universal? Have you wondered about

how complex poetic metaphors are built up out of simpler metaphors? Have you wondered about how whole systems of philosophical or mathematical thought can be built up out of conceptual metaphors? The neural theory explains all this.
It explains more as well: Why metaphorical language should take no longer to process than nonmetaphorical language. Why some sentences of the form X is Y, make sense as metaphors and why others fail. How conceptual metaphors can play a role in abstract concepts. These and other wondrous properties of conceptual metaphors fall out once one considers metaphor theory from the perspective of the brain.
In 1988, Jerome Feldman came to the University of California, Berkeley, as director of the International Computer Science Institute, and he and I formed the NTL (Neural Theory of Language) group. Feldman is one of the founders of the theory of neural computation, and we have been working together since then. Feldman’s landmark book From Molecules to Metaphors surveys much of the work of our group, and is a must-read for metaphor theorists. As a

17

GEORGE LAKOFF

background both to reading that book and to our discussion of metaphor, I offer a brief and overly simple introduction to NTL.
A Brief Introduction to NTL
Every action our body performs is controlled by our brains, and every input from the external world is made sense of by our brains. We think with our brains. There is no other choice. Thought is physical. Ideas and the concepts that make them up are physically “computed” by brain structures. Reasoning is the activation of certain neuronal groups in the brain given prior activation of other neuronal groups. Everything we know, we know by virtue of our brains. Our physical brains make possible our concepts and ideas; everything we can possibly think is made possible and greatly limited by the nature of our brains. There is still a great deal to be learned about how the brain computes the mind. NTL combines what is known scientiﬁcally with linking hypotheses based on neural computation.
The Shaping of the Brain
We are born with an enormously complex brain with hundreds of precisely and beautifully structured regions and highly speciﬁc connectivity from every region to many other regions.
Each neuron has connections to between 1,000 and 10,000 other neurons. Between birth and age ﬁve, roughly half of the neural connections we are born with die off. The ones that are used stay; the others die. That is how the brain is shaped, and such a shaping is necessary if the brain is to learn to do the huge number of things it does.
The ﬂow of neural activity is a ﬂow of ions that occurs across synapses – tiny gaps between neurons. Those synapses where there is a lot of activity are “strengthened” – both the transmitting and receiving side of active synapses become more efﬁcient.
Flow across the synapses is relatively slow compared to the speed of computers: about ﬁve one-thousandths of a second (5 millisec-

onds) per synapse. A word recognition task – Is the following word a word of English? – takes about half a second (5 00 milliseconds). This means that word recognition must be done in about 100 sequential steps. Since so much goes into word recognition, it is clear that much of the brain’s processing must be in parallel, not in sequence. This timing result also shows that well-learned tasks are carried out by direct connections. There is no intervening mentalese.
Neuronal Groups
Jerome Feldman and colleagues, in the 1970s, developed an account of “structured connectionism” – not PDP connectionism! In PDP connectionism, all computation is distributed over an entire network and nothing is “localized”; that is, no meaning for function can be assigned to any single neuron or any small collection of neurons in the network. Only very restricted parts of the brain work that way.
On the other hand, structured connectionism takes into account the local structure that exists in the brain. Neuronal groups (of size, say, between, 10 and 100 neurons) are modeled as “nodes” which are meaningful and which enter into neural computation. Since each neuron can have between 1,000 and 10,000 neural connections, nodes can “overlap.” That is, the same neuron can be functioning in different neuronal groups, or “nodes.” The ﬁring of that neuron contributes to the activation of each node it is functioning in. Though single neurons either ﬁre or not, neuronal groups contain neurons that ﬁre at different times, making the group active to a degree, depending on the proportion ﬁring at a given time.
The modeling of neural computation is done over networks with nodes, connections, degrees of synaptic strength, and time lapses at synapses.
Embodiment and Simulation Semantics
The link between body and brain is central to the concept of semantics-as-simulation in NTL. Suppose you imagine, remember,

THE NEURAL THEORY OF METAPHOR

19

or dream of performing certain movements. Many of the same neurons are ﬁring as when you actually perform that movement. And suppose you imagine, remember, or dream of seeing or hearing something. Many of the same neurons are ﬁring as when you actually see or hear that thing.
Mirror neurons occur in ﬁber bundles connecting premotor/SMA cortex (which choreographs actions) with the parietal cortex (which integrates perceptions). The same mirror neurons ﬁre when you perform an action or you see someone else performing that action. The mirror neurons are thus “multimodal”; that is, they are active not only when acting or perceiving the same action but also when imagining that you are perceiving or performing an action. Now a word like “grasp,” applies both to performing and perceiving grasping; that is, it is multimodal.
Simulation semantics is based on a simple observation of Feldman’s: if you cannot imagine someone picking up a glass, you can’t understand the meaning of “Someone picked up a glass.” Feldman argues that, for meanings of physical concepts, meaning is mental simulation, that is, the activation of the neurons needed to imagine perceiving or performing an action. One thing we know is that not all imagination or memory is conscious, and so not all mental simulations are. That is why we typically have no conscious awareness of most such simulations.
A meaningful node is a node that when activated results in the activation of a whole neural simulation and when inhibited inhibits that simulation. Inferences occur when the activation of one meaningful node or more results in the activation of another meaningful node.
NTL, following the theory of simulation semantics, suggests that the neural circuitry characterizing the meaning of “grasp” is the neural circuitry in the mirror neurons that are activated when imagining either performing or perceiving grasping.
The meaning of concrete concepts is directly embodied in this manner. There is now considerable evidence that perceiving language activates corresponding motor or

perceptual areas. For example, He kicked the ball activates the foot area of the primary motor cortex.
Activation and Inhibition
A ﬂow of ions across a synapse may either contribute to the ﬁring of the postsynaptic neuron or may help to inhibit such ﬁring, depending on whether the charges of the ions are positive or negative. The activation of neural simulations constitutes meaningful thought.
We obviously don’t think all possible thoughts at once. Indeed, most possible thoughts are either unactivated or positively inhibited most of the time.
Mutual Inhibition
Two neuronal groups can be connected so that each inhibits the activation of the other when there is an active ﬂow of ions of the opposite charge. This is called “mutual inhibition” This occurs, for example, when there are two inconsistent, but equally available, ways of looking at a situation.
This is common in politics, where a strict conservative worldview is typically inconsistent with a nurturant progressive worldview. That is, they are mutually inhibitory. But many people have both worldviews active in different areas of their lives and can think of a given situation ﬁrst from one worldview and then from the other. When one is activated, the other is inhibited.
Spreading Activation: Neurons That Fire Together Wire Together
Spreading activation at the behavioral level has been the mainstay of psycholinguistics for decades – NTL models link this behavior to neural structure. When two neuronal groups, A and B, ﬁre at the same time, activation spreads outward along the network links connecting them, which we experience as a chain of thought.
During learning, spreading activation strengthens synapses along the way. When the activation spreading from A meets the

20

GEORGE LAKOFF

activation spreading from B, a link is formed, and the link gets stronger the more A and B ﬁre together. This is a basic mechanism by which the brain is shaped through experience.
Neural Maps
We are born with neural circuitry that effectively activates a “map” of one part of the brain in another part of the brain. For example, the 100 million neurons coming out of the retina grow connections before birth from the retina to other areas, including the primary visual cortex at the back of the brain. These connections form a “topographic map” of the retina in V1. That is, the connections preserve topology (relative nearness), though not absolute orientation or absolute distance. When neurons next to each other coming from the retina ﬁre, the corresponding neurons ﬁre in V1 and are next to each other in V1.
Len Talmy (2000) has observed that spatial relations in human languages preserve topology as well. For example, containers remain containers no matter how their boundaries are stretched or contracted, and paths remain paths, no matter how they wind around. Terry Regier (1997) has constructed computational neural models of topographical maps of the visual ﬁeld that can compute image-schemas with topological properties and accurately learn the words for a nontrivial range of spatial relations in a variety of languages.
Neural Binding
Imagine a blue square. We know that color and shape are not computed in the same place in the brain: they are computed in quite different areas. Yet the blue square appears to us as a single whole, not as separate squareness and blueness. The name given to this phenomenon is “neural binding.” Neural binding is responsible for two or more different conceptual or perceptual entities being considered a single entity.

There are three types of neural bindings:
1. Permanent obligatory bindings, for example, in your stored mental image of a parrot, the feathers are green. There is a permanent obligatory binding in the neural representation for the parrot image, between the neuronal groups that characterize feather shapes and those, elsewhere in the brain, that characterize the green color.
2. Permanently-ready-but-conditional bindings, like the bindings in the neural structure for an election-night map on which any given state can be either red or blue depending on the outcome of the vote.
3 . Nonce bindings that occur on the ﬂy as they happen to arise in context.
It is not known just how neural binding operates in the brain. One hypothesis is that neural binding is the synchronous ﬁring of nodes. Lokendra Shastri has modeled the computational structure necessary to carry out binding in such a theory.
Neural Choreography
In general, the premotor cortex and supplementary motor area (SMA) choreograph speciﬁc actions, like grasping. Grasping has a neural structure of its own. There are, in addition, neural connections between the premotor/SMA and the primary motor cortex – M1. M1 is laid out topographically according to the neurons as they are connected to the body. For example, neurons connected to the hand are in the same region of M1, with neurons connected to the index ﬁnger next to neurons connected to the middle ﬁnger. The whole body is topographically connected to the neurons in M1.
Each M1 neuronal group can perform only a simple action, like opening the elbow or pointing the index ﬁnger. To pick up a bottle, those simple M1 actions must be sequenced and choreographed. The premotor cortex/SMA does the choreography, having learned neural circuits that ﬁre in complex sequential patterns. As each

THE NEURAL THEORY OF METAPHOR

21

premotor/SMA neuron ﬁres, a connection to M1 makes the right M1 neurons ﬁre, which in turn moves certain muscle groups in the body. Picking up a bottle is like an exquisite ballet with choreographic instructions being carried by the connections to the neurons in M1, which individually control each little movement.
When the bindings are in place, the premotor/SMA circuitry + bindings + primary motor circuitry acts seamlessly like a single simple circuit.
Circuit Types
NTL modeling assumes that, as our neural circuitry is being shaped by experience, certain relatively simple basic types of neural circuits emerge, as follows. The research includes ways in which circuits with these properties can be formed.
What is important for the study of thought is not the study of precise neural circuitry but rather the study of the kinds of computations that neural circuitry can carry out. An important topic in the neural theory of language is exactly what kinds of circuit types are necessary for human thought – for frames, image-schemas, conceptual metaphor, lexical items, grammatical constructions, and so on.
Neural bindings play a crucial role, forming complex circuits by binding nodes in one circuit type to nodes in another circuit type.
The winner-take-all circuit:
r Two or more subcircuits, say A and B, with mutually inhibiting connections between them.
r When A is ﬁring B cannot ﬁre, and conversely.
Winner take all circuits apply, for example, to high-level “worldview” circuits that make sense in a single way of a wide range of experiences – in politics, these might be conservative and progressive worldviews. You might understand a range of experiences using one worldview or the other, but not both at once.

A gestalt circuit:
r A collection of nodes, say, A, B, C, and D and a “gestalt node” G.
r When G is ﬁring, all of A, B, C, and D ﬁre.
r When a sufﬁcient set of A, B, C, or D is ﬁring, G ﬁres, which results in all other nodes ﬁring. One especially salient node can be sufﬁcient in some cases, or there can be a threshold and any total activation summed over all the nodes above the threshold results in G ﬁring.
r When G is inhibited, at least one of the other nodes is inhibited.
Gestalt circuits characterize the structure of frames, where the semantic roles and the scenarios are gestalt elements.
In a gestalt, the whole is more than just the sum of its parts. Accordingly, in a gestalt circuit, the whole – G – cannot be inhibited and all of its parts activated. The activation of even some of the salient parts activates the whole, and the activation of the whole activates all the parts.
Linking circuit:
r Two nodes, A1 and A2, a linking node L, and an activating connection C from A1 to A2.
r When A1 and L are ﬁring, A2 is ﬁring. But when A2 is ﬁring, A1 need not be ﬁring. Thus, linking is asymmetric.
r When A1 is ﬁring and L is not, the connection C is not active. (That is, L “gates” the connection C.)
r When A1 and A2 are both ﬁring, L is ﬁring and the connection C is active.
Note: A1 can ﬁre without A2 ﬁring (if L is not ﬁring), and A2 can ﬁre independently of A1.
Linking circuits are used in metonymy: within a frame F, one semantic role A may “stand for” another B. A metonymy is characterized by (1) a linking circuit, with nodes A, B, and X a connection C linking A to B asymmetrically, and a linking node L gating the connection C from A to B, and a context X gating the L and (2) a gestalt consisting of

22

GEORGE LAKOFF

gestalt node G and nodes F, A, B, X, and L. For example, in The ham sandwich wants his check, the frame F is the restaurant frame, the ham sandwich plays the role Dish, his refers to the entity that plays the role Customer, and L characterizes the metonymic link from the Dish to the Customer, and X is the condition that the waiter/waitress identiﬁes the Customer B primarily in terms of the Dish B.
Two-way linking circuits:
A two-way circuit linking nodes A1 and A2 is composed of two opposite one-way linking circuits, with a gestalt node forming a gestalt of the two linking circuits.
r Nodes A1 and A2. Connections C1 and C2. Linking nodes L1 and L2. Gestalt node G.
r First linking circuit: From A1 to A2 via connection C1, with linking node L1.
r Second linking circuit: From A2 to A1 via connection C2, with linking node L2.
r Gestalt circuit: Nodes L1 and L2 with gestalt node G.
r When G is activated, both links are activated. When G is inhibited, both links are inhibited.
Two-way linking circuits provide the kinds of connectivity used in grammatical constructions and lexical items, where there is a two-way connection between a lexical meaning and a lexical form. In a two-way linking circuit, a gestalt node plays trafﬁc cop, directing activation and inhibition.
Mapping circuit: r Two groups of nodes: A1, B1, C1, D1, E1
and A2, B2, C2, D2, E2. r Linking nodes LA, LB, LC, LD, LE in
linking circuits that, respectively, link A1 to A2, B1 to B2, and so on. r A gestalt circuit with nodes LA, LB, LC, LD, and LE with M as the gestalt node. r When M is inhibited, the linking circuits are all inhibited.

r When M is activated, all the linking circuits from A1 to A2, B1 to B2, and so on are activated.
Note: The mapping is asymmetric. Mapping circuits characterize conceptual
metaphors. Two-way mapping circuits (maps with two-way linking circuits) characterize the structure of grammatical constructions.
Mapping circuits are also used as part of the asymmetric connections across mental spaces. A mental space is a neural simulation S that can be activated by a single gestalt node G with semantic roles A, B, . . . in the simulation.
A cross-space map has two mental spaces: G1 consisting of simulation S1 with semantic roles (or referents) A1, B1, . . . , and G2 consisting of simulation S2 with semantic roles (or referents) A2, B2, . . . .
G1 and G2 are linked by a cross-space connection made up of (1) a gestalt node G, consisting of a space-builder B, (2) a linking circuit L with a connection C from G1 to G2, and (3 ) a mapping circuit M mapping semantic roles (or referents) A1, B1, . . . in simulation S1 to semantic roles (or referents) A2, B2, . . . in simulation S2.
For example, take the sentence If Clinton had been president of France, there would have been no scandal over his affair. The mental spaces are G1 = The U.S. during Clinton’s presidency with A1 = Clinton and S1 = his affair in the U.S., and G2 = France at that time, A2 = A Clinton-correlate and S2 = A2 is president of France who has an affair in France with no scandal; L1 is the circuit that links A1 (the real Clinton) with A2 (the Clinton correlate = Clinton).
Neural binding may be added to linking in such cases to provide a cross-space identity instead of merely a cross-space correlate. For example, consider If Clinton campaigns for his wife, she will win. Here Clinton in the conditional space is the same as Clinton in the reality space. There is not only a Clinton-toClinton link deﬁning a cross-space correlate, there is also a binding, making the correlate the same person.
In this description, the neural binding is “extra,” in addition to the linking. But the

THE NEURAL THEORY OF METAPHOR

23

binding actually makes the case cognitively simpler in that there are fewer distinct entities to keep track of. Complexity in the formal description of circuits can often correspond to simplicity in the way the brain works.
Extension circuit: r A group of connected nodes, A, B, C, D,
and E. r Nodes D and E , which are mutually
inhibitory with D and E, respectively. r An extension node, X. r When either D or E is ﬁring, X is not. r When X is ﬁring, both D and E are ﬁring,
and consequently D and E are not. This results in two circuit-alternatives: A, B, C, D, E, not X or A, B, C, D , E , X.
Extension circuits characterize radial categories (see Lakoff, 1993 , case study 3 ).
X-schema circuit: r A gestalt node r State nodes r Action nodes r Connections, both activating and inhibit-
ing r Timing nodes
X-schemas, or “executing schemas,” do things via bindings that activate other circuits. Every action node is preceded and followed by a state node, with activation spreading from states to actions to states. Timing nodes coordinate the lengths of states and actions (which may be instantaneous or elongated). Iterated actions are formed by loops from the state following an action to the state preceding the action. Conditional actions are formed by gatings – cases where activations from both nodes A and A are needed to activate node B.
The gestalt node activates the initial state and the ﬁnal state inhibits the gestalt node. Actions typically have initial and ﬁnal states, initiating and concluding actions, central actions, and may have purposes. A purposive action is one with a desired state. The pur-

pose is met if the desired state is active after the central action, and if so, the action is concluded. Each action can be neurally bound to the gestalt node of another complex Xschema to produce quite complex actions.
X-schemas characterize the structures of states and actions, referred to as “aspect” in linguistics. Aspects can be durative or instantaneous, stative or active, completive or open-ended, iterative or noniterative.
When connected to the body via the primary motor cortex, premotor/SMA Xschemas can carry out actions. X-schemas can also deﬁne scenarios within frames or narratives and carry out chains of reasoning, by sequentially activating mental simulations.
Conceptual Blends
Conceptual blends are neural bindings across distinct structures. We will discuss this further later.
The point of these characterizations of circuit types is that, in NTL, one has to be explicit about the computational properties of neural circuitry. Any cognitive analysis must be able to be carried out by the brain and by the relatively simple circuit types of this sort, or complex circuits formed by bindings. As we shall see, different mental operations require different types of neural circuitry that perform very speciﬁc neural computations.
Neural Systems Are Best-Fit Systems
It is a common cognitive phenomenon that a fact that ﬁts an overall conceptual organization is remembered better than a fact in isolation or one that contradicts an overall conceptual organization. Ideas make sense when they ﬁt a whole system of ideas.
Similarly, a linguistic compound makes sense when it ﬁts into a coherent context. Take the classic example of “pumpkin bus” – coined on a school outing. There were two buses and the road home passed a pumpkin patch. One of the buses was designated to stop there for students who wanted to buy a pumpkin. It was called the

24

GEORGE LAKOFF

“pumpkin bus,” and the compound was instantly understandable because it ﬁt the context.
Compare two sentences: “Bill drank a soda” and “Bill drank an elephant.” To get the meaning of the sentences, you need to do a mental simulation, in which Bill is drinking and a frame is activated in which a soda is bound to the patient role in the frame of drinking, which requires that it be a liquid and consumable, which it is. In “Bill drank an elephant,” again the drink frame requires a consumable liquid. Since an elephant is neither – binding the concept of an elephant to the patient’s role in the drink scenarios runs up against neural inhibition. However, context may change things. Elephant is a brand of Danish beer, and so the sentence may refer to Danish drinking experience. Or second, one could imagine a context in which an elephant was sacriﬁced by being cut up and put in a blender and liqueﬁed so that one could drink it.
What determines “ﬁt”? Maximizing the number of overall neural bindings, including context and overall knowledge, without contradiction, that is, without encountering any mutual inhibition.
A node A ﬁts a complex network B better than complex network B if the strength of neural bindings one can create between A and B without mutual inhibition is greater than with B .
Image-Schemas and Cogs
Terry Regier (1997) has constructed a neural computational model for how a range of spatial relations concepts could be computed by the brain. Narayanan (1997) has constructed a neural computational model of the structure of events, that is, X-schemas. Dodge and Lakoff (2006) have speculated on many of the details involved. Gallese and Lakoff (2005 ) have shown that certain action circuitry has the structure of frames. They have further speculated that the meanings of grammatical elements and constructions are characterized by “Cogs,” that is, secondary neural structures (e.g., premotor/SMA cortex) that bind to structures in primary cortex

(e.g., motor and visual). This would explain why grammatical meanings are “abstract” in the sense that they have a very general structure but lack speciﬁc details.
We are now ready to discuss how all of this changes old metaphor theory into the neural theory of metaphor: NTM.
THE OLD THEORY
Metaphors We Live By was written in 1979, before the era of brain science and neural computation (also see Lakoff, 1993 ). Nonetheless, certain results from that era have stood the test of time:
r Metaphors are conceptual mappings; they are part of the conceptual system and not mere linguistic expressions.
r There is a huge system of ﬁxed, conventional metaphorical mappings.
r The system exists physically in our brains. r Certain metaphors are grounded via cor-
relations in embodied experience (e.g., More Is Up is grounded via the correlation between quantity and verticality – you pour more water in the glass and the level goes up). r Metaphorical mappings are typically across conceptual domains (as in Affection Is Warmth). r Mappings (as in A Competition Is a Race) may also be from a speciﬁc case (a race) to a more general case (a competition). r Mappings operate on source domain frame and image-schema structure. r Via metaphorical mappings, source domain structures (image-schema and frame structures) are used for reasoning about the target domain. Indeed, much of our reasoning makes use of conceptual metaphors. r Metaphorical mappings are partial. r Metaphorical language makes use of conceptual metaphors. r Many different linguistic expressions can express some aspect of the same metaphor. r A conceptual metaphor may be used in understanding a word, even if that word is not realized in the source domain of the metaphor.

THE NEURAL THEORY OF METAPHOR

r Most conceptual metaphors are part of the cognitive unconscious, and are learned and used automatically without awareness.
r Novel metaphorical language makes use of the existing system of conventional metaphors.
r We commonly take our conceptual metaphors as deﬁning reality, and live according to them.
r Target domain entities and target domain predications can result from metaphors.
r Two of the relevant sources of data are generalizations over inference patterns (in the source and target domains) and generalizations over lexical items (that can be used of both source and target domains).
These results will be familiar to any student of conceptual metaphor.
To those who have read “The Contemporary Theory of Metaphor,” another result that has stood the test of time will be familiar:
r Complex metaphors are made up of simpler metaphors and commonplace frames.
For example, Love Is a Journey is composed of such conceptual metaphors as
Purposes are Destinations Difﬁculties are Impediments to Motion A Relationship is a Container Intimacy is Closeness
plus commonplace literal frame-based knowledge that:
A Vehicle is an Instrument for Travel, A Vehicle is a container in which the trav-
elers are close together, People are expected to have life goals, Lovers ideally have compatible life goals.
These are put together in such a way that:
The life goals are destinations; The lovers are travelers trying to reach
those destinations;

Their relationship is a vehicle such that the lovers are in the relationship
They are close; and The relationship (when working) helps
them achieve life goals; and The relationship difﬁculties are impedi-
ments to motion (e.g., a long, dusty road; being on the rocks or off the track).
Such compositional structures were noticed during the 1980s. It was also noticed that such structural composition was accomplished through “bindings” – identiﬁcations of one element with another. Thus, the life goals of the ideal lovers are “bound” to the life goals that are understood as destinations. A vehicle used for travel is typically a container, which is bound to the container in the metaphor that A Relationship is A Container.
It was also noticed that an optimization principle was at work in forming such composite metaphors:
r Maximize the overall strength of bindings.
Destinations occur in a travel frame. There are Travelers in that frame. Given that the Life Goals of the Lovers are bound to the Life Goals understood as Destinations, the optimization principle leads to the binding of the Lovers with Life Goals to the Travelers going to Destinations, to yield the metaphorical mapping that Lovers Are Travelers.
Those bindings make possible certain metaphorical inferences: source domain inferences that are mapped combine with target domain knowledge via binding to produce new inferences: If lovers are “stuck” in relationship, if the relationship isn’t “going anywhere,” then they are not making progress toward common life goals. If the lovers are “going in different directions,” then they may not be able get to the same destinations, which means metaphorically that their common life goals may be inconsistent.
The NTL perspective provides a very different way of thinking about such complex metaphors. The “maximize bindings”

26

GEORGE LAKOFF

principle is simply a consequence of the fact that the brain is a best-ﬁt system. Inferences are new activations that arise when bindings occur. We can now explain why the Love Is a Journey metaphor exists, why Lovers should be Travelers, why Relationships are Vehicles, and why the Lovers’ common life goals are Destinations.
In a system where Lovers ideally have compatible Life Goals, and Goals (that is, Purposes) are Destinations, then (binding Life Goals and Goals) Lovers ideally have compatible destinations, which induces (via best ﬁt) the metaphors that Lovers are Travelers and Lovers ideally have compatible Destinations.
Consider our existing conceptual system where A Relationship is a Container, A Vehicle is a Container in which the Travelers are close together, Intimacy is Closeness, Lovers are intimate, A Vehicle is an Instrument for Travel, and Lovers are Travelers. Binding containers to containers, vehicles to vehicles, and travelers to travelers and bringing those bindings together with the metaphorical mapping that Lovers are Travelers yields (by best ﬁt) A Relationship is a Vehicle that Lovers are in.
In short, the Love is a Journey metaphor arises naturally via best ﬁt from the rest of the system.
To see the real importance of such an observation, let us look at primary metaphors and how they are acquired.
Primary Metaphors
The neural theory of metaphor got its real impetus from three Berkeley dissertations done in 1997 – by Srini Narayanan, Joe Grady, and Christopher Johnson. Narayanan’s dissertation was key. He modeled metaphors as neural mappings and formulated certain metaphors for international economics. He then showed that the results of source domain inferences from the domain of physical motion and action are mapped onto the international economics target domain, interact with the logic of the target domain, and produce metaphorical inferences.

Johnson studied metaphor acquisition in young children and found three stages: (1) source domain only; (2) in domains where the source and target domains were both active (“conﬂated”), children learned to use source domain words with target domain meanings and grammar, then later (3 ) used the words metaphorically.
Putting together the Johnson and Narayanan results yields the following hypothesis: in situations where the source and target domains are both active simultaneously, the two areas of the brain for the source and target domains will both be active. Via the Hebbian principle that Neurons that ﬁre together wire together, neural mapping circuits linking the two domains will be learned. Those circuits constitute the metaphor.
Grady called such metaphors “primary metaphors” and observed that they are learned by the hundreds the same way all over the world because people have the same bodies and basically the same relevant environments. Therefore, we will have very much the same experiences in childhood in which two domains are simultaneously active, and so we will learn neural metaphorical mappings linking those domains naturally, just by functioning in the world. Just living an everyday life gives you the experience and suitable brain activations to give rise to a huge system of the same primary metaphorical mappings that are learned around the world without any awareness.
By best ﬁt, different cultural frames will combine with those primary metaphors and give rise to different metaphor systems. The Love Is a Journey metaphor is a good example. The primary metaphors that ground the Love Is a Journey metaphor are
r Purposes are Destinations: Every day there is a correlation between achieving a purpose and reaching a destination, as when you have to go to the refrigerator to get a piece of fruit or a cold beer.
r Difﬁculties are Impediments to Motion: A difﬁculty is something that inhibits your achievement of some purpose,

THE NEURAL THEORY OF METAPHOR

27

which is metaphorically reaching a destination. Hence, difﬁculties are conceptualized metaphorically as impediments to motion to a destination. r A Relationship is a Container (a Bounded Region of Space): People who are closely related tend to live, work, or otherwise spend time in the same enclosed space – your family in your home, your coworkers at the ofﬁce, and so on. r Intimacy is Closeness: The people you are most intimate with are typically the people you have spent time physically close to: your family, spouse, lover, and so on.
In each case, a correlation in experience is realized in the brain as the co-activation of distinct neural areas, which leads to the formation of circuits linking those areas.
A Structural Prediction. The neural theory says that complex metaphors that are extensions of existing primary metaphors bound together should be easier to learn and understand than conceptual metaphors that are totally new – since they just involve new binding and other connecting circuitry over existing conceptual metaphors. They should also seem more natural.
Take, for example, the sentence My job is a jail.
1. A jail restricts someone’s freedom of motion to desired external destinations, thus producing frustration and other negative emotions.
2. The metaphors that Achieving a Purpose is Reaching a Destination and Actions are Motions exist in our conceptual system.
3 . Binding the restriction on freedom of motion to Actions are Motions, we infer a restriction on freedom of action.
4. Binding desired external destinations to Achieving a Purpose is Reaching a Destination, we infer achieving external purposes.
5 . My Job is a jail metaphorically infers that my job restricts my freedom of action in achieving external purposes, thus producing frustration and other emotions.

Thus, given the existing system, maximization of binding produces the meaning of the sentence. We predict that this should be easy to understand and to process.
Compare this sentence with a sentence like My job is an aardvark. An aardvark is an African animal with a long proboscis that eats ants by sticking its proboscis in anthills. There are no primary metaphors in our normal conceptual systems that provide a natural metaphorical interpretation for this sentence. However, that sentence can be metonymic, say, when said by a zookeeper whose job is taking care of an aardvark. The metonymy is In the Animal Keeper Frame, The Animal stands for The Job of Taking care of that Animal.
The neural theory in general predicts that the most immediate component metaphors for a complex metaphor will be activated and used in the mapping. In short, in most cases, new conceptual metaphors that are easy to learn and make sense of are using conceptual mappings that preexist, frame-based knowledge that preexists, and adding connections in the form of circuitry that binds, links, maps, extends, and forms gestalts.
A Processing Prediction. The neural theory of metaphor makes an important prediction in the case of conventional conceptual metaphorical mappings that are realized by ﬁxed brain circuitry. When you hear a metaphorical expression, the literal meanings of the words should activate the source domain circuitry and the context should activate the target domain circuitry, and together they should activate the mapping circuit. The result is an integrated circuit, with activation of both source and target domains and processing over both at once. Thus, understanding language that makes use of a conventional conceptual metaphor should take no longer than normal frame-based nonmetaphorical processing. This result has been shown repeatedly, as in the example, My job is a jail.
The neural theory thus contradicts old two-step theories (before conceptual metaphor theory) that claim that the source domain is processed ﬁrst and then the mapping operates to process the target domain.

28

GEORGE LAKOFF

Time of processing studies contradict this view.
Asymmetry. Each neuron ﬁres asymmetrically, with the ﬂow of ions from the cell body down the axon, spreading out from there. Different neurons have different ﬁring capacities, depending on the receptors at the synapses that regulate ion ﬂow. Those neurons that ﬁre more tend to develop greater ﬁring capacities. And those involved in physical bodily functioning tend to ﬁre more. For this reason, the metaphorical maps learned are asymmetric and tend to have physical source domains (though some have social source domains).
The literature abounds with obvious examples.
r More Is Up: Our bodies are constantly monitoring physical height more than computing abstract quantity.
r Affection Is Warmth: Temperature is always there to be monitored; affection isn’t.
r Intimacy Is Closeness: We constantly monitor how close we are to objects, more than we judge intimacy.
The preponderance of our system of primary metaphors is acquired in childhood, and childhood experience has an important inﬂuence on the system of primary metaphors that we learn. Consider the following important examples:
r Governing Institutions are Families: Our ﬁrst experience with being governed is in our family. Thus, the social domain of the family will be used more when the metaphor is learned.
r Speech Act Force is Physical Force: Parents teach their young children by manipulating their bodies as they give directives. Thus, verbal directives are learned as having a “force.”
r Arguments are Struggles: All small children struggle with their parents when their parents guide them physically in teaching them how to behave. Early verbal arguments are commonly about meeting behavioral expectations. As we grow

up and learn about wars and battles, the source domain of struggle is specialized and expanded to battles and wars.
During learning, much of the abstract domain is structured by ﬁxed projections from the embodied domain. When processing source domain words in the context of a target domain subject matter, the ﬁxed connections result in co-activation of the two domains. Thus, source domain activations arising from inferences are projected onto the target domain via the preestablished mapping.
The Use of Conceptual Metaphors
The preneural theory of conceptual metaphor was vague on a number of details. Metaphors were cross-domain mappings – from a frame in one domain to another domain, also structured by frames. Such mappings were seen as applied to target domain situations as understood in the context of commonplace information. Inferences were mapped from the source to target situation, with as much as possible frame and image-schema structure “preserved” from the source domain. Thus, in use, you had:
r The metaphorical mapping (from source domain frame to target domain frame).
r The speciﬁc situation being discussed, ﬁtting the target domain.
r Target domain commonplace information.
r Source domain commonplace information.
Metaphorical inferences took (1) source domain inferences, (2) mappings of the results of such inferences to the target domain frames; (3 ) combining of those mapped inferences with target domain information to give new “metaphorical” inferences.
The neural theory of metaphor provides an explanatory mechanism for metaphorical inferences that can be modeled precisely (Narayanan, 1997) using neural

THE NEURAL THEORY OF METAPHOR

29

computational modeling. At the heart of the modeling of metaphorical inferences is the notion of mental simulation, which represents speciﬁc situations. Let us look ﬁrst at inferences in NTL, and then at metaphorical inferences.
Inferences
A meaningful node in a neural circuit is a node that can activate a mental simulation.
An inference occurs when:
r the activation of a collection of meaningful nodes (the antecedent situation) in a neural circuit leads to the activation of one or more other meaningful nodes (the consequence);
r when the activation of the antecedent nodes is necessary for the consequence;
r and when the inhibition of one or more consequence nodes results in the inhibition of one or more antecedent nodes.

1. the vehicle the travelers are in is going a lot faster than usual,
2. the driving is exciting, and 3 . it can be dangerous (the travelers can
suffer physical harm).
“Freeway of love” activates the target domain of love and source domain of travel, resulting in the activation of the Love Is a Journey metaphorical mapping. The metaphorical inferences are that:
M1. the relationship the lovers are in is developing a lot faster than usual,
M2. the development of the relationship is exciting, and
M3 . it can be dangerous (the lovers can suffer psychological harm).
These inferences are activated when the circuitry is activated in the processing of the sentence. The totality of source domain inferences does not have to proceed before any of the target domain inferences.

Inferences are simply consequences of the meaningfulness of nodes in simulation semantics, the spreading of activation, and best-ﬁt constraints (the consequences ﬁt the antecedents best). Recall that the maximization of binding is one of the characteristics of the best-ﬁt property of any neural system. In short, maximizing binding can lead to inferences.
Metaphorical Inferences
A metaphorical inference occurs when:
r a metaphorical mapping is activated in a neural circuit,
r there is an inference in the source domain of the mapping,
r and a consequence of the source domain inference is mapped to the target domain, activating a meaningful node.
For example, suppose the sentence is We’re driving in the fast lane on the freeway of love. In the travel domain, driving in the fast lane on the freeway activates the inferences that

Mapping “Gaps”
A mapping gap occurs when there is a metaphorical mapping, but part of the source domain frame has no correlate in the target domain. For example, take the sentence I gave Sam that idea. In this metaphor, the communication of an idea is the transfer of an object from the speaker to the hearer.
A. Source domain knowledge: the giver loses the object when he gives it to the recipient.
B. Target domain knowledge: the speaker does not lose the idea when he gives it to the listener.
Because we know (B) about the target domain, no mapping from (A) to (B) can be learned. Thus, what appears to be a “gap” is not a gap; it is just that an impossible mapping does not take place in the learning of the metaphor. Recall that the learning of the metaphor involves repeated co-activation of the corresponding source and target nodes, and the absence of such

30

GEORGE LAKOFF

co-activation implies that no such maps are learned.
Image-Schema “Preservation”
As Regier (1995 , 1997) and Dodge and Lakoff (2006) have argued, primitive imageschemas (e.g., container, source-path-goal, degree of closeness, direction, and amount of force) are computed by brain structures that are either innate or form early. Action schemas and frames are structured using such primitive image-schemas. For example, putting in makes use of the container schema, the source-path-goal schema, a force schema, a direction schema, and an aspectual schema.
Metaphorical putting in – as in The Founding Fathers put freedom of speech into the Constitution – uses physical putting-in as a source domain. The inference patterns of those schemas as bound together in the source domain are then used in metaphorical inferences. For example, if you put something into a physical container, it isn’t there before you put it in and it is there afterward and it remains there until something happens to remove it. That is also true of the freedoms the Founding Fathers put into the Constitution.
In preneural theories of conceptual metaphor, we spoke of “preservation” of source domain image-schemas. In the neural theory, it is the use of source domain imageschemas in inferences about target domain situations.
Mental Spaces
A “mental space” from an NTL perspective is a mental simulation characterizing an understanding of a situation, real or imagined. The entire space is governed by a gestalt node, which makes the mental space an “entity” which, when activated, activates all the elements of the mental space.
Blending
What is called “blending” is a matter of neural binding. Consider the monk blend. There are two mental spaces each structured by

frames. In each, there is a mountain and a path. On day 1, the monk walks up the path to the top of the mountain, sleeps overnight there, and on day 2, the monk walks down the same path to the bottom
Day 1 is one mental space; day 2 is another. The blend consists of bindings and a gestalt circuit. The mountain on day 1 is bound to the mountain on day 2, the path on day 1 to the path on day 2, the monk on day 1 to the monk on day 2. A gestalt node forms a single blend out of the two spaces with the bindings.
Question: Is there a single place on the path where the monk is located at the same time on both days?
Answer: Yes. Where he meets himself. We have formed a single integrated circuit containing both mental spaces, with two instances of the monk, one going up and the other coming down the mountain. Being on the same path, the up-going monk will “meet” the down-going monk in the simulation created by the bindings at some place and time. Note that there is no metaphor here.
Metaphors versus Blends
A metaphor is a mapping. A blend is an instance of one or more neural bindings.
Metaphors don’t occur in isolation nor do bindings. A contextual interpretation of an utterance includes both general knowledge and target domain knowledge. The overall use of metaphor involves some bindings and inferences in the source domain, bindings and inferences in the target domain, activation of metaphoric maps, and the activation of other connected nodes that characterize related knowledge (Fauconnier & Turner, 2002; Grady et al., 1999). What is called the “blend” is other overall set of bindings in the simulation that characterizes the meaning of the sentence.
To see the difference between metaphors and blends, consider the metaphor More Is Up. In a sentence like The temperature went up, we are understanding quantity in terms of verticality. But they are different things. Amount of heat in itself is not vertical.

THE NEURAL THEORY OF METAPHOR

31

But in a thermometer oriented vertically, the mercury goes up physically as the temperature increases (metaphorically goes up). The thermometer is an object that, in its very physical construction, is intended to be understood in terms of both a binding and a metaphor. The metaphor, but not the blend, is in the sentence The temperature went up.
Thus, metaphors exist separate from blends. Such metaphoric blends are formed when a source and a target element of a metaphor are bound together via neural binding.
Let’s consider another contrast. Suppose you are explaining arithmetic to a child. You draw a line. And you say, “Think of a number as being a point on this line. Say this is zero. And to get to one you take a step from 0 to 1, located here on the line. To add 3 to 1 you take three steps from 1, like this, and you get to 4. To subtract 1 from 4, you take a step backward, and you get to 3 .” And so on. Here, you are just using the metaphor that numbers are points on a line. It is just a metaphor. No blending.
But if you go to the Cartesian plane where you have a number line, then you not only have the metaphor of numbers as points on a line, but you have a binding as well: the number and the point on the line are identical – the same entity! This metaphorical blend is actually in the mathematics of the Cartesian plane.
Again, a mere metaphor (understanding the target in terms of the source) is crucially different from that metaphor plus a binding of source entities to target entities.
Optimality in Blending
A great deal follows from the understanding of blending as neural binding, given that neural systems work by spreading activation and best-ﬁt principles. Best-ﬁt principles include the maximization of binding, and the maximal use of conventional frames, metaphors, commonplace knowledge, and context. Maximizing neural binding means a maximal integration of all these elements and “emergent” inferences resulting from the “mixing” of inference-determining elements (e.g., from source and target domains).

The result is a set of predictions about blends – exactly the well-known properties of optimal blends:
r Integration: The scenario in the blended space should be a well-integrated scene.
Each neural binding across conceptual structures serves to “integrate” those conceptual structures.
r Web: Tight connections between the blend and the inputs should be maintained, so that an event in one of the input spaces, for instance, is construed as implying a corresponding event in the blend.
Such correspondences are given by maps, either metaphorical maps or maps connecting mental spaces (that is, simulations).
r Unpacking: It should be easy to reconstruct the inputs and the network of connections, given the blend.
Neural bindings have the property that they can be “relaxed”; that is, the bound structures can be conceptualized without the binding, as when you can separate off the blueness of a blue square and think of it as red.
r Topology: Elements in the blend should participate in the same sorts of relations as their counterparts in the inputs.
This follows immediately since a structure with an added neural binding has all the relations as the structure without that neural binding.
r Good Reason: If an element appears in the blend, it should have meaning. And if it arises by inference, it will be tied into the logic of the blend.
Since blends apply to simulations, and simulations have meaning, this follows immediately.
r Metonymic Tightening: Relationships between elements from the same input

32

GEORGE LAKOFF

should become as close as possible within the blend. For instance, western images of personiﬁed Death often depict the ﬁgure as a skeleton, thus closely associating the event of death with an object that, in our more literal understandings, is indirectly but saliently associated with it.
These are simply cases of a metonymy plus a neural binding of the source with the target of the metonymy.
Thus, all of the optimality properties producing “good” blends are explained by simulation semantics, spreading activation, and best ﬁt, which governs optimality in biological neural networks.
Emergence
Emergence is the occurrence in a blend of an entity or proposition that does not exist in any of the blend “inputs.” Emergence is explained by inference in neural systems. Maps and blends across conceptual structures can give rise to inferences not present in any “input.”
Consider the example, In France, Clinton’s affair wouldn’t have mattered. In the blend, Clinton, the American chief executive, is bound to the position of the French chief executive in France. Since the French don’t care about politicians’ sexual liaisons, we get the inference that “In France, Clinton’s affair wouldn’t have mattered.” This “emergent” inference does not occur in either of the inputs: France, where Clinton was not chief executive of France, and the United States, where Clinton’s affair did matter. It arises by neural binding and inference.
BETTER ANALYSES WITH
METAPHORIC BLENDS
Certain classic analyses in the blending literature which are seen as nonmetaphoric blends really should be seen as metaphoric blends. For example, there is a common metaphor in which Breaking a Record Is Winning a Race Against the Previous Record-holder. Thus, a few years ago when Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa were both attempting to break Babe Ruth’s home run record, the press represented the situation

metaphorically as a race with Ruth – and each other. In the daily papers, McGwire and Sosa were represented by how many games they were “behind” or “ahead” of Ruth’s 60 homerun performance. They were spoken of as “catching up” or “falling behind.” The classic blending analysis misses this metaphor.
The same metaphor occurred in the situation many years back when the yacht Great America tried to break the San Francisco to Boston record through the Northwest Passage set 100 years before by the yacht Northern Light. Accordingly, the metaphor had the Great America in a “race” with the Northern Light, even though they sailed 100 years apart. The newspapers daily reported how many days “ahead” of the Northern Light the Great America was. Again, the classic blending analysis misses the metaphor.
The moral: A neural theory analysis forces us to notice analyses we might otherwise miss.
Let’s consider another class of cases with the same moral. There are two widely used metaphors rarely analyzed as such.
r A Person who performs actions with certain characteristics is a Member of a Profession known for those characteristics.
Here, the mapping is from the frame of a member of a profession, with the characteristics that members of a profession are known by. Special cases, for example, a surgeon frame expands the general frame with the values ﬁlled in one way, while a butcher frame expands the general frame with the values ﬁlled in another way.
In each case, the source domain of the metaphor is a stereotype, represented as a frame whose semantic roles include kinds of characteristics. For example, a surgeon is known for being precise with beneﬁcial results, while a butcher is known for being sloppy and acting more with force than with care, with messy results. Thus, we can say
r My lawyer presented my case with surgical skill.
r My lawyer butchered my case.

THE NEURAL THEORY OF METAPHOR

33

In the ﬁrst, the lawyer was careful and skillful, with beneﬁcial results. In the second, the lawyer was careless, sloppy, and heavyhanded, with messy results. Other examples can be quite diverse:
r Ichiro slices singles through the inﬁeld like a surgeon.
r Frank Thomas hacks at the ball like a butcher.
This very general metaphor accounts for the classical examples:
r My butcher is a surgeon. r My surgeon was a butcher.
The ﬁrst case says the butcher cuts meat with the care of a surgeon, while the second says that my surgeon handled my surgery in a careless, sloppy, and heavy-handed way.
A second example like this is the commonplace metaphor:
r A Person with characteristic properties is an Animal known for those properties.
Classic cases include Man is a wolf, Our new salesman is a tiger, Harry’s a pig, and You’re trying to weasel out of this. All examples use a stereotype of an animal, and we understand the person in terms of the characteristics of the animal stereotype.
There have been attempts to understand such cases nonmetaphorically, just in terms of bindings based on similarity. Such an approach would claim that there is no conventional metaphor at all and that all such cases are literal blends based on similar properties. We can see what is wrong with this approach by looking at cases outside the proposed conventional metaphors we just discussed. Consider sentences such as
r My surgeon is a Russian. r My butcher is a Russian. r My lawyer is a Russian.
There are common stereotypes of Russians, say, that they are very sentimental and emotional, sometimes to the point of losing control. If the blending approach were correct, we would expect these sentences to act like The butcher is a surgeon and The

surgeon is a butcher. Just as the butcher isn’t literally a surgeon by profession, nor is the surgeon literally a butcher by profession, so you would expect these sentences to be saying that the surgeon, butcher, and lawyer were not literally Russian by nationality; but they do say that. In addition, you would expect them to say that the surgery, butchering, and law practice are carried out in an overly sentimental, emotional, almost out-of-control way. But the sentences do not say that. The “Russian” sentences are literal and work just as you would expect literal sentences to work. The surgeonbutcher sentences are metaphorical, using conventional conceptual metaphors, and they work accordingly.
I conclude that the metaphor approach is accurate for cases like the surgeon-butcher and animal examples and the blending approach is not. Blends are real and result from neural bindings, mental spaces, and metaphors. But there is no reason to believe that there is a neural operation of “blending” in addition.
THE ROLE OF METAPHOR
IN ABSTRACT CONCEPTS
In Whose Freedom? I argue that metaphor is central to the core concept of freedom and that this abstract concept is actually grounded in bodily experience.
Physical freedom is freedom to move – to go places, to reach for and get objects, and to perform actions. Physical freedom is deﬁned in a frame in which there are potential impediments to freedom to move: blockages, being weighed down, being held back, being imprisoned, lack of energy or other resources, absence of a path providing access, being physically restrained from movement, and so on. Freedom of physical motion occurs when none of these potential impediments is present.
Various metaphors turn freedom of physical motion into freedom to achieve one’s goals. The event structure metaphor, for instance, characterizes achieving a purpose as reaching a desired destination, or getting a desired object. Freedom to achieve one’s purposes then becomes, via the event structure metaphor, the absence of any

34

GEORGE LAKOFF

metaphorical impediments to motion. Other ideas, like political freedom and freedom of the will, build on that concept.
The concept of political freedom is characterized via a network of concepts that necessarily includes the event structure metaphor and the inferences that arise via that metaphor. The ultimate grounding of the concept of political freedom is visceral, arising from the experience of not being free to move and the frustration that engenders.
What is the role of metaphor in our concept of political freedom? Our understanding of conceptual systems in terms of neural systems shows that conceptual metaphor is used in our understanding of political freedom but indirectly.
METAPHOR IN SYSTEMS OF THOUGHT
In Philosophy in the Flesh, Mark Johnson and I argue that philosophical systems of thought rest on a relatively small number of metaphors treated as ultimate truths and used constantly in reasoning. The neural theory of metaphor allows us to understand more about such systems and people who think in terms of them most of every day.
Because the fundamental metaphors are used constantly, the synaptic strengths in the metaphors become very strong and resistant to change. Second, spreading activation and best-ﬁt properties (including maximization of binding) make such systems highly integrated, tightly connected, with many inferences. As a result, such a system will dominate your thought, your understanding of the world, and your actions.
One will tend to see the world through the system; one will tend to construct neural simulations to ﬁt the system; one will tend to plan the future using the system; and one will deﬁne common sense through the system. The system will tend to make experiences and facts consistent with it noticeable and important, and experiences and facts inconsistent with it invisible.
This is especially true in politics, where progressive and conservative thought are each deﬁned by a central metaphor and a system of thought that ﬁts it (see my Moral Politics).

By far the most detailed study of the role of metaphor in a system of thought is Rafael Nu´ n˜ ez’s and my book, Where Mathematics Comes From, which shows in great detail how many branches of higher mathematics are built up via layers of metaphor from embodied concepts.
METAPHORICAL LANGUAGE
The neural theory of language allows us to understand better why language is so powerful. Let’s start with words. Every word is deﬁned via linking circuit to an element of a frame – a semantic role. Because every frame is structured by a gestalt circuit, the activation of that frame element results in the activation of the entire frame. Now, the frame will most likely contain one or more imageschemas, a scenario containing other frames, a presupposition containing other frames, may ﬁt into and activate a system of other frames, and each of these frames may be structured by conceptual metaphors. All of those structures could be activated simply by the activation of that one frame element that deﬁnes the meaning of the given word. In addition, the lexical frame may be in the source domain of a metaphor. In that case, the word could also activate that metaphor. In the right context, all of these activated structures can result in inferences.
Let’s suppose a word activates a network of frames, images-schemas, and metaphors. The metaphors may be only indirectly linked to the frame directly activated by the word. Is that word an instance of “metaphorical language”? That is not how the term is usually used.
We usually speak of metaphorical language when
r the frame element the word designates is in the source domain frame of the given metaphor,
r the subject matter under discussion is in the target domain of that metaphor.
Thus, up in the sentence Prices went up, activates the verticality frame, prices activates the quantity frame, and together they activate the More is Up metaphor.

THE NEURAL THEORY OF METAPHOR

35

In addition, the word up – by virtue of the metaphorical mapping – acquires a link to the quantity frame, where it activates greater quantity.
Does up in Prices went up always activate the More is Up? It depends. In our neural systems, the More is Up metaphor is always present in the neural system, always physically linked to the concept of greater quantity – connected and ready to be activated. But it is possible for the metaphorical mapping to be inhibited and for up to be directly activated. However, when a graph of prices physically rises, then the More is Up metaphor is activated, as it is in a sentence like Prices reached a new peak, where reach and peak activate the concept of Motion Upward.
Grammar can also play a role in activating a metaphor, as in the expression freeway of love, in which the construction sanctions an interpretation in which the head noun freeway comes from the source domain (travel) and object of the preposition love comes from the target domain. Grammatical constructions come with metaphorical constraints, as Karen Sullivan has observed. Compare bright student versus *intelligent light: the modiﬁer (bright) is from the source domain, while the head (student) is from the target domain; but the reverse doesn’t work – except in a special class of cases, like emotional intelligence, where the modiﬁer is a nonpredicative adjective that deﬁnes a domain (emotion).
All this is natural in a neural theory because of the connectivity involved. The form elements (words and grammatical categories) are neurally linked to the elements in conceptual system, where metaphorical mappings are linked to frame elements, which are linked to words or grammatical categories.
Consider a poetic metaphor like Dylan Thomas’s line, Do not go gently into that good night. The line does not overtly mention death as the subject matter, but the line contains three words that each evoke a source domain frame in a metaphor for death: go as in Death is Departure; gently as in Life is a Struggle; and night as in A Lifetime is a

Day and Death is Night. This is natural from a neural perspective. Each word activates a frame element in a frame go, gently, night. The three frames are thereby activated and each provides some activation to the corresponding metaphors for Death. This is reinforced by the fact that the sentence does not have a direct literal meaning, in which each of these words is used literally. But the source domain meanings do important work in constructing a metaphorical image of a man moving into the night ready to ﬁght. The next line, Rage, rage against the dying of the light uses dying metaphorically in the sense of light ceasing to exist. But the activation via the metaphor of source domain of death reinforces the interpretation of the ﬁrst line. This use of “activation” makes sense in the neural model.
The Use of Metaphoric Language
The neural theory of metaphor also makes sense of the use of metaphoric language in context. We know that metaphor does not reside in words but in ideas. This is especially clear from cases of metaphorical ambiguity, where the same words evoke different readings using different metaphors. “It’s all downhill from here” may in a given situation meaning “it’s getting easier” (Ease of Action Is Ease of Motion) or “it’s getting worse” (Down is Bad). Either conceptual metaphor can apply to the spatial meaning of “down” in “downhill.” In a neural account, both metaphors are connected to the spatial meaning of “down,” but the metaphors are mutually inhibitory. Only one can be activated, depending on context.
Consider a metaphorically ambiguous sentence like “Let’s move the meeting ahead two days.” If uttered on a Wednesday, it could refer to either Monday or Friday, depending on which metaphor for time is used – moving-ego or moving-time. Since they are mutually contradictory, the metaphors are mutually inhibitory. The neural theory can explain Lera Boroditsky’s classic experiment at San Francisco airport. She showed that, for people waiting for a plane to come in, the motion of the plane toward

36

GEORGE LAKOFF

them primed the moving time metaphor and they gave the answer “Monday,” two days ahead of the moving time. Those who were on the plane and coming off were primed by being on the moving object, and they gave the answer “Friday,” two days ahead of the moving ego.
The neural theory explains the priming in these cases. The two time metaphors are mutually inhibitory. What tips the scales is the priming – the neural activation of either a moving time or moving ego in the spatial domain.
What Makes Metaphorical Language Meaningful?
Language is meaningful when the ideas it expresses are meaningful. Conceptual metaphors are meaningful when they are grounded. They are grounded, ﬁrst, by source domain embodiment, and second by the embodiment of the source and target domains of the primary metaphors being used.
SUMMARY: WHAT DOES THE NEURAL
THEORY PROVIDE?
The neural theory provides a much better understanding of how thought and language work and of how metaphorical thought ﬁts into the picture. It also provides explanations for a host of phenomena. And it changes how one does metaphor analysis – and redeﬁnes what metaphor analysis is.
The neural theory explains:
r Why there should be conceptual metaphor at all; what conceptual metaphors are physically; why we have the primary metaphors we have, how the system is grounded, and why certain conceptual metaphors are widespread around the world.
r How metaphorical inferences work; why they should exist; how they operate in context, and how they interact with simulations.
r All of the properties of the old metaphor theory, the theory as described by myself and Mark Johnson in Metaphors We Live

By and by myself in the essay “The Contemporary Theory of Metaphor.” r How metaphors can function indirectly in the characterization of abstract concepts. r How a small number of metaphors can organize a whole system of thought and become the principles on which one lives one’s life. r How metaphorical language works as a simple extension of non-metaphorical language. r Why metaphors differ from blends, and why blends do not do the job of metaphors.
The neural theory also clariﬁes what the study of metaphor is about, namely,
r showing how metaphorical understanding is grounded in basic human experience via primary conceptual metaphors;
r showing how primary metaphors contribute to complex conceptual metaphors;
r showing how both primary and complex metaphors contribute to the meanings of words, complex expressions, and grammatical constructions;
r showing how conceptual metaphor plays a role in abstract concepts and overall conceptual systems (as in politics, philosophy, and mathematics);
r and, ﬁnally, showing how conceptual metaphors contribute to the understanding of language and other uses of symbols.
HOW DOES A METAPHOR ANALYST MAKE
USE OF ALL THIS?
Metaphor analysts rarely know neural computation, and they shouldn’t be expected to. The Neural Theory of Language Project has ﬁgured out a way to let linguists be linguists and not computer or brain scientists. We have invented a notation that correlates with circuitry with the appropriate computational properties but can be used by analysts without worrying about the computational details. Thus, consider a notation such as:

THE NEURAL THEORY OF METAPHOR

37

Metaphor: LoveIsAJourney Source Domain: Journey Target Domain: Love

Mapping:

Travelers

→ Lovers

Vehicle

→ Relationship

Destinations

→ LifeGoals

ImpedimentsToMotion → Difﬁculties

by algorithm to computational neural modeling programs that, say, take a sentence as input and produce an analysis as output. There are corresponding formalisms for grammatical and lexical constructions, metonymies, frames, image-schemas, and so on. The technical term for the notational system is Embodied Construction Grammar.

Evokes:

Conclusion

Purposes Are Destinations Metaphor, with Destinations = Self.Source. Destinations Purposes = Self.Target.LifeGoals
Difﬁculties Are Impediments to Motion Metaphor,
With Impediments to Motion = Self.Source.ImpedimentsToMotion
Difﬁculties = Self.Target.Difﬁculties
Intimacy Is Closeness Metaphor, With Closeness = Self.Source. ClosenessOf TravelersInVehicle Intimacy = Self.Target. IntimacyOfLovers
A Relationship Is A Container Metaphor, With Container = Self.Source.Vehicle Relationship = Self.Target.Relationship
The statement that this is a metaphor corresponds to the appropriate mapping circuit. The name of the metaphor corresponds to the appropriate gestalt node. The arrows (“→”) correspond to linking circuits. The statement of the mapping speciﬁes what maps to what. The equal signs (“ = ”) specify the neural bindings. The “evokes” statement sets up linking circuits activating the “component” metaphors, with neural bindings between LoveIsAJourney (called “Self ” in the formalism) and the various component metaphors. There can be, and often is, a chain of “evokes” statements that ultimately lead to primary metaphors that ground the metaphor system in experience.
This formalism is easy for metaphor analysts to learn and use. It can be converted

This is where we are in the neural theory of metaphor as of November 2006. We have a reasonable early approximation to the kinds of computations that neuronal groups must perform to characterize frames, metaphors, metonymies, mental spaces, and blends. A parsing program to use these kinds of computations is being constructed. Thousands of frames and hundreds of metaphors have been analyzed informally to date and can readily be converted to the notation system. And we know enough about natural metaphor learning to understand how the metaphor system gets built up just by functioning in our everyday lives.
The neural theory of metaphor changes cognitive linguistics vastly, not the analyses themselves so much, but our understanding of how metaphor systems work.

CHAPTER 2
Philosophy’s Debt to Metaphor
Mark Johnson

What’s at Issue in the Question of Metaphor?
Philosophy’s debt to metaphor is profound and immeasurable. Without metaphor, there would be no philosophy. However, philosophy’s debt is no greater, nor less, than that of any other signiﬁcant human intellectual ﬁeld or discipline. Philosophers must use the same conceptual resources possessed by any human being, and the potential for any philosophy to make sense of a person’s life depends directly on the fact that all of us are metaphoric animals.
What I have just said is not now, nor has it ever been, widely accepted by philosophers. In fact, for the major part of our philosophical history, the idea that metaphor lies at the heart of human conceptualization and reasoning has been rejected.1 One could even make a crude distinction between two types of philosophy – objectivist/literalist philosophies that see metaphor as a dispensable linguistic appurtenance and those that see philosophies

as creative elaborations of basic conceptual metaphors.
The history of western philosophy is, for the most part, one long development of the objectivist dismissal of metaphor, punctuated rarely by bold declarations of the pervasiveness of metaphor in thought, of which Nietzsche is the most famous proponent. Where a philosopher stands on this key issue can be determined by their answer to one question: are our abstract concepts deﬁned by metaphor, or not? Once the question is formulated in this manner, it is easy to see the profound philosophical stakes at issue. If our most fundamental abstract concepts – such as those for causation, events, will, thought, reason, knowledge, mind, justice, and rights – are irreducibly metaphoric, then philosophy must consist in the analysis, criticism, and elaboration of the metaphorical concepts out of which philosophies are made. If, on the other hand, you believe that our most important philosophical concepts are, in the ﬁnal analysis, literal, then you will

39

40

MARK JOHNSON

regard metaphor as cognitively insigniﬁcant, and you will relegate it to what you disparagingly regard as some distant corner of philosophy, typically the unfairly maligned ﬁeld of aesthetics.
Anyone who thinks that there is really nothing very important at stake here should consider the following. There are a number of perennial philosophical questions that arise over and over again throughout history any time you reﬂect on the nature of human experience. These are questions such as What is mind, and how does it work? What does it mean to be a person? Is there such a thing as human will, and is it free? What is the nature of reality? What can I know, and how can I go about gaining that knowledge? What things or states are “good” and should therefore be pursued? Are certain actions morally required of us? Does God exist (and what difference would it make)? Is there any meaning to human existence, or is life absurd? Both the framing of these questions and the kinds of answers we give to them depend on metaphor. You cannot address any of these questions without engaging metaphor. Consequently, an adequate philosophy must include an extensive inquiry into the workings of metaphor and how it shapes our most important philosophical ideas.
Philosophical Concepts Are Metaphoric
From a practical standpoint, it is obviously not possible to make an exhaustive survey showing that all our philosophical concepts are deﬁned by conceptual metaphors. Instead, I will examine one key concept – causation – to indicate its metaphorical constitution, and I will point to research suggesting that we use metaphors to deﬁne all of our abstract concepts and thus all of our philosophical concepts.
I have selected causation as the exemplary metaphorically deﬁned concept because it is hard to imagine a metaphysical concept that is more fundamental than that of cau-

sation. It lies at the heart of all of the sciences, is pervasive in our folk theories of the world, and is a philosophical lynchpin of virtually every ontology. When the ﬁrst substantial metaphor analysis of our causal concepts emerged within cognitive linguistics over a decade ago, it became clear that the implications of this research were stunning. In my own analytic philosophical training, most of the books and articles I read assumed science to be a superior form of knowledge, partly because of its ability to give causal explanations of events. In one philosophical treatise after another, I was struck by how philosophers referred to “causes” as if they were objective forces or entities and as if there existed basically one kind of natural causation (as revealed in expressions such as “X caused Y” and “The cause of Y is X”). In an attempt to explain human actions, many philosophers also spoke of “agent causality,” in order to carve out a space for human “willing,” but in physical nature, natural causes ruled the day. So, there seemed to be at least one type of cause (i.e., physical) but not more than two types (adding agent causation to physical causation), and both conceptions were thought to be literal, not metaphorical. Causes were alleged to be literal entities or forces in the world.
This picture, as we will see, turns out to be mistaken, and badly so. It is a mistake that has disastrous consequences. To see why this is so, let’s begin with an analysis of one of our most often used concepts of causation – that of causation as a physical force. Once detailed analyses were performed on the semantics of our causal terms, the metaphorical nature of this concept became quite evident. In cognitive linguistics, the study of causal concepts emerged from the study of how people conceptualize events generally. The ﬁrst prominent conceptual metaphor involved an understanding of change of state as (metaphorical) motion from one location to another, according to the following general mapping:2

States Change of states
Causes Causation Actions
Purposes Means to ends Difﬁculties

The location event-structure metaphor comprises a vast complex system of several submappings, each of which is what Grady (1997) calls a “primary” metaphor. In English, the semantics of our terms for events is given by the detailed structure of the mapping. Each submapping supports a large number of expressions whose dependence on metaphor goes largely unnoticed in our ordinary discourse. For example, the submapping Change Of State Is Movement underlies expressions such as “The water went from hot to cold,” “The system is moving toward homeostasis,” and “The pizza is somewhere between warm and cold.” Causation Is Forced Movement is evident in “The ﬁre brought the soup to a boil,” “His treachery pushed the King over the edge,” “The candidate’s speech threw the crowd into a frenzy.”
Notice how these submappings code various dimensions of what linguists call aspect, which concerns the means and manner of an action. For instance, we say, “the stove brought the water to a boil” but not *“the stove threw the water to a boil,” for a very good reason. In the source domain of physical forces and motions, to “bring” something to someone is to apply continuous force to an object to move it from one location to another, causing it to end up in that

person’s possession. When metaphorically extended to causation in general, the semantics of bring thus entails continuous application of force to bring about change of state. Thus, bringing water to a boil entails the constant heating of the water until it boils (i.e., until it arrives at the metaphorical boilingstate location). Throwing a physical object, by contrast, involves an initial application of strong force with the object continuing to move to a new location, even after the force is no longer applied. Thus, “threw,” according to the submapping, is not appropriate for the case of boiling water, though it is just the right term for “Babe Ruth’s homerun threw the crowd into a frenzy.”
Now, how could a literalist philosopher have any adequate account of the semantics of throw, as revealed in this case of Ruth’s home run? Will she say that there is a purely literal way to express the type of causation involved here? But there isn’t. If we say, “Babe Ruth’s homerun caused the crowd to get emotionally excited,” we lose the key semantic details expressed by “threw.” “Caused to get excited” does not capture the manner of the causation, which is rapid initial “force” followed by an extended trajectory after the initial event.
The crucial moral of this example is that the precise details of the semantics of basic causation terms are determined only by the submappings of the metaphors. The inferences we make about causal situations come from the metaphorical structure of our causation concepts. You cannot grasp the meaning of the causal terms, nor can you do appropriate causal reasoning, without the metaphors.
Moreover, the case of causation is even more complicated than it ﬁrst appears because there turn out to be many different metaphorical conceptions of types of causation. Analyses to date reveal upwards of twenty distinct metaphors that express twenty kinds of causation (Lakoff & Johnson, 1999). A brief survey of just a few of these additional metaphors is highly instructive. It smashes the illusion of core literal concepts of causation and of any objectivist

42

MARK JOHNSON

philosophy that pretends to be founded on such concepts.
Consider, for instance, a second major metaphor system for certain types of causation, one that conceives of change of state or having an attribute (or property) as the acquisition of a possession.

Purposes

The submapping Causation Is Transfer Of Possession is evident in expressions such as “Professor Johnson’s lecture on causation gave me a headache, but the aspirin took it away,” “Mary gave her cold to Janice,” and “Janice caught Mary’s cold.” Moreover, even our common philosophical notion of a “property” is based on this metaphorical mapping. What does it mean for an object to “possess” a property? When something has a property, it is in a certain state (deﬁned by that property). When something loses that property, it no longer manifests the features appropriate to that property. Additionally, there are many other submappings within this causation metaphor that specify various ways of acquiring a desired object, which equates metaphorically with acquiring a certain property or attribute and thus achieving a purpose. For example, there is the submapping Achieving A Purpose Is Getting Food, as in “I’m hungry for advancement,” “All the best jobs were gobbled up early on,” and “It was a mouthwatering opportunity.” Each of the various ways we acquire food, such as hunting, ﬁshing, and agriculture, show up in the language of our purposeful action, as in
r Trying To Achieve A Purpose Is Hunting

“I’m still job hunting.” “She is aiming for rapid advancement in the ﬁrm.” “Larry bagged a promotion.” “That idea won’t hunt.”
r Trying To Achieve A Purpose Is Fishing
“Ann landed a big promotion.” “Before that, she had a line out for a new job.” “My boss is always ﬁshing for compliments.” “Every night he’s out trolling for a date.”
r Trying To Achieve A Purpose Is Agriculture
“Every worker should reap the fruits of his or her labor.” “That promotion is ripe for the picking.” “Harry’s been cultivating several job prospects.”
Metaphorically based expressions like these are not just colloquialisms, used loosely in ordinary talk. Once again, the submappings of the metaphor specify the precise details of the semantics of causation and determine what types of inferences we will make. Some people harbor the illusion that good science would merely avoid such expressions in causal explanations. But, as it turns out, there is no way to avoid the use of one or another basic causal metaphor in science, and scientists reason on the basis of the entailments of the submappings of these metaphors.
In the social sciences, for example, there are a number of quite speciﬁc metaphors that can be used for the types of causal explanation appropriate for the science of those ﬁelds. One especially common case is the causal path metaphor.

Examples: “Pot smoking leads to drug addiction.” “As a nation, we’re careening wildly down the road to destruction.” “That path will get you nowhere, man.” “You’re heading for catastrophe.”
The causal path metaphor plays a key role in certain types of causal explanation for human actions. It utilizes our common knowledge about motion through space to some destination: if you start down a certain path, you will naturally end up where that path leads you, unless something intervenes to retard or block your progress. Metaphorically, then, if you start down a certain “path” of action, it will typically lead you to a certain destination (end), unless something intervenes to retard or block your metaphorical movement. This argument is used by those who believe that certain actions or behaviors will necessitate a certain speciﬁc outcome in the ordinary course of events (as in the 195 0s song lyric, “I’ll tell you son, you’re gonna drive me to drinkin’, if you don’t stop drivin’ that hot rod Lincoln”). In politics, the causal path metaphor can be even more decisive. One often hears the argument that a certain thirdworld country is “on the road to democracy (read, capitalism),” so that, if we (the United States) will just eliminate any potential obstacles (i.e., we intervene politically, economically, militarily, or covertly), then that country will naturally and inevitably continue along the path to the desired endstate (namely, democracy!). Millions of dollars and sometimes even the lives of citizens are sacriﬁced to supposedly ensure the smooth unrestricted motion of some metaphorical entity (a country, an economy, or a political institution) along a metaphorical causal path to a metaphorically deﬁned destination.
Another important metaphor in political and economic debate is the plate tectonics metaphor for social/political/economic change, which is appropriated from the geology of plate tectonics. According to the logic of the metaphor, continual, long-term application of “pressure” to a system, institution, or state will eventually result in a rapid, mas-

sive causal consequence. The rapid, surprising disintegration of the Soviet Union is supposed by some to be a classic example of this process. Often, when large sustained infusions of funds or manpower do not appear to be producing the desired change in a government or economy (usually both), the plate tectonics metaphor is frequently invoked to argue for the continued commitment of resources by Congress, on the assumption that we need just a little bit more pressure to produce an eventual massive transformation.
The analysis of the full range of metaphors could be continued along similar lines. In Philosophy in the Flesh (1999), George Lakoff and I summarized the mappings and entailments of nearly 20 different causal metaphors, showing how several of them are employed within various sciences. A number of key philosophical points emerge from these analyses:
1. An adequate conceptual analysis (in this case, of causation concepts) must provide generalizations that explain the precise details of the semantics of the terms and must explain the inferences we make concerning those concepts. The details of the semantics and inference structure of each causal concept are provided by the submappings that jointly constitute the metaphor.
2. Almost all of the basic causation concepts we studied are metaphoric.
3 . There appears to be what we called a “literal skeleton” shared by all causation concepts, namely, that a cause is a determining factor in a situation. However, this bare skeleton is far too underspeciﬁed to generate any serious causal reasoning in the sciences. It is the metaphors that give rise to the relevant conceptual structure and that constrain the appropriate causal inferences.
4. Several of the main causation metaphors are mutually inconsistent. In other words, there are signiﬁcant metaphors that have incompatible ontologies. For example, in the location event-structure metaphor, states are (stationary)

44

MARK JOHNSON

locations, and the object or agent changes by moving to a particular (metaphorical) location. In contrast, in the object event-structure metaphor, a state is an object that moves, rather than being a stationary location. Consequently, these two metaphors cannot be reduced to a consistent literal concept. 5 . Causation is thus a massive radial category. At the center of the category is the closest thing to a literal conception – something like the application of physical force to an object that results in a change in its state or location. One example of this is what we call “billiardball causation.” Other less prototypical kinds of causation are metaphorically deﬁned.
If we take stock of the argument so far, the results are devastating for any literalist/objectivist philosophy. At least with respect to causation, there is no single literal concept of cause, nor are there even two or three basic literal concepts. There is no set of necessary and sufﬁcient conditions that deﬁne all causes. Instead, there are 20 or more metaphorical concepts used by ordinary people, scientists, and philosophers in their reasoning about causation. This conclusion does not undermine science at all. It only reminds us that different scientiﬁc approaches rely on different metaphorical concepts, which can be more or less appropriate in different situations and that dictate what counts as evidence and argument within a given science. What these analyses do undermine are objectivist philosophies that accept a classical theory of literal meaning, a classical objectivist metaphysics, and a classical correspondence theory of truth.
Moreover, it appears that what is true of our causal concepts holds for all of our most important abstract philosophical concepts. The current evidence for this is inductive, but it is very impressive. Many studies have now shown the metaphorical constitution of basic concepts in the sciences (Magnani & Nersessian, 2002), law (Winter, 2001), mathematics (Lakoff & Nu´ n˜ ez, 2000), ethics (Fesmire, 2003 ; Johnson, 1993 ), medicine

(Wright, 2007), politics (Lakoff, 1996), psychology (Fernandez-Duque & Johnson, 2002; Gibbs, 1994), music (Johnson & Larson, 2003 ), and many other ﬁelds. In light of this metaphorical constitution of our abstract concepts, we need to rethink what we are about as philosophers. There does not now exist, and probably never will exist, an exhaustive metaphorical analysis of the full range of philosophical concepts and arguments. That would be a daunting, unending task. However, a surprisingly large number of philosophical concepts have already been subjected to conceptual metaphor analysis over the past decade and a half. Here is a partial list of some of the more prominent concepts for which we have at least a preliminary metaphorical analysis:
Event, Cause, Action, State, Property, Purpose, Mind, Thought, Concepts, Reason, Emotions, Knowledge, Attention, Communication, Self, Will, Moral Rule, Rights, Justice, Duty, Good, Happiness, Society, Democracy, Love, Marriage, Being, Number, Set, Inﬁnity, Addition (Subtraction, Multiplication, etc.), the Cartesian Plane, and a host of other mathematical concepts.
The number of key concepts analyzed so far, and the depth of those analyses, strongly support the prospect that our abstract concepts are deﬁned by conceptual metaphor and metonymy. If this is so, then philosophical analysis is primarily metaphor analysis – working out the logic and inferential structure of the metaphors that ground our basic philosophical understanding of experience. Philosophical theories, like all theoretical constructions, are elaborations of conceptual metaphors. In a very strong sense, philosophy is metaphor.
Metaphor and Contemporary Philosophy of Language
The reality of conceptual metaphor and its central role in abstract conceptualization and reasoning calls into question large parts of traditional western views of meaning and truth, and it also challenges most of contemporary philosophy of language. If our

PHILOSOPHY’S DEBT TO METAPHOR

45

abstract concepts are metaphorically structured, then the classic objectivist/literalist view must be false. According to objectivist metaphysics and theory of knowledge, the world consists of objects, properties, and relations that exist in themselves, independent of human conceptual systems and human agency. Meaning is a matter of how our concepts map onto or pick out aspects of this mind-independent objective reality. Literal concepts are the direct connection between what we think (or what’s in our mind) and how the world is, and this connection (sometimes called “intentionality”) is the basis for the possibility of truth, which is taken to be a correspondence relation between propositions and states of affairs in the world. There cannot be any signiﬁcant role for metaphor in this picture of mind and world because the cognitive content of a metaphor would need to be reducible to some set of literal concepts or propositions, if it is to have any meaning and play a role in truth claims.
Quite obviously, if conceptual metaphor is essential for abstract thought, then the classic objectivist/literalist picture cannot be correct. Conceptual metaphor is a structure of human understanding, and the source domains of the metaphors come from our bodily, sensory-motor experience, which becomes the basis for abstract conceptualization and reasoning. From this perspective, truth is a matter of how our body-based understanding of a sentence ﬁts, or fails to ﬁt, our body-based understanding of a situation. And when we are thinking with abstract concepts, that understanding involves conceptual metaphor. There is a form of “correspondence” here – a ﬁtting of our understanding of a statement and our understanding of a situation. But this is not the classic correspondence of literal propositions to objective states of affairs in the world. Instead, the correspondence is mediated by embodied understanding of both the sentence and the situation.
In spite of the growing body of empirical research on conceptual metaphor that has emerged over the past two decades, contemporary analytic philosophy of language

has refused to recognize the existence of conceptual metaphor. This is not surprising, considering that to do so would undermine certain fundamental assumptions of analytic philosophy. I want to examine brieﬂy two of the most popular contemporary views of metaphor within analytic philosophy – that of John Searle and the view shared by Donald Davidson and Richard Rorty – in order to show why they cannot accept the reality of conceptual metaphor and how they are done in by its existence.
Searle (1979) approaches metaphor from a speech-act perspective, and he regards the activity of speaking a language as a highly conventionalized rule-governed form of behavior. Searle is also a literalist. He believes that the possibility of truth claims and a robust realism requires that all meaning be reducible to literal concepts and propositions that can, in the last analysis, correspond to states of affairs in the world. Various types of illocutionary speech acts would, according to Searle’s account, be rule-governed functions on these basic propositional contents. So, the problem of metaphor within Searle’s philosophy of language is to state the rules by which the literal sentence meaning (“S is P”) used for a metaphorical utterance can come to be interpreted by a hearer as a different literal utterance meaning (“S is R”) (Searle, 1979). On Searle’s view, the hearer must recognize that the speaker cannot be intending to convey the literal meaning of her utterance, must then calculate the possible alternate meanings she might possibly be intending, and must ﬁnally determine which is the most appropriate literal meaning in the present context.
The problem with this literalist/ objectivist version of the speech-act approach is that it simply cannot explain how metaphors actually work. Searle correctly sees that most metaphors are not based on an underlying set of literal similarities that might explain how P (in “S is P”) calls up R (in “S is R”) when we hear the metaphorical utterance. But Searle has no alternative speciﬁcation of the rules for cases that cannot be based on similarities.

46

MARK JOHNSON

He must surely recognize that his ﬁnal attempt to formulate a rule for certain types of metaphors is no explanation at all!
Things which are P are not R, nor are they like R things, nor are they believed to be R; nonetheless it is a fact about our sensibility, whether culturally or naturally determined, that we just do perceive a connection. (Searle, 1979, p. 108)
Saying that it just “is a fact about our sensibility” that we do make certain connections does not explain anything. When a literalist is forced to admit that certain metaphors are not based on any literal similarities between the source and target domains, then his literalism leaves him without resources to explain where the meaning comes from or how it is possible.
Conceptual metaphor theory solves this problem by rejecting literalism and by recognizing the pervasive structuring of our abstract concepts by metaphor. On this view, metaphors are based on experiential correlations and not on similarities. Joe Grady (1997) has analyzed the experiential grounding of a large number of what he calls “primary metaphors” that are sometimes combined into larger metaphor systems. Consider, for example, the primary metaphor Affection Is Warmth. Grady hypothesizes that this metaphor is based, not on similarities between warmth and affection, but rather on our experience, from infancy, of being held affectionately and feeling warmth. Multiple experiences of this sort in childhood would involve a neuronal co-activation of brain areas tied to the experience of bodily warmth and those tied to the subjective experience of affection and nurturance. This co-activation later becomes the basis for a primary metaphor, Affection Is Warmth. One of Searle’s well-known arguments against the similarity theory of metaphor is that there are no relevant literal similarities between a person named Sally and a block of ice that could explain the meaning of the metaphorical expression, “Sally is a block of ice.” Quite so, for this expression is not based on similarities. Rather, it is an

instance of the primary metaphor Affection Is Warmth, and so it is based on experiential correlations (of affection and warmth), rather than on similarities. If anything, the similarities are a result of the experienced correlation. However, Searle cannot accept this alternative theory because his literalism does not permit him to recognize that metaphoric source-to-target mappings could be equally as basic to our thought as are literal concepts. Searle’s theory is constrained by his traditional objectivist views of meaning, knowledge, and truth.
Another extremely popular view of metaphor is Donald Davidson’s deﬂationary rejection of metaphoric meaning. In his 1978 article, “What Metaphors Mean,” Davidson provocatively answers that they do not mean anything at all or at least nothing beyond the ordinary literal meaning of the utterance. In short, Davidson simply denies that metaphor is a semantic phenomenon, and he thus denies that metaphor has anything to do with making truth-claims: “We must give up the idea that a metaphor carries a message, that it has a content or meaning (except, of course, its literal meaning)” (Davidson, 1978, p. 45 ). Metaphor is only a pragmatic effect achieved by using a certain literal utterance to induce the hearer to notice something. Davidson says that a metaphorical utterance uses its literal meaning to “intimate” or “suggest” some nonpropositional insight: “Seeing as is not seeing that. Metaphor makes us see one thing as another by making some literal statement that inspires or prompts the insight.” (Davidson, 1978, p. 47).
Richard Rorty has become the ﬂamboyant spokesman for Davidson’s nonsemantic theory of metaphor. Seizing on Davidson’s claim that metaphor is not about propositional content or meaning of any kind, Rorty describes metaphors as linguistic ﬂares that catch and redirect the hearer’s attention:
Tossing a metaphor into a conversation is like suddenly breaking off the conversation long enough to make a face, or pulling a photograph out of your pocket and displaying it, or pointing at a feature of the surroundings, or slapping your interlocutor’s face, or kissing him. Tossing a metaphor

47

into a text is like using italics, or illustrations, or odd punctuation or formats. All these are ways of producing effects on your interlocutor or your reader but not ways of conveying a message. (Rorty, 1989, p. 18)
This view of metaphor as a nonsemantic use of language for certain attention-getting purposes has an important implication that Rorty is quick to note. The distinction between the “literal” and the “metaphorical” is seen, not as one “between two sorts of meaning, nor a distinction between two sorts of interpretation, but as a distinction between familiar and unfamiliar uses of noises and marks” (Rorty, 1989, p. 17). According to Rorty, these “unfamiliar” marks and noises somehow get us searching for new vocabularies in which they are no longer unfamiliar, but he has no account whatever of how this process is supposed to work.
The considerable popularity of both Searle’s and Davidson-Rorty’s view is easily understandable within the framework of analytic philosophy of language. As different as their two views may appear to be on the surface, they both share a set of grounding assumptions about meaning and truth that are foundational for analytic philosophy. In particular, they agree (1) that meaning is conceptual and propositional in nature, (2) that meaning is truth-conditional, and (3 ) that only literal concepts can be the bearers of meaning. Searle thinks that metaphors can have a semantic content of sorts, but he is at a loss as to how to explain that possibility, since he sees that they are not based on literal similarities and don’t seem to be literal propositions. Davidson and Rorty think that metaphors have no semantic content, are not propositional, and so cannot be bearers of truth.
Both theories are badly mistaken. Both theories ignore the growing body of empirical research on conceptual metaphor as a basic operation of abstract thinking. It should come as no surprise that neither Searle nor Davidson pays any serious attention to the work of cognitive linguists on the semantics of natural languages. If they did,

they would acknowledge the pervasive role of conceptual metaphor in abstract conceptualization and reasoning. How could Searle, or especially Davidson, explain our previous analysis of the semantics and inference structure of our metaphors for causation? Their literalist views have no resources whatever to explain the polysemy and inference generalizations that are explained in cognitive linguistics by the source-to-target mappings. Rorty sees quite clearly that his view has nothing whatsoever to say about the meaning and motivation for basic metaphors in science and philosophy:
For all we know, or should care, Aristotle’s metaphorical use of ousia, Saint Paul’s metaphorical use of agape´ , and Newton’s metaphorical use of gravitas, were the results of cosmic rays scrambling the ﬁne structure of some crucial neurons in their respective brains. Or, more plausibly, they were the result of some odd episodes in infancy – some obsessional kinks left in these brains by idiosyncratic traumata. It hardly matters how the trick was done. The results were marvelous. (Rorty, 1989, p. 17)
This is extremely clever, and beautifully expressed, but it is quite wrongheaded. For it does matter “how the trick was done.” It does matter where these metaphors come from – that is, why we have the ones we do, how they are grounded experientially, and how they shape our thought. Moreover, there are (at least partial) answers to such questions, answers provided by conceptual metaphor theory, that challenge the basic assumptions of contemporary analytic philosophy of language.
Rorty is probably right that we aren’t going to explain precisely why St. Paul came up with the metaphor for love that he did. But that does not mean that his metaphor was an irrational, unmotivated miracle, or a chance occurrence! Our inability to predict what novel metaphors will emerge does not entail the opposite extreme that metaphors just happen, irrationally. On the contrary, there is a great deal that we can say about what St. Paul’s metaphor means, about how it connects up with the other conceptual

48

MARK JOHNSON

metaphors for love that were common in his time (and in ours), and about how his metaphor extends or creatively blends aspects of these other metaphors. Conceptual metaphor theory can explain how this new metaphor could possibly make any sense to people and how they could draw inferences about its implications for how they should live their lives. Within cognitive linguistics, there already exist extensive analyses of the mappings for the key metaphors for love in our culture (Ko¨ vecses, 1988, 2000; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980). Nor did the Aristotlean conception of ousia spring fully armed from the head of Aristotle. Lakoff and Johnson (1999) have traced some of the main steps in the development of the metaphorical understanding of Being that begins with the pre-Socratic philosophers, blossoms in Plato, and is transformed in Aristotle. The idea of Being is a construction from various folk theories and conceptual metaphors concerning the nature of categories and entities in the world. Aristotle’s ousia is a remarkable achievement, but it is not a miracle.
If, like Davidson and Rorty, you don’t see that metaphor is a semantic phenomenon, then it should come as no surprise that, like them, you will regard metaphor merely as a nonrational rupture in a conceptual system (or, to use Rorty’s favorite term, a “vocabulary”) that inexplicably gives rise to a new way of talking. If you miss the experiential grounding of primary metaphors, you will, like Rorty, think that metaphor change is relatively arbitrary and not rationally motivated. Moreover, you will not recognize the crucial role of metaphor in shaping and constraining inference in ordinary mundane thinking, scientiﬁc research, and philosophical theorizing. In other words, Davidson and Rorty are literalists. Because they are oblivious to the pervasive workings of conceptual metaphor in shaping our conceptual systems, they cannot see that or how metaphor lies at the heart of human understanding and reasoning.
Philosophy as Metaphor
Virtually all of our abstract concepts appear to be structured by multiple, typically incon-

sistent conceptual metaphors. If this is true, then philosophical theories are not systems of foundational literal truths about reality but rather elaborations of particular complex intertwining sets of metaphors that support inferences and forms of reasoning. Humanizing and embodying philosophy in this manner does not devalue it in any way. On the contrary, it reveals why we have the philosophies we do, explains why and how they can make sense of our experience, and traces out their implications for our lives.
In Philosophy in the Flesh (1999), Lakoff and Johnson analyzed several philosophical orientations to reveal their underlying metaphors. That analysis included preSocratic metaphysics, Platonic and Aristotelian doctrines of Being, Cartesian views of mind and thought, and some of the founding assumptions of analytic philosophy of mind and language. As an example of how a metaphorical analysis of this kind might proceed, I want to consider Jerry Fodor’s “Language of Thought” metaphor for mind, since it has been so inﬂuential in recent philosophy of mind. Fodor wants to defend what he regards as a scientiﬁcally sophisticated version of the widespread folk theory that to have a mind is to have mental states (e.g., beliefs, wants, fears, hopes) that purport to be “about” aspects of our world. Thinking, as he sees it, must consist of chains of inner mental states that are somehow connected to each other (i.e., one thought leads to another) and that are also somehow connected to aspects of our experience (i.e., things in the world “cause” us to have these speciﬁc mental representations that we have). There are thus two major parts to Fodor’s theory: (1) how the mental states are related and (2) how those mental states are connected to the world (or how they are caused).
The ﬁrst part of his theory consists of the claim that these mental states form a “language of thought”: “A train of thoughts . . . is a causal sequence of tokenings of mental representations which express propositions that are the objects of the thoughts” (Fodor, 1987, p. 17). The language of thought is purely computational:

PHILOSOPHY’S DEBT TO METAPHOR

49

Mental states are relations between organisms and internal representations, and causally interrelated mental states succeed one another according to computational principles which apply formally to the representations. This is the sense in which internal representations provide the domains for such data processes as inform the mental life. It is, in short, of the essence of cognitive theories that they seek to interpret physical (causal) transformations as transformations of information, with the effect of exhibiting the rationality of mental processes. (Fodor, 1975 , p. 198)
Fodor’s language of thought (sometimes called “mentalese”), consists of symbols that in themselves are completely meaningless but that can be given meaning by the ways in which they are caused, or “tokened,” by certain events in the world. The mental representations in this language of thought are precisely like the arbitrary, meaningless symbols in computer programs. Within a computational program, operations are performed entirely on the formal (syntactic) features of the symbols, and Fodor believes that such features can “mimic” what we think of as semantic relations between our various mental representations:
Within certain famous limits, the semantic relation that holds between two symbols when the proposition expressed by the one is entailed by the proposition expressed by the other can be mimicked by syntactic relations in virtue of which one of the symbols is derivable from the other. (Fodor, 1987, p. 19)
The second key part of Fodor’s theory concerns the causal grounding of the internal representations. His claim is that these symbols are mental representations because they are caused by aspects of the world. Fodor summarizes this aspect of his theory:
I want a naturalized theory of meaning: a theory that articulates, in nonsemantic and nonintentional terms, sufﬁcient conditions for one bit of the world to be about (to express, represent, or be true of) another bit. (Fodor, 1987, p. 98)
Fodor and his followers believe that the language of thought hypothesis expresses

literal truths about the nature of mind, namely, that the mind is a computational functional program, that thinking is governed by syntactic rules, and that the meaningless symbols of mentalese are given meaning through their relation to aspects of our experience that cause them to be tokened in our minds. A large body of empirical research in the cognitive sciences shows why this view of mind cannot be correct, but that is not my focus here. Rather, my point is to show that Fodor’s entire model is composed of a series of interwoven complex metaphors that give rise to speciﬁc entailments about the nature of mind and the operations of thought.
Fodor’s key claim that all human thinking has the form of a language is an idea (a false idea) deeply rooted in our ordinary and philosophical ways of thinking. Because we so often express our thoughts in language, we are easily seduced into believing that human thinking has the form of a language. In other words, we presuppose the Thought As Language metaphor.

Our ordinary ways of thinking about the operations of mind and thought draw massively on our conception of written and spoken language. The idea that thoughts are linguistic forms written in the mind is the basis for expressions such as, “Let me make a mental note of that,” “She’s an open book to me – I can read her every thought,” “The public misread the President’s intentions,” and “Do you think I’m some kind of

mindreader?” Spoken language also provides a rich source domain for our conception of thinking as speaking, as in, “She doesn’t listen to her conscience,” “I hear what you mean,” “I can barely hear myself think,” and “That sounds like a good idea.” The Thought As Language metaphor covers all types of intellectual activity, as in, “Liberals and conservatives don’t speak the same language,” “He can’t translate his good ideas into practice,” “What is the vocabulary of basic philosophical ideas?” and “I wouldn’t read too much into what he’s saying.” Notice also that, according to this mapping, careful step-by-step thinking is conceived as careful spelling, as when we say, “Our theory of embodied meaning is spelled out in Chapter 3 ,” “Do I have to spell it out for you?” and “He always follows the letter of the law.”
Fodor’s language of thought metaphor makes intuitive sense to many people precisely because most of us assume that a purely formal language can be meaningful in the same way that a natural language is meaningful. That is, we assume the formal language metaphor.

Fodor correctly understands that a truly computational theory of mind requires that the language of thought be a formal language (akin to a computer language), and that a formal language cannot be modeled on a natural language. A “formal” language is an artiﬁcial language that, unlike natu-

ral languages, consists entirely of arbitrary meaningless symbols, each of which has speciﬁc formal (syntactic) features that play a role in formal operations speciﬁed for the language.
The key problem with this formal language metaphor is that actual formal languages do not and cannot possess the key features that make it possible for natural languages to be meaningful. Consequently, if Mind Is A Computational Program (i.e., the Mind As Computer metaphor), then the Language of Thought will not, in itself, be meaningful in any way. As a result, Fodor must ofﬁcially reject the formal language metaphor. But then he is left with the problem of how an intrinsically meaningless Language of Thought can somehow acquire meaning.
Fodor’s answer is that “tokenings” of particular mental symbols must become “representations” by being “caused” by objects and events that we experience. In other words, the “inner” mental symbols must be causally connected to things outside the mind. In his book Psychosemantics (1987), Fodor tries to develop a causal theory of how the symbols in mentalese can become meaningful, that is, how the symbols can come to be related to things “outside” the mind. Although I cannot argue this here, Fodor is ultimately unable to explain how there is a determinate connection between being in a certain situation and having certain speciﬁc symbols tokened in the mind. He cannot establish such relations for the reasons that Quine earlier articulated; namely, the “input” is always subject to multiple interpretations, so there is seldom or never a one-to-one correspondence between a mental symbol and an aspect of the “world.”
Philosophy’s Debt to Metaphor
My interest here is not to evaluate the adequacy of Fodor’s theory of mind and language. It is, rather, to show that his theory is based on a set of intertwined conceptual metaphors that operate, mostly unconsciously, in our culture. It is no criticism of a philosophical or scientiﬁc theory to show the underlying metaphors on which

PHILOSOPHY’S DEBT TO METAPHOR

51

it rests. Indeed, it is the metaphors that make it possible for the theories to make sense of our experience. All theories are based on metaphors because all our abstract concepts are metaphorically deﬁned. Understanding the constitutive metaphors allows you to grasp the logic and entailments of the theory. Thus, we will discover various common metaphors underpinning our philosophical theories, ranging from the pre-Socratics’ notions of Being and physis, to ideas about God in medieval theology, to Cartesian doctrines of mind, and up to 21st-century neurocomputational theories of cognition.
It would be impractical to try to survey the metaphorical foundations of all our philosophical theories. But it is a task that can and should be undertaken if we want to understand the inner workings of any particular theory in philosophy or science. This task will always include a metaphorical analysis of concepts such as cause, being, reality, and event but also of all aspects of mind and thought themselves, such as the grounding metaphors for concepts, reason, mind, thought, knowledge, logical relations, and values that lie at the heart of a speciﬁc theory. Even the theories of metaphor themselves must be analyzed. The theory of conceptual metaphor, for example, employs metaphors of “mapping” and “projection” to conceptualize the nature of metaphor itself. Such a conception could never be absolute – could never tell the whole story or cover all of the data – and so we must always be self-reﬂectively aware of our own metaphorical assumptions and their limitations.
I have argued that the single biggest reason that most traditional and contemporary philosophy cannot recognize the pervasive, theory-constituting role of metaphor in philosophy is the failure of philosophers to acknowledge the existence of deep systematic conceptual metaphor. They cannot recognize it because to do so would require a fairly substantial revision of some of the founding assumptions of their philosophies. It would require them to abandon some of their founding metaphorical conceptions in favor of other metaphors. If you acknowl-

edge conceptual metaphor, then you have to give up literalism. If you give up literalism, you must abandon objectivist theories of knowledge. If you reject objectivist metaphysics and epistemology, you must abandon the classical correspondence theory of truth. Eventually, you will have to rethink even your most basic conception of what cognition consists in.
The hold on us of objectivist and literalist views is so strong that we are sorely tempted to go to great lengths to salvage our traditional theories of mind, thought, and language. Searle ultimately falls back on a form of literalism. Davidson retains his literalism by denying that metaphors have meaning beyond their literal sense. Rorty doesn’t appear to be a literalist since he sees that metaphors are terribly important in the history of philosophy, but he has no theoretical resources to explain the phenomena as anything more than contingent, irrational, inexplicable random events.
In sharp contrast, once you understand how conceptual metaphors lie at the heart of our abstract conceptualization and reasoning, you acquire a new set of tools for analyzing, explaining, and criticizing philosophical theories. Philosophies are built out of conceptual metaphors. We need not be slaves operating blindly under the harsh inﬂuence of our metaphors. We can learn what our founding metaphors are and how they work. We can analyze the metaphors underlying other cultures and philosophical systems, too. Our ability to do this type of analysis is, admittedly, always itself shaped by metaphorical conceptions of which we are hardly ever aware. However, we can become aware of those metaphors, we can subject them to critical evaluation, and we can creatively elaborate them in developing new philosophies to help us deal with the problems that confront us in our daily lives.

of the denial of a serious cognitive role for metaphor. 2 The analysis of causal concepts that follows, along with their role in shaping philosophy, is adapted, with minor changes, from Lakoff and Johnson (1999), chapter 11, which is an extensive survey of the several metaphors that deﬁne our multiple concepts of events and causes.

CHAPTER 3
Rethinking Metaphor
Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner

1. Conceptual Mappings
The study of conceptual mappings, including metaphoric mappings, has produced great insights over the past several decades, not only for the study of language but also for the study of such subjects as scientiﬁc discovery, design, mathematical thinking, and computer interfaces. This tradition of inquiry is fulﬁlling its promises, with new ﬁndings and new applications all the time. Looking for conceptual mappings and their properties proves to be a rich method for discovery.1 To the initial studies that focused on cross-domain mappings and their most visible products have now been added many additional dimensions. Detailed studies have been carried out on topics such as compression, integration networks, and the principles and constraints that govern them.2
This blooming ﬁeld of research has as one consequence the rethinking of metaphor. We have a richer and deeper understanding of the processes underlying metaphor than we did previously. In this article, we will illustrate the central areas of theoretical advance by looking in some detail

at the often-studied metaphor of TIME AS SPACE. The points we shall emphasize are the following:
– Integration networks. Conceptual products are never the result of a single mapping. What we have come to call “conceptual metaphors,” like T I M E I S M O N E Y or T I M E I S S P A C E , turn out to be mental constructions involving many spaces and many mappings in elaborate integration networks constructed by means of overarching general principles. These integration networks are far richer than the bundles of pairwise bindings considered in recent theories of metaphor.
– Cobbling and sculpting. Such integration networks are never built entirely on the ﬂy nor are they preexisting conventional structures. Integration networks underlying thought and action are always a mix. On the one hand, cultures build networks over long periods of time that get transmitted over generations. Techniques for building particular networks are also transmitted. People are capable of innovating in any particular context.

GILLES FAUCONNIER AND MARK TURNER

The result is integration networks consisting of conventional parts, conventionally structured parts, and novel mappings and compressions. This very general point is illustrated in section 5 of our paper, with the passage “Emily’s diary.” – Compression. A remarkable conclusion of recent work which was overlooked by both early metaphor theory and early blending theory is that integration networks achieve systematic compressions. The ability to use standard techniques and patterns of compression and decompression enables us to work at once over elaborate integration networks. For example, a cause–effect relation connecting different mental spaces in the network may be compressed into a representation relation or an identity relation within the integration network. Wellknown examples often discussed in the blending literature include The Grim Reaper, Digging one’s own grave, Clinton and the Titanic.3 For T I M E A S S P A C E , watches, clocks, and other time-telling devices anchor timepiece blends with powerful built-in compressions. – Inference. Inference transfer is not in itself the driving force behind metaphor. In fact, it is typical for “source-domain” inferences to be violated in the emergent blended space. This is because topologies in the multiple inputs may clash, so that not everything will project to the blended spaces. – Emergent structure. The focus on single mapping and inference transfer in early metaphor theory left out many of the powers of integration networks, in particular the ability to develop emergent structure based on preexisting conceptual structures and to achieve compressions across them. In fact, as we shall see, the metaphorical mappings that seem most fundamental and observable, such as S P A C E → T I M E , can themselves be emergent in elaborate networks with successive blending. – Various species of conceptual integration. What were previously regarded as separate phenomena and even separate

mental operations – counterfactuals, framings, categorizations, metonymies, metaphors, and so on – are consequences of the same basic human ability for double-scope blending. More speciﬁcally, these phenomena are all the product of integration networks under the same general principles and overarching goals. They are separable neither in theory nor in practice: the majority of cases involve more than one kind of integration. The resulting products can belong simultaneously to any (or none) of the surface types “metaphors,” “counterfactuals,” “analogies,” “framings,” “categorizations,” or “metonymies.” The networks discussed below for the conception of time are a case in point. As shown below, they yield surface metaphors, counterfactuals, metonymies, and frames.
2 . Time Is Space, and Then Some
To illustrate how metaphor has been rethought within the broader perspective of integration networks and compression, we will revisit the classic metaphor of time as space and show in some detail that much of what is going on in this metaphor has gone unnoticed and therefore unexplained.4
Time as space is a deep metaphor for all human beings. It is common across cultures, psychologically real, productive, and profoundly entrenched in thought and language.
Once recognized, the mapping seems nonproblematic: the ordering of space is projected to the ordering of time, and inferences are obtained straightforwardly for the source domain and projected to the target domain. As established by metaphor theory, the new conceptualization of the domain of time is obtained through projection from space. For example, the fact that time is measurable and stable – inferences for which we do not have independent evidence – comes from the domain of space.5
But metaphors, this one included, involve more than mappings or bindings between two spaces. They involve many spaces, and

RETHINKING METAPHOR

55

they involve emergent structure in the network. The apparently unproblematic mapping by itself will not account for the complex emergent structure of the network and the data that express it.
To see this, let us start by looking informally at the full emergent structure that comes with this metaphor. Consider the following examples:
1. Three hours went by, and then he had dinner.
2. *Three feet went by, and he was at the door.
3 . Minutes are quick but hours are slow. 4. *Inches go by faster than feet. 5 . Those three hours went by slowly for
me, but the same three hours went by quickly for him. 6. For me, the hours were minutes, but for her, the minutes were hours. 7. At the end of the three hours, you will have solved the problem, but at the end of the same three hours, he will have solved it and ﬁve more. 8. Time came to a halt. 9. Sure, it’s Friday afternoon, but Monday morning is already staring us in the face. 10. Next week was an eternity away. 11. For me, the three hours were forever, but for her, they did not exist. 12. It’ll go by faster if you stop thinking about it. 13 . Our wedding was just yesterday. 14. Where have all those years disappeared? 15 . Next week was an eternity away. 16. I didn’t see those years go by.
Example 1 shows that we have not merely projected units of measurement onto time but also turned those units into moving objects. This does not come from projecting units of measurement onto time. In the domain of space, a unit of measurement is not a moving object. These are incompatible sorts of elements. But in the blend, we project onto a temporal experience both unit of measurement and moving object from the domain of space. Incompatible elements in the domain for space are thus fused to identity for time in the blend. The notion

of hours as simultaneously moving objects and units of measurement is emergent in the blended space.
Example 3 shows two things: that the emergent, moving temporal units have speed and that some have greater speed than others. But how could this be? The constituent parts of a moving object in space must all move at the same speed. Hours are composed of minutes. A straightforward “metaphoric” projection would require that minutes, hours, centuries, eons would all have the same speed. What has happened is that uncoupled objects that move at different speeds in space are projected onto constituent parts of a temporal interval in the blend.
There is a paradox in the standard metaphor analysis of time as space in having a source domain of moving objects that includes speed, since speed already seems to require time. This paradox is resolved in the standard analysis by assuming that motion is uniform, so that speed is irrelevant. But as we see, speed is relevant in the emergent conception of time. In fact, example 5 shows that not only can speed be different for different moving objects, but the same moving object can have different speeds. This is because we are also projecting to the temporal units in the blend our subjective experience of time and events. In our subjective, conscious experience, we have no reliable measure of time, but we do have strong feelings about the pace of events. In the blended structure, a “slow hour” is an hour to which we project our subjective experience of the events of that hour. That is why we can say, “For me, the hours were minutes, but for her, the minutes were hours.” Some exceptionally fast hours can have the speed of “normal” minutes. Some very slow minutes can have the speed of “normal” hours.
And it is not just as if units of time can go fast or slowly; they can also stop altogether, as in “Time came to a halt.”
And it’s not just as if units of time can have variable speed. They can also have variable existence, as in, “For me, the three hours were forever, but for her, they did not exist.”

In the topology of the domain of objects moving in space, all moving objects must be in different locations, and it is unusual (except, e.g., in the case of trains) that they follow the identical path. But in the blend for time, we are all in the same spot, and the very same times are moving past us on the same path.
In the topology of the domain of objects moving in space, the observers are typically at different locations, which is why they may experience the speed of the objects differently. But in the blend for time, all the observers are at the identical location. It is not their relative locations that account for the variation in perceived speed, but their attitudes toward the events that account for the variation in the speeds. The variation of speed for time is coming from the input mental space of felt experience, not from the domain of objects moving in space. The resulting emergent structure is actually incompatible with the physical space input.
In the topology of the domain of objects moving in space, distance is well ordered. Space is continuous and objects have permanence, and neither stretches of space nor objects in them vanish. But salience of times can be blended with temporal units to such an extent that, in the blend, salient times whose onset we fear can be closer and move faster. If Monday is all-important and we are anxious about what happens on Monday, we can say, “Monday is staring me in the face,” even if there are several days between now and Monday. In the blend, salient times whose onset we welcome can be farther away and move more slowly, as in, “It’s eons until my birthday,” or “My birthday never gets any closer.”
To summarize, the topology of the blend for time is incompatible with the domain of objects moving in space in many fundamental ways:
– In the domain of space, units of measurement are not moving objects. In the blend, they are.
– In the domain of space, observers are not at the same location and are not looking in the same direction. In the blend, they are.

Accordingly, in the blend, everyone sees the same moving objects (that is, sees the same temporal units). – In the domain of space, not all moving objects are on the same path. In the blend, they are. – In the domain of space, observers in the same location looking in the same direction would see not only the same moving objects but also the same speeds for those objects. But in the blend, observers are in the same location and looking in the same direction and seeing the same moving objects, but they perceive (in principle) different speeds for those objects. – In the domain of space, all the objects moving along a path exist, and the closer ones are perceived as closer. But in the blend, one more distant can seem closer, and some of the objects can be nonexistent. – In the domain of space, you cannot speed up or slow down the speed of the moving object by the quality of your attention. But in the blend, varying your attention can change the speed of the moving object.
These various linguistic examples and the emergent structures that make them possible derive from a systematic but elaborate integration network that involves a number of input spaces, blended spaces, vital relations, and compressions. We will go through the relevant input spaces and intermediate blends.
E: E is the input of Events. Human beings are expert at parsing the world into events (selling shoes, solving math problems, dining) and objects. Here we take as given that people can think of events and objects and refer to them. This expertise includes understanding event shape, including ordering and event type, and categorizing different events as belonging to the same type or to different types. Event spaces can include subjective experience of those events. Under this parsing, a lecture is an event with many participants – the lecturer, the audience, the support staff – and each participant

experiences the same event in a variety of different possible ways. So the lecture can be painful for me, pleasant for you, difﬁcult for the lecturer, easy for the technician, challenging for the interpreter.
X: An important kind of event for human beings is motion through physical space from point A to point B, with corresponding objective and subjective experiences. We call this subset of E the input of experienced motion through physical space. Within X, we have a number of existing correlations. If we travel from A to B and then B to C, we know that the event of traveling from A to B is over before the event of traveling from A to C is over. This comes from our ability to order events. So, all else being equal, relative length corresponds to ordering of events. AB is shorter than AC; the event <AB> is over before the event <AC>. In this space, the use of the notion of fast versus slow is not the one used in physics but correlates with the duration of events. So, in English, we say that going from A to B is “faster” than going from A to C, even if our speed in the technical sense is the same. In X, the event of traversing the path is connected with the path.
E/X: E and X are blended in routine ways to yield emergent structure. One consequence of this blending is to create the common notion that has sometimes been called the Event Structure Metaphor.6 According to this notion, we can “go through the lecture” just as we can “go through the park” because in the blend the event is motion from one point to another. In the blend E/X, any event has length and experienced motion (including speed, in the everyday sense of fast and slow rather than in the technical sense of physics). In E/X, the traveler of input X is fused with the experiencer of input E. The event in E is fused with the event of traversing the path in X and with the path in X. By this means, in the blend, an event becomes a path, and completing the event is traversing the path. As we can say that one stretch of road is faster than another because the event of traveling the ﬁrst is over before the event of traveling the other, just so, we can say that one event is faster

than another. E/X is a blend of a quite diffuse domain of events with a rather speciﬁc human-scale subcase of traversing a path, so that in the blend the perhaps diffuse event can be transformed to human scale. In fact, it seems from the data we have collected so far that however complicated our understanding of the domain of traversing paths (involving different terrain, vehicles, etc.), X takes into account only the lengths of the paths, so that for a given traveler, relative lengths of paths determines relative durations of traversal.
In the blended space, an event is an origin and a destination. Two travelers may begin at the same origin and arrive at the same destination; yet, they might traverse different paths, so the event can be long for one but short for the other and can be slow for one and fast for the other.
M: The socially (and technologically) constructed notion of time is then brought in independently as the blended domain M studied in The Way We Think (Fauconnier & Turner 2002). For starters, analogous days that we experience through observation – of, say, sun, stars, color variation, and so on – are compressed under blending into a single cyclic day (see Figure 3 .1).
This blended cyclic day, C, serves as one input to yet another blended space, M. The other input to M is a natural or technical dynamic mechanism with structure that gets partially and systematically mapped onto the cyclic day. To give one example of the mapping between the “mechanism” input space and the “cyclic day” input space, we map the situation in which both rotating rods on the face of a “clock” point to 12 in the “mechanism” space onto the sun’s being at its zenith in the cyclic day. In the blend, M, the cyclic day is integrated with the motion of the mechanism and we have additional shared events such as hours, minutes, seconds, years.

M is built on the basis of standard, normed, shared events such as “hands going around the clock.” It yields emergent structure of hours, minutes, seconds, years, . . . , which do not exist before the creation of these compressions to ideal events. These are now, in M, standard shared events. The culturally constructed domain, M, is thus a subset of the general domain of events, E, and some inputs to the blend M may have motion in space, for technological or natural reason (hands on the clock, sand in the hourglass, sun across the sky, . . .).
The crucial feature of these material timepieces is that they have, within tolerance, matching onset and termination for the same constructed events (minute, hour, day, . . .). How they operate between onset and termination is unimportant for the mapping, as is how they mark onset and termination, so long as onset and termination stay invariant across timepieces. If they match, then, for purposes of the M network, we can compress various timepieces to one ideal time-

piece because the particular onsets compress to the ideal onset and the particular terminations compress to the ideal termination. An analog clock works one way, with rods sweeping out circles past numbers, while a digital clock works another way, ﬂashing numbers on its screen, but we do not care: each indicates the onset and termination of the hour, and these indications are simultaneous when we set them side by side. The universal idealized timepiece deﬁnes universal events in which everything in the universe participates. The change from onset to termination deﬁnes, for example, an “hour.” We conceive of everything in the universe as going through that hour. How do we in practice relate to this idealized universal event? We relate to it because the compression guarantees that any local event involving motion of a tolerably accurate timepiece (watch, hourglass, sun) maps on consistently to the universal idealized event.
Notice that emergent in M we have universal events, but neither time nor measure.

RETHINKING METAPHOR

Since time is a measure of duration of events in general, M cannot give us time. It is instead a sophisticated system of emergent universal events. These universal events now have universal names – hour, minute, second.
E/X/M: Because M is a subset of E, it maps naturally onto E/X. This is the basis for an integration with inputs E/X on the one hand and M on the other, yielding the blended space E/X/M. In that blended space, universal events in M become particular local events in E/X. They are constrained to contain local events within their span, and any local event is contained in universal events projected from M. This gives any local event an additional dimension. Inescapably, you cannot go through the local event without going through the universal event that has the same beginning and end. In the emergent structure of the blended space, the universal event becomes a universal spatial length, and therefore a measure, analogous to yards, meters, and so on.7 This is why any event has a length – it is an hour long, a minute long, and so on. But, because of this containment, subjective experience of the local event is also for the experiencer experience of the projected universal event. So we can “go through an hour” just as we can go “through a lecture,” and the hour can be painful just as the lecture can be painful. Because subjective experience varies, and going through the lecture can be pleasant for you but painful for me, so now, in E/X/M, going through the hour can be pleasant for you but painful for me, or fast for you but slow for me because of the containment of the local event in the projected universal event. In M, the universal events are invariant. Their duration cannot vary, nor can they be painful or pleasant. But in E/X/M, those universal events become local events subjectively experienced, so they can vary according to the experience, not only for different experiencers but also for the same experiencer, depending on circumstances: “I went through the ﬁrst hour much more quickly than the second hour.” Mastery of the full network allows simultaneous access to objective length and subjective length. “It’s amazing how the eight-hour work day is longer on Monday than it is on Friday.” We

understand “the eight hours” as lying in M, where the duration is invariant but “longer” as lying in E/X/M, where it does vary; and so the statement is not self-contradictory.
Crucially, blending is not algorithmic, and there are two different conventional ways to blend E/X and M. M has events (rotating rods for the clock) that we are all, within signiﬁcant tolerance, supposed to agree about. Subjective experience does not differ for the special kinds of events in M, and that is the main reason that they are chosen to serve in M. But in general, duration can vary in E. There is a mapping between the events in E/X and the events in M, and when we blend them, we can preserve the topology of M or the topology of E/X. If we preserve the topology of M in the blended space E/X/M, then we are all agreeing about the duration of the events that are correlated with the universal events. So, you ask how long it took me to go through the lecture, and I say, “It went on too long; it was an hour and ﬁve minutes long.” I am using a compressed blend E/X/M in which M topology has been projected. But I can also use the topology of duration from E/X and then in the second conventional blend, the duration can vary, depending on subjective experience. I can say, “Centuries.” There is hyperbole being added, but now you know we are in the E/X/M blend dominated by the topology from E/X.
Hereafter, we will label the blend dominated by E topology E/X/M and the blend dominated by M topology E/X/M. The full network at this point contains two crucial blended spaces, E/X/M and E/X/M, with

60

GILLES FAUCONNIER AND MARK TURNER

different emergent notions of time. But conceptually, we have the ability to manipulate the full network with no contradiction, choosing to operate in one blend when we need subjective time and choosing to operate in the other when we need objective time. The rich conceptual notion of time as having both objective and subjective dimensions is emergent in the entire network. E/X/M has uniform durations for all experiencers: they are all on the same path because of the universal event with invariant durations. But in E/X/M blends, the separate experiencers can be on different paths, with different durations of traversal, as in, “Remember that visiting your parents goes faster for me than it does for you.”
The network we just described has many spaces, multiple projections, and hyperblends. Time in this network is not a primitive input but rather a notion that emerges from the full network. Once the entire network is achieved, it automatically contains as a by-product correspondences between time and physical space that previous analyses had to postulate: time and the time– space conceptual mapping are emergent in the network.
3. Duals
Metaphor theory recognizes that motion of an ego through time as space has a dual, namely, time as objects moving along a path past a stationary observer. This is a valid insight, but it, too, is a consequence of emergence in a full integration network that we will call the dual of E/X/M.
X has motion along a path. But motion is relative. Even though we know we are moving relative to the sun, it looks to us as if the sun is moving relative to us. When two trains are moving side-by-side, we can easily be in one and not know which one is moving. For any scene we inhabit, we can take ourselves as a point of reference, or something else as a point of reference. If we are in fact moving down the road, and take the tree as a point of reference, then we are going by the tree. But if we are in fact moving down the road and

take ourselves as the point of reference, then, relative to us, the tree is going by us. We will call the scene in which we take ourselves as the stationary point of reference “the relative motion scene.” In it, the tree is moving by us. We are not deluded by this framing. Relative motion is reﬂected straightforwardly in well-known examples such as
The old tollhouse went by. The rough stretch of road went by. The forest went by.
In relative motion, the path and all the things along it move, relative to you. X has its relative motion counterpart, call it X’. X’ is accurately described with expressions like:
That stretch of road went by effortlessly. The ﬁrst ﬁve miles went by effortlessly.
By projection, the blended space E/X has its relative motion counterpart, (E/X)’. In (E/X)’, path/events move relative to the experiencer, as in:
r The lecture went by effortlessly. r The party went by pleasantly.
By projection, the blended space E/X/M has its relative motion counterpart, (E/X/M)’. In (E/X/M)’, the event paths also move relative to the experiencer, as in:
The ﬁrst two hours went by effortlessly.

RETHINKING METAPHOR

61

In the relative motion counterparts, relative speed is preserved. If you moved slowly through an event, then in the relative motion counterpart, the event moves slowly by you.
As the E/X/M blended space can be dominated by the topology of E or M, giving us alternatively E/X/M or E/X/M, so (E/X/M)’ can be dominated by the topology of E or M, giving alternatively (E/X/M)’ or (E/X/M)’. In (E/X/M)’, all the universal events go by the same for all the experiencers. But in (E/X/M)’, they can go by differently for different experiencers or even for the same experiencer. So, with respect to (E/X/M)’:
– Friday always goes by faster than Monday. – The hours sped by for him but dragged
by for me. – It took centuries for the hour to pass. – Those three hours went by slowly for me,
but the same three hours went by quickly for him.
With respect to (E/X/M)’, we have expressions such as
– Minutes go by faster than hours. – The same hour will go by whether you
are suffering or having fun.
In (E/X/M)’, the same hour has the same durational properties for everyone, regardless of the events the hour contains. But in (E/X/M)’, the “same” hour can have different properties depending on the particular experiencer.
Subjective experience can vary quickly for a single experiencer, vary depending on the focus, and even toggle back and forth like a Necker cube, as in the following attested piece of data:
– “Time goes by really slowly. At the same time, it goes by really fast.” (CNN, said by a man waiting for word on an American named “Michael” missing in the bomb detonations in London in July 2005 .)
There are many ways to take this. In one, time is going by too slowly because Michael is not showing up, but time is going by too fast because the likelihood that Michael is dead increases with every passing minute.

Finally, it must be mentioned, although that is not the main focus of the present analysis, that the motion of events and times can be framed independently of an observer. This is especially true of universal times and planned events: Tuesday follows Monday. The lecture will be followed by a reception. Moore (2007) discusses such framing in detail. Nu´ n˜ ez et al. (2006) demonstrate its psychological reality.
4. More Networks
We have seen so far that analysis of metaphor requires analysis of elaborate integration networks producing what can seem like straightforward mappings between two domains taken as primitives. The ultimate conceptual correspondence between time (itself emergent) and physical space is real and especially visible, but it is a ﬁnal product of emergent structure in the elaborate integration network, not something to postulate as a basic primitive of human understanding.
Conceptual work is never-ending, and we can continue to bring more spaces and even networks into play with the elaborate integration network E/X/M. We can also use general conceptual techniques on that existing network.
One standard conceptual technique is to project agency into the occurrence of events, according to which, in the blend, the event is caused by the agent. In the blend with objective time (i.e., shared universal events, such as hours and minutes), all egos are constrained to move at the same rate. If we project agency to that causal constraint, all egos are moved through the shared universal events at the same rate by an agent, in this case often referred to as “Time,” or, historically, “the hour.” In this new blend, the emergent entity “Time” derives its motion from the network in which times move but derives its landmark from the network in which Ego moves. Importantly, this new agent is not a projection from the network of moving shared events (hours, etc.). It is not a particular hour that drives us along, but the movement of Time: “Time marches on,”

62

GILLES FAUCONNIER AND MARK TURNER

“Time waits for no man,” “Never fear: time will carry us along,” and, from Macbeth:
Come what come may Time and the hour runs through the
roughest day (Act one, scene three)
Provisioned with the blend in which Time the agent moves forward through objective universal events, we can make an additional blend in which Time moving through universal events is also moving through speciﬁc events that are scheduled for those universal events. To say that your tooth extraction was scheduled from 3 p.m. to 4 p.m. is to say that Time moved through a universal event (a particular hour) and the scheduled event simultaneously.
Additionally, we can construct the blend in which Ego moves not only through universal events (hours, etc.) but also actual events that correspond to the scheduled events in the schedule blend. Your actual tooth extraction corresponds to the scheduled tooth extraction, but might actually be a shorter or a longer or an interrupted event relative to the scheduled event. Actual and scheduled event need not coincide. Accordingly, Time may reach the end of the scheduled event before Ego reaches the end of the actual event. Moreover, Time may be closer to the end of the scheduled event than Ego is to the end of the actual event. In either case, Ego has fallen behind Time, when the comparison is between corresponding locations on the two paths. This makes other frames, such as racing, available, as in the examples from Chapter 1 of More Than Cool Reason (Lakoff & Turner 1989) such as “We are ahead of time” and “We are racing against time.” Expressions like “Time ﬂies” or “Time stands still” can also be construed with respect to this blend, if the scheduled or expected events differ from the actual ones.
Consider as an additional network that can come into play our independent integration network involving memory and physical space. In memory, events can be “close” or “distant,” “far apart,” “hard to access.” Relevant linguistic data indicating blends of

memory and physical distance include “Calling up things from the depths of your memory,” “Bringing a forgotten event to the surface.” These blends of memory and physical distance can be blended with the E/X/M networks, to produce items such as
– Our wedding was just yesterday. – Where have all those years disappeared? – The days of my youth are so close yet so
far away.
For purposes of terminology, we will refer to the blend of memory and physical space as R/S (for Recall/Space). When we blend E/X/M with R/S, we get a new integration E/X/M/R/S, which puts a metric on memory that uses the notion of time that is emergent in the E/X/M networks. The subjective feeling in R/S that the wedding is very accessible, very close, is mapped onto the subjective feeling about the events of yesterday. So the blend endows R/S with a metric using the notion of time. Accordingly, in the E/X/M/R/S blend, the word “yesterday” provides an adequate indication of distance in memory. So in E/X/M, our wedding was not yesterday (assuming it was 18 years ago). But the memory of the wedding as experienced in R projects to yesterday in E/X/M/R/S, where the wedding of 18 years ago can now be “yesterday.” In this case, the ordering topology of R/S dominates over the ordering topology in any version of E/X/M.
Now consider “Where have all those years disappeared?” Consider the reading in which this means that the speaker cannot remember the events over several years. The events in memory are gone, they map to corresponding years in E/X/M, and, accordingly, the years themselves are gone. But consider the alternative reading in which the speaker says, “My wedding was just yesterday. Where have all those years disappeared?” It is independently acknowledged that the objective distance of the wedding in E/X/M is 18 years. There is a clash between the conﬁguration in E/X/M and the conﬁguration in E/X/M/R/S. If the wedding was just yesterday in E/X/M/R/S (subjective memory with a time–space–motion structure), then

RETHINKING METAPHOR

63

there is no space for the 18 years that are right there in E/X/M (objective event reality with a time–space–motion structure), and those years must have disappeared. In this integration, subjective memory wins out over objective reality. Instead of objective reality’s indicating that your memory is faulty, memory shows that the years must be missing. If the reasoning is carried out in objective reality, then we have examples such as “My wedding seems like just yesterday. I must be losing it (on drugs, have Alzheimer’s).” In that case, objective reality wins over subjective memory. Examples such as “Where have all those years disappeared?” and others below show that when different mental spaces are built in which there are clashes, then reasoning can follow about that clash. Reasoning can be conducted in one or another of the mental spaces.
Take the variant, “My wedding seems like yesterday. The years have really gone by fast.” Again, the clash is between distance in subjective memory and objective reality. The reasoning is a very standard pattern imported from ordinary motion and speed in physical space. If the train departs city A and you are in city B before you know it, you can conclude either that B is close to A or that the train travels very fast. Then if you thought that A was close to B, and you are told that in reality it is far from B, you are forced to conclude that the train traveled fast. So in the same way, if your subjective memory tells you that your wedding and today are close, but reality informs you that they are in fact far apart, then you can resolve the clash by concluding that moving objects (here, times) have traveled fast.
But notice that variable speed of time is not a property within (E/X/M)’ (invariant universal time events) or within (E/X/M/R/S)’ (relative distance of events in memory). Variable speed of time is a property within (E/X/M)’, the subjective construction of time. The reasoning that years must have gone by fast resolves the clash between subjective memory and objective reality by inferring a greater speed in (E/X/M)’.

Time can ﬂy, race, drag, or come to a complete halt, as in “time stands still” or “time froze.” In all these cases, we need to be operating in more than one mental space, and there is some kind of clash between subjective experience and objective reality. For all of them, we can focus on (E/X/M)’ in order to resolve the clash. For example, if I think it is Saturday, and I realize that it is really Monday, then the clash is resolved in (E/X/M)’ by assuming that the days must have traveled fast, and I can say, “Time ﬂies.”
Other domains are covertly involved in such networks. Expectations are run parallel to experience, and they can clash for all kinds of reasons. An extreme case is when we say, “Time has frozen” or “come to a halt.” We expected or desired events to be taking place, but their onset has not occurred. In (E/X/M)’, times and events are blended and move together. Events not happening is the same as events not moving, and accordingly subjective time is not moving. The feeling can have many different causes. Suppose we are watching a play whose script we know well. At one point, an actor fails to deliver his line, either because he has forgotten or tripped and needs to regain balance. Of course, events are going on, but not the expected events, and the expected events will take place, just not when we expected them. The delay between expectation and reality can be solved by recruiting from (E/X/M)’ a variable speed for time of zero. “Time froze while he tried to remember his line.”
5. Cobbling and Sculpting
Nathaniel Smith notes the following passage in a novel:
Remarkable – when I am sitting on a cushion on the ﬂoor, busy with
scissors and glue pot, the time just vanishes. Before I know it the
latticed rectangle of pale autumn sunlight has moved from the left
wall across the ﬂoor to the other wall and Mrs. O’Carolan is calling

64

GILLES FAUCONNIER AND MARK TURNER

me for supper. Perhaps time is ﬂowing faster up there in the attic.
Perhaps the accumulated mass of the past gathered there is pulling
time out of the future faster, like a weight on a line. Or perhaps,
more mundanely, it is only that I am getting older every year and that
it is the accumulated weight of time behind me that is unreeling the
years with ever-increasing speed. What a horrible thing it must be to
grow older and ﬁnd that ever-decreasing number of years hurrying you
faster, faster toward your grave, as if time were impatient to be rid
of you. (Ian McDonald, “Emily’s Diary, November 5 , 1913 ,” in King of Morning, Queen of Day, pp. 82–83 .)
Although this may seem fanciful, it is easily understood exactly because it is exploiting the network for time that we have discussed. A phrase such as “time just vanishes” is standard and idiomatic, and, as we saw, a result of resolving a clash between subjective experience and shared universal events. The pale autumn sunlight’s moving across the room is a local timepiece that can be put into registration with other timepieces. As in the general case, subjective feelings of duration are blended with speed of motion. But now, the question arises, why would time be operating this way? The answer, again a standard derivative of the standard network, is that time has a variable speed, and now a new blend is constructed according to which that motion is induced by standard physics. Weight is pulling the timeline along. Interestingly, this still preserves the registration of the timepieces. Even though the subjective speed of time when you are doing certain things in the attic is much greater than the subjective speed of time in the kitchen, the time in the attic will match the time in the kitchen whenever you go to the bother of checking because that is a property of E/X/M. This network allows us to get to a point with different speeds at different spots in the network, but the points will match

with M. The additional blending of “pulling time” is simply opportunistically exploiting a connection between objects and weight and the fact that if you have more objects, you have more weight. The mass in the past is picking out events in the subjective space. This subjective space is much fuller of events from the past when you are in the attic, among all those souvenirs, than it is in the kitchen, where you are engaged in cooking sausage to eat immediately. So when you go down to the kitchen, your subjective space changes, and the weight of the past diminishes with each step as you go down, so by the time you get to the kitchen, time is running at its usual pace, no longer being pulled precipitously along.
The variant of years being pulled faster for older people because of the greater time behind them is another way of resolving the clash by blending the subjective space in (E/X/M)’ with a concrete frame of the pull of gravity. In the new blend, the “time objects” are linked and the increasing weight of those behind pulls the present and future ones ever faster. It exploits the fact that in (E/X/M)’, we know that the objects move differently for different experiencers.
Spectacularly, in fact, in the last variant, it follows that a small number of years is now moving ever faster past you. In the relative motion dual of this scene, you are therefore moving faster toward the end, the grave. At this point, there is a blend with intentionality. How does this feel? Now subjective experience is restructured again to include desire for the speed on the part of time, and the cause of Time’s increasing the speed is its impatience to get rid of you, that is, to bring you to your end.
Conclusion
Metaphoric mappings, theory of metaphor, and metaphor analysis need to be revised to include permanent features of cognition:
– Integration networks – Cobbling and sculpting – Emergent structure

of inference.
We have shown in some detail, with TIME AS SPACE, how to go about this revised and deeper form of metaphorical analysis, taking into account the aforementioned properties of cognition. As far as we can tell, the considerations we adduced apply quite generally to any metaphorical analysis. The message for all of us metaphor theorists is that we need to go far beyond the usual focus on crossdomain mapping and inference transfer. We need to face squarely the far greater complexity of integrations that lie behind observable metaphorical conceptual systems. We need to take into account their cultural history, and we need to account explicitly for the emergent structures they produce, both over cultural time and over individual time (a child’s learning of the elaborate interconnected integration networks). In the early days of contemporary linguistics, the realization that children mastered stunningly complex syntactic and phonological structures was often met with disbelief: how could toddlers possibly know so much? We know better today: the child’s cognitive brain leaves in the dust our most powerful computers. So there is nothing surprising in the discovery that meaning construction is also supported

and effected by highly elaborate dynamic systems. The challenge for the analyst is to delve rigorously into these remarkable constructions of the mind.
The permanent features of cognition that we have drawn attention to in the present work are part of metaphor because metaphor itself is one particularly important and salient manifestation of conceptual integration. Double-scope integration, which typically exploits clashes, is the hallmark of cognitively modern human beings. And metaphor is one of its most powerful products, one that often drives key aspects of art, science, religion, and technology.

This is coincidence of local events. To say that something is a meter long is to fuse the local with the universal. In the space of physical space, before you had the universal yardstick, let’s say, all you could do is compare: this is longer than that. Once you have a universal yardstick, now everything has a length. There is now a universal stuff (of course, this is an emergent concept) just as there are universal events. The meter is made out of universal stuff conceptually, just as the hour is a universal event. Get rid of 5 pounds, take 10 minutes out of your lecture, how many square feet in your house? etc.

CHAPTER 4
How Metaphors Create Categories – Quickly
Sam Glucksberg

“I ﬁnd people confusing . . . [because they] . . . often talk using metaphor, such as he was the apple of her eye, we had a real pig of a day, they had a skeleton in the cupboard. I think it [metaphor] should be called a lie because a pig is not a day and people do not have skeletons in their cupboards and . . . imagining an apple in someone’s eye doesn’t have anything to do with liking someone a lot . . .” (Haddon, 2003 , p. 15 ). So claims Christopher Boone, the protagonist in Haddon’s perceptive and riotously funny novel about an autistic teenager trying to ﬁgure out the world around him.
Like metaphor theorists from Aristotle to contemporary philosophical, linguistic, and psycholinguistic writers (cf. Bowdle & Gentner, 2005 ; Fogelin, 1988; Searle, 1979), metaphors such as Sam is a pig are considered to be false categorical assertions, and so must be treated as similes (e.g., Sam is like a pig) in order to be understood. A preference for simile over metaphor is clearly endorsed by our autistic savant Christopher, who, referring to a neighbor whom he dislikes intensely, observes, “He had a very hairy nose. It looked like there were two very

small mice hiding in his nostrils. This is not a metaphor, it is a simile, which means that it really did look like there were two very small mice hiding in his nostrils. And a simile is not a lie, unless it is a bad simile” (Haddon, 2003 p. 17).
In these few lines, Christopher Boone neatly captures the traditional pragmatic view of metaphor comprehension. Nominal metaphors such as my lawyer is a shark or my surgeon was a butcher are taken to be literally false. Literally false assertions are considered to be infelicitous because they violate one of Grice’s (1975 ) conversational maxims, namely, to be truthful. As such, they are defective if taken literally because they do not make sense in the context of the utterance. Therefore, a hearer or reader must search for a nonliteral meaning that does make sense. Understanding nonliteral meanings thus requires three distinct processing stages:
1. Derive the literal meaning of the utterance.
2. Assess the interpretability of that meaning in the utterance context.

3 . If the literal meaning does not make sense in context, then search for a nonliteral meaning that does.
As Searle (1979) put it, “Where an utterance is defective if taken literally, look for an utterance meaning that differs from sentence meaning” (p. 114). Applying this general model to how people understand nominal metaphors, we have the comparison model of metaphor comprehension. Nominal metaphors such as some roads are snakes or my job is a jail are “defective” in that they are literally false. One way to deal with this problem would be to convert a literally false categorical assertion into a true comparison assertion, that is, a simile. Similes are always literally true because any two things must always be alike in one way or another, indeed, in an indeterminate number of ways. This move produces the standard pragmatic model of metaphor comprehension. According to this model, metaphors are considered to be implicit similes. When a statement of the form X is a Y is literally false, then it is converted into a true simile, X is like a Y, and then treated exactly as any literal comparison (see Gentner, 1983 ).
This general comparison view has three important, testable psychological implications. First, literal meanings have unconditional processing priority. Literal meanings are always computed ﬁrst and are computed unconditionally. Nonliteral meanings are never computed until literal meanings are computed and found to be “defective” – they do not make sense in context. Literally intended language should thus be easier to understand and should also take less time to compute than nonliterally intended language. In addition, nonliteral meaning computation is optional: nonliteral meanings are sought only if the literal meaning is uninterpretable. Thus, unless literal meanings won’t work, nonliteral meanings are ignored.
A second implication of this view is that comparisons are easy to understand, whether they are literal or metaphorical. But, how do people solve the comparison problem? Since any two things can be alike in innumerable ways, how do we iden-

tify precisely those ways that are intended? Consider the old adage about inappropriate comparisons: they are characterized as comparing apples and oranges, reﬂecting a belief that one can’t (or at least shouldn’t) compare apples and oranges. A moment’s reﬂection reveals that apples and oranges can indeed be compared and that they share many, many properties: both are edible, have a warm color, round shape, similar in size, contain seeds, grow on trees, good for making juice, names begin with a vowel, and they are unsuitable as balls in such games as tennis, ﬁeld hockey, or baseball. Clearly, solving the comparison problem requires more than an exhaustive search for shared features or properties. Substituting a simile for a metaphor obviously doesn’t automatically solve the comprehension problem.
A third implication of the comparison view is that metaphors and similes are, to all intents and purposes, interchangeable. Metaphoric assertions can be put in either of the two forms, X is a Y or X is like a Y. Are these two forms used to express the same meanings, or can their meanings differ systematically?
These three implications have been empirically tested, and all three turn out to be false. Instead, the following three generalizations characterize metaphor comprehension:
1. Literal meanings do not have unconditional priority, and so they are not necessarily easier to compute than nonliteral meanings. More importantly, metaphor comprehension is not optional; it does not depend on the defectiveness of literal meanings. Instead, metaphor comprehension is mandatory, that is, automatic. Whether or not a literal meaning makes sense in context, potential metaphorical meanings cannot be ignored.
2. Metaphors are rarely understood via comparison. Instead, they are usually understood exactly as they appear, as class-inclusion assertions. When someone says that their surgeon was a butcher, that is what they intend: that

HOW METAPHORS CREATE CATEGORIES – QUICKLY

69

their surgeon belongs to a category of persons who are butchers in one way or another. 3 . Metaphors and similes are not interchangeable. These two forms express different meanings, sometimes subtly different, sometimes signiﬁcantly so. Furthermore, the differences between similes and their corresponding metaphors are systematic and can be accounted for in a principled, theoretically coherent way.
The central idea is that metaphors are categorical, class-inclusion assertions. For conventional metaphors, the category preexists; it had been established when the metaphor was ﬁrst coined. For novel metaphors, a category is created and the metaphor vehicle serves as the name of that category.1 We will examine these ideas in detail. We turn now to the ﬁrst issue: are literal meanings privileged vis-a`-vis metaphorical ones?
Priority of the Literal
The priority of the literal takes two forms: relative ease of processing and unconditional temporal-order priority. With respect to relative ease of processing, the longstanding assumption that literally intended utterances are understood more easily than those intended nonliterally can be easily rejected. At one extreme, familiar idioms are no more difﬁcult to understand than their literal counterparts. Indeed, the idiomatic meanings of expressions such as “kick the bucket” are understood more rapidly than their literal meanings (to die versus strike a pail with one’s foot (Gibbs, Nayak, & Cutting, 1989; see also Giora, 2003 , on the issue of graded salience). This is not at all surprising, given that such expressions can be stored in a phrasal lexicon along with other familiar expressions such as cliche´ s, song titles, lines of poetry, and the like (see Jackendoff, 1995 ). Understanding familiar idioms may thus be very much like understanding individual lexical items, via direct access. More surprising, perhaps, is

that even novel metaphors can be understood as rapidly as comparable literal expressions, provided that the novel metaphors are apt (Blasko & Connine, 1993 ). It seems that given a linguistic input, literal and ﬁgurative meanings, where available, are computed in parallel, even in the absence of contextual supports (McElree & Nordlie, 1999). Consistent with these behavioral studies, studies using brain-recording (e.g., event-related potential patterns) and brain-imaging techniques (e.g., fMRI) ﬁnd little evidence for differences in brain area activation patterns for literal versus metaphoric language processing (Ahrens, 2004; Pynte et al., 1996; Rapp et al., 2007; but see Stringaris et al., 2 0 0 7 ).
If literal and ﬁgurative meanings are computed in parallel and engage the same brain areas for processing, then the second literalpriority assumption – that nonliteral meaning computation is optional – is also suspect. We know that people cannot refuse to understand literal language. Instead, understanding “occurs automatically without conscious control by the listener . . . loss of control over one’s language comprehension device may correspond to knowing a language ﬂuently” (Miller & Johnson-Laird, 1976, p. 166). Linguistic input automatically triggers semantic and syntactic analyses that generate literal sentence meaning (Fodor, 1983 ). Could those processes and analyses that generate metaphorical meanings also be automatically triggered by linguistic input?
Just as people cannot ignore literal meanings, people cannot ignore metaphorical meanings. A classic demonstration of the automaticity of literal language processing was provided by Stroop (193 5 ), via the eponymous Stroop interference effect. Stroop had people attend to individual color words such as red, yellow, or green. These words were printed in various colors, and Stroop instructed his participants to ignore the words themselves, but instead to name the color of the ink that the words were printed in. When ink color and color name matched, people could respond quickly and accurately. When, however, they mismatched, as when the word “red” was

70

SAM GLUCKSBERG

printed in green ink, the response of saying “green” was signiﬁcantly delayed. What has come to be known as Stroop interference demonstrated that ﬂuent readers could not ignore word meanings.
A version of Stroop’s paradigm provides an analogous demonstration that people cannot ignore metaphorical meanings. Glucksberg, Gildea, and Bookin (1982) asked people to read sentences and to judge whether they were literally true or false. Most of the sentences were nonproblematic: they were clearly either true or false; for example, “some birds are robins” is unambiguously true, “some birds are tables” is unambiguously false. However, a sentence such as “some birds are ﬂutes,” while literally false, has some metaphorical truth to it. Just as the word “red” printed in green ink produces response conﬂict, a literally false sentence that is metaphorically “true” should also produce response conﬂict if, indeed, people cannot ignore metaphors. And that is exactly what happened. People fell prey to the classic Stroop interference with literally false but metaphorically true sentences: they took signiﬁcantly longer to correctly respond “false” to these kinds of sentences than to unambiguously false literal sentences (for replications and extensions of these results, see Blasko, 2004; Gildea, & Glucksberg, 1983 ; Keysar, 1989).
The priority of the literal also fails when people interpret noun–noun combinations such as shark lawyer or steel arms. Each of these phrases can be interpreted either literally or metaphorically. For example, shark lawyer can refer to a lawyer who represents an environmental group dedicated to protecting rare species of sharks from extinction or to a lawyer who is predatory and aggressive, as in “my lawyer is a shark.” Similarly, steel arms can refer to arms that are made of steel (as in a machine of some sort or a robot) or to human arms that are strong (metaphorically, arms as strong and hard as steel). In neither of these two cases are literal meanings in any way “defective,” and so if literal meanings do have priority, then they should be the preferred interpretations. However, if metaphorical meanings are generated as automatically as literal ones, then we would

expect people to opt for metaphorical meanings at least as often as literal ones. Goldvarg and Glucksberg (1998) gave people two types of noun–noun combinations: those that could only be paraphrased literally, and those that could be paraphrased both literally and metaphorically. For the literalonly items, 82% of the interpretations were unambiguously literal. In contrast, for the items that could be paraphrased either literally or metaphorically, 75 % of the interpretations were metaphorical. The overwhelming preference for metaphorical interpretation, even when the literal is perfectly acceptable, is clearly inconsistent with the assumption of literal priority. Even when metaphors are in the implicit form of a noun–noun combination, metaphorical meanings cannot be ignored.
Conclusions on the Priority of the Literal
a. Speed of processing: metaphorical and literal meanings are processed equally quickly.2
b. Temporal priority: metaphorical and literal meanings are processed in parallel, with neither having unconditional priority.
c. Automaticity: Neither literal nor metaphorical meanings can be ignored. When either is available, then they are processed. In some circumstances, when both are available, metaphorical meanings may be preferred to literal (in Giora’s terms [2003 ], they may be more salient than the literal).
Understanding Metaphors: A Comparison Process?
Understanding Comparisons
People can understand literal comparisons in at least two ways. One way would be via feature matching. The properties of the two terms of a comparison are extracted and are then matched with one another. Those properties that are in common to the two, as well as those that are not in common, are then used to establish the ground for the comparison, as well as the degree of similarity

HOW METAPHORS CREATE CATEGORIES – QUICKLY

71

of the two concepts (cf. Gentner & Markman, 1994; Tversky, 1977). An alternative strategy can be used instead of property extraction and matching. Instead of matching the properties of the two concepts, one can identify the closest superordinate category that encompasses the two concepts and then use that category’s properties as the ground for the comparison. This latter strategy is the one used in the similarities subscale of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale (Wechsler, 195 8). The similarities subscale contains items such as “How are oranges and lemons alike?” The correct answer, provided in the test manual, is “both are citrus fruits.” This category’s properties constitute the ways in which oranges and lemons are alike: they have the same kind of skin, seeds, acidic juice, and so on. The items increase in difﬁculty as the superordinate category becomes increasingly abstract, for example, “How are oranges and insects alike?” One answer: both are organic.
These two approaches to understanding literal comparisons are also applicable to understanding metaphoric comparisons, or similes. For example, one can try to understand how lawyers and sharks are alike by matching the properties of lawyers and of sharks, as proposed by comparison theorists such as Gentner and her colleagues (e.g., Gentner & Wolff, 1997). Alternatively, one can use the categorical approach and seek the closest category that encompasses the two concepts, lawyer and shark. One answer to the question of how lawyers and sharks are alike is both are “sharks.” In what sense can such a category be identiﬁed as “Sharks”?

and merciless (see Figure 4.1a). How shall we call that category? One viable option is to use the name of a stereotypical member of the category of predators as the name of the category itself, namely, “Shark.” The metaphor vehicle, “Shark,” refers to a type, or category of thing. In contrast, when it is used literally, it refers to one member of that category, the marine animal “shark.”
In this way, the term “shark” has dual reference. When used in metaphor form, it refers to the category of predators that we can call “Sharks.” When used in simile form, it refers to the literal shark. As Roger Brown put it some years ago, “Metaphor differs from other superordinate-subordinate relations in that the superordinate is not given a name of its own. Instead, the name of one subordinate (i.e., the metaphor vehicle) is extended to the other” (Brown, 195 8, p. 140). Thus, in expressions such as My job is a jail, the term “jail” refers to a category of unpleasant, conﬁning, difﬁcult to get out of, punishing situations that the literal jail exempliﬁes. Both my job and jail now belong to the metaphorical category “Jails.”
Dual reference is not an exotic linguistic strategy that is exclusive to ﬁgurative language. Instead, it is a common,

Understanding Metaphors: Dual Reference
Just as any two concepts or objects can be alike in innumerable ways, so can any two concepts or objects belong to innumerable different categories. Consider three objects: Tuna, Shark, and My lawyer. Tuna and Shark are both ﬁsh, and they are also both foods. Neither of these categories seem applicable to “my lawyer,” but sharks and lawyers can both belong to the category of predators, that is, creatures that are vicious, aggressive,

everyday referring strategy whenever a language community lacks a name for a superordinate category, yet needs a referring expression for that category. For example, this strategy is exploited by speakers of classiﬁer languages, languages that generally do not have names for superordinate categories. Some of the Native American languages of southwest United States are classiﬁer languages and employ this strategy. In Hopi, for example, the most typical tree is the cottonwood, and so the name for the cottonwood tree is used to refer to trees in general (Trager, 193 6–193 9). When speakers wish to distinguish between cottonwood and other kinds of trees, they use real-cottonwood for that speciﬁc tree and cottonwood for the others. Similarly, Shoshoni speakers use eagle for all large birds of prey (Hage & Miller, 1976) unless they wish to distinguish between eagles and other large birds, in which case they use real-eagle for that speciﬁc bird.
In languages that generally have lexical items for superordinate categories, the same dual reference strategy can be used when a novel category is created but has yet to be named. Indeed, the use of a dual-referring expression may well create that category, as when we ﬁrst use a term for a speciﬁc referent to refer generically to the category that the referent exempliﬁes. Examples abound: Kleenex for facial tissues in general, Xerox for dry-paper copying machines, Jell-O for gelatin desserts, and Jeep for all-purpose four-wheel drive vehicles (derived originally from the military term General Purpose, or GP, vehicle). In some cases, nouns used in this way can also be used as verbs, as in Xeroxing documents, or, in England, Hoovering to refer to the act of vacuuming with, of course, a Hoover vacuum cleaner.
Metaphoric categories can be named and created in precisely this way. It took less than a journalist’s day for the term “Enron” to be used to refer to a newly created category, the set of stunningly scandalous corporate accounting schemes that fraudulently enrich upper-echelon management while incurring stockholder and employee losses of unprecedented magnitude. Is it any wonder

that people latched on to a single term, “Enron,” to simultaneously create and name that category, as in, “who will be the next Enron”? In most cases, the dual reference of such terms as “Kleenex” or “Enron” goes unnoticed, so natural is this discourse strategy. In some expressions, however, the dual reference function is transparent, as in “boys will be boys,” where the ﬁrst use of the word “boys” refers literally to young human males and the second to the category young human males who behave in boisterous and often offensive ways. Similarly, when Cambodia misguidedly invaded Vietnam several decades ago, the disastrous military venture was referred to as “Cambodia has become Vietnam’s Vietnam.” Here, the ﬁrst mention of Vietnam referred, metonymically, to that country’s government and military, while the second referred to the category of disastrous military ventures that Vietnam had come to symbolize to America and the rest of the world. Exactly this strategy was used when a civil-rights lawyer expressed concern for the Florida voting process in the 2004 presidential election. Voting records had disappeared after computer systems crashed after a primary election in Miami-Dade County, where votes had been disputed in the 2000 presidential election. Said the chair of the Miami-Dade Election Reform Coalition, “This shows that unless we do something now – Florida is headed toward being the next Florida” (Goodnough, 2 0 0 4 ).
We can now understand what I like to call the paradox of unlike things compared. Literal comparison assertions compare two “like” things: two things that belong to the same taxonomic category, as in coffee is like tea. Such comparisons cannot be paraphrased as categorical assertions because they are inevitably false: to say that coffee IS tea doesn’t make much sense (unless intended metaphorically!). In contrast, metaphoric comparisons – that is, similes – can usually be so paraphrased. Consider the simile my lawyer is like a shark. This assertion compares two “unlike” things, that is, two things from widely disparate categories, professional people and ﬁsh.

Figure 4.2 . Hypothetical vehicle properties.

Nevertheless, it can be paraphrased as a categorical assertion, my lawyer IS a shark.3
The property of similes and their corresponding metaphors that makes such paraphrases acceptable is the dual reference function of the metaphor vehicle. In the lawyer–shark example, the term “shark” refers at two different levels of abstraction, in the simile versus the metaphorical. In the simile, the term “shark” refers at a basic level of abstraction, the ﬁsh that lurks beneath the ocean waves. This is the literal shark, with properties such as vicious, predatory, and aggressive but also having ﬁns, gills, and leathery skin (see Figure 4.2). In the metaphor, the term “shark” refers at a higher level of abstraction, the category of creatures that the literal shark exempliﬁes. Among the properties of this category are vicious, predatory, and aggressive but not properties of literal sharks such as having ﬁns, gills, or leathery skin.4

Implications of Dual Reference for Understanding Metaphors and Similes
Because the metaphor vehicle and the predicate of the simile refer to different entities – the categorical and the speciﬁc basic-level concept, respectively – both the process and product of comprehending the two forms should differ systematically. Three phenomena reﬂect the differences between understanding metaphors and understanding their corresponding similes:

1. Relative ease of understanding the two forms.
2. Effects of highlighting the literal versus metaphorical referents of the metaphor vehicle.
3 . Systematic differences in how the two forms are interpreted.5
Ease of understanding. In similes, the predicate of the comparison refers directly to the literal exemplar of the metaphorical category, e.g., the ﬁsh “shark” as an exemplar of the metaphorical category of “sharks.” For familiar metaphors and similes, there should be little if any difference in comprehension time because the work of sorting out the relevant from the irrelevant properties of the simile’s predicate has already been done. Presumably, metaphor-irrelevant properties of sharks, such as having gills and leathery skin, can be swiftly rejected when we encounter similes such as “my lawyer was like a shark.” However, for relatively unfamiliar similes and metaphors, similes should require more interpretative work because they would tend to evoke both metaphorrelevant and metaphor-irrelevant – that is literal – properties. In contrast, metaphors, because they refer directly at the categorical level, should evoke only properties of the category, not those of a category’s literal exemplars. This argument applies, of course only to apt metaphors, metaphors that employ an easily recognizable prototypical exemplar of a candidate metaphorical category. Metaphors such as “Enron” and “Florida” in appropriate contexts typify such categories. Others clearly do not. For example, their love was a ﬁling cabinet would not be easily and categorically understood because ﬁling cabinets do not exemplify any readily recognizable metaphoric categories. In such cases, people might well need to resort to a comparison strategy, considering properties of ﬁling cabinets that might plausibly apply to romantic relationships. And people often succeed, but only with effort, in this case coming up with candidate properties of ﬁling cabinets such as holds memories, cold and routine, and cluttered and old.

SAM GLUCKSBERG

For more apt metaphors, the data are sparse, but support the processing advantage of metaphors over similes. In one particularly telling study, Johnson (1996) had people read short paragraphs that ended in either a metaphor or a corresponding simile. People took less time integrating metaphors into the preceding text than their corresponding similes, suggesting that, indeed, metaphors are easier to process than similes. This is clearly inconsistent with the traditional notion that metaphors are understood by ﬁrst transforming them into similes. Instead, they seem to be understood in their own right: as categorical assertions.
Highlighting the literal versus the metaphorical. If metaphor vehicles refer to abstract superordinate categories, then calling attention to the basic-level literal meaning of a metaphor vehicle should make comprehension more difﬁcult. However, priming the literal meaning of a metaphor topic should have no deleterious effect because the topic is used literally. We tested this prediction by priming metaphors either with an irrelevant literal property of the topic, or an irrelevant literal property of the vehicle. People read metaphors such as my lawyer was a shark, preceded by (a) neutral control sentences, such as some tables are made of wood, (b) irrelevant topic-property sentences, such as some lawyers are married, and c) irrelevant vehicle-property sentences, such as sharks can swim. People needed more time to understand the metaphor when it was preceded by the sharks-swim sentence than when it was preceded by either the neutral control or the irrelevant topic-property sentences (Glucksberg, McGlone, & Manfredi 1997; McGlone & Manfredi, 20026). Apparently, calling attention to the basiclevel, concrete referent of a metaphor vehicle interferes with its intended function, that is, reference to the corresponding superordinate metaphorical category.
If metaphor vehicles do refer to superordinate categories and not to their basic-level exemplars, then understanding a metaphor should be comparable to understanding any ambiguous utterance. When people understand homonyms in context, such as the

word bank in the context of money, then the contextually inappropriate meanings of the word – such as “riverbank” – are inhibited (Simpson & Kang, 1994). If understanding a metaphor also involves activating appropriate meanings and inhibiting inappropriate ones, then understanding a metaphor should involve inhibiting the basic-level, literal meaning of the metaphor vehicle. Gernsbacher, Keysar, Robertson, and Werner (2001) asked people to read either metaphors, such as my lawyer was a shark, or literal statements, such as the hammerhead is a shark, and then to verify statements related to the literal meaning of the metaphor vehicle, such as sharks are good swimmers. People were much slower to verify literal property statements following metaphors than following literal assertions, suggesting that literal meanings of metaphor vehicles are inhibited during metaphor comprehension. We replicated this ﬁnding and, in addition, demonstrated that the effect is due to active inhibition of irrelevant, literal meanings, not just to strategic retrieval strategies (Glucksberg, Newsome, & Goldvarg, 2001). In this respect, metaphor comprehension involves the same comprehension mechanisms that are used for literal language comprehension (see, for example, Gernsbacher & Faust, 1991).
Metaphors Are Not Similes
UNDERSTANDING METAPHORS VERSUS
UNDERSTANDING SIMILES
A basic assumption underlying virtually all theories of metaphor is that metaphors and similes are, fundamentally, equivalent: they mean the same thing. This assumption is shared not only by comparison theorists, who hold that metaphors are fundamentally comparisons and processed as such, but also by categorization theorists. Comparison theorists such as Gentner and her colleagues, for example, argue that any given metaphor can be understood either as a simile, that is, a comparison assertion, or as a categorization, that is, a class inclusion assertion. They argue further that whether a metaphor is understood as a comparison or

HOW METAPHORS CREATE CATEGORIES – QUICKLY

75

as a categorization assertion depends on its familiarity. Novel metaphors are invariably understood as comparisons. With repeated use, metaphors become conventionalized and can then be understood as categorization assertions and processed as such. They refer to this argument as the career-of-metaphor hypothesis. (Bowdle & Gentner, 2005 ). This view obviously depends critically on the assumption that metaphors and their corresponding similes mean the same thing.
Categorization theorists rely just as critically on this assumption, that metaphors and similes are virtual paraphrases of one another. Whereas comparison theorists argue that metaphors are understood as implicit similes, categorization theorists argue that the opposite is true: that similes are understood as implicit categorization assertions. Metaphors are not understood by transforming them into similes. Instead, they are intended as class-inclusion statements and are understood as such. When metaphors are expressed as comparisons, then they are interpreted as implicit category statements, rather than the other way around (Glucksberg, 2001; Glucksberg & Keysar, 1990). Recent evidence on how people understand metaphors and their corresponding similes suggest that both comparison and categorization theories are wrong in this respect. Metaphors and similes differ systematically, and so neither can be interpreted in terms of the other.
Consider, ﬁrst, how people interpret metaphors and their corresponding similes. Ostensibly, metaphors and similes should yield comparable interpretations, with metaphors, perhaps, being somehow more “vivid” (Ortony, 1979). We tested this notion directly, by asking people to paraphrase either metaphors or their corresponding similes. Half the participants in this experiment paraphrased metaphors, the other half similes. For the expression some ideas are like diamonds, typical paraphrases included responses such as some ideas are rare and desirable, some ideas are so interesting it is as though they shine and glitter, and some ideas are very valuable. The italicized properties that were attributed to

some ideas – rare, desirable, shine, glitter, valuable – are all properties of the literal diamond. This suggests that the predicate of a simile does indeed refer directly to the basiclevel concept, in this case the literal gem, a diamond. In contrast, metaphors tended to attribute emergent properties to the topic, properties that inhere in the superordinate category of diamonds as valuable entities but not to literal diamonds. Typical paraphrases of this kind were some ideas are brilliant and insightful and some ideas are fantastic and creatively very unique. Clearly, literal diamonds cannot be insightful, and “creatively very unique” seems a stretch. Overall, metaphors tended to be interpreted in this way, with many more nonliteral, emergent attributions than literal, basic-level ones. Similes tended to attribute about an equal number of each (Hasson, Estes, & Glucksberg, 2001; see Figure 4.3 ). Clearly, metaphors are not just more vivid than similes. Instead, they tend to evoke more emergent properties than do similes. As Richard Russo wrote in his satirical novel of academic life, metaphors are not similes:
Sophomoric Student: “I like the clouds . . . They’re, like, a metaphor.”
Sarcastic Professor: “They are a metaphor . . . if they were like a metaphor, they’d be, like, a simile.” (Russo, 1997)
Although these data clearly show that metaphors and their corresponding similes may differ in their interpretations, the case may still be made that these differences are rather subtle and could well be produced by inferences drawn after initial comprehension. If this is so, then the career-of-metaphor hypothesis might still hold. Novel metaphors would be understood via a comparison process and so would not differ in interpretations from their corresponding similes. Conventional matters might be understood via a categorization operation, and be understood slightly differently from their corresponding similes via postcomprehension inferences. In order to reject both the career-of-metaphor as well as the categorization views that treat metaphors and similes as equivalent, we

need to show two things. First, that novel metaphors, not just conventional ones, can be privileged when in metaphor rather than in simile form. This would directly contradict the career-of-metaphor view, that novel metaphors are understood as comparisons, not as categorization assertions. Second, we need to show that novel metaphors and their corresponding similes can differ sharply in their interpretations. This would contradict the career-of-metaphor argument that novel metaphors are understood as implicit comparisons, that is, similes. On the other side of the coin, it would also contradict Glucksberg and Keysar’s (1990) claim that similes are understood as implicit categorization assertions.
ARE NOVEL METAPHORS BETTER AS SIMILES?
Bowdle and Gentner (2005 ) asked people to judge whether novel and conventional metaphoric assertions were preferable in either metaphor or simile form. They found that novel metaphors were preferred in simile form, while conventional ones were preferred in metaphor form. More tellingly, they found that novel metaphoric assertions were understood more quickly in simile than in metaphor form, while the reverse was true for conventional metaphors. These data seem to support the career-of-metaphor argument. As a metaphor becomes more familiar, the more likely will it be treated as a categorization rather than as a compari-

son assertion. There may, however, be a serious problem with this conclusion. We know from earlier work that novel metaphors are processed just as quickly as comparable literal expressions, but only if the metaphors are apt, that is, if they are good metaphors (Blasko & Connine, 1993 ). The metaphors used by Bowdle and Gentner may have varied not only in conventionality but also in aptness. One very real possibility is that their novel metaphors, such as A ﬁsherman is (like) a spider, were just not very good metaphors. Comparisons are more constrained attributive assertions than are categorizations, and so for poor or limited metaphors, comparisons may be preferred to categorical assertions. Conventional metaphors, on the other hand, would tend to be reasonably good ones; otherwise, they would not have become conventional in the ﬁrst place!
To address this issue, we developed a procedure to generate apt novel metaphors to see whether they would be preferred and more easily understood in categorical rather than in comparison form (Haught & Glucksberg, 2004). We selected a set of apt and comprehensible conventional metaphorical assertions, such as My lawyer was (like) a shark and Some ideas are (like) diamonds. We then made them novel by modifying the metaphor vehicle (for metaphors) or the simile predicate term (for similes), using adjectives that are applicable to the metaphor topic, but not to the literal

metaphor term, as in My lawyer was (like) a well-paid shark or Some ideas are (like) theoretical diamonds. For such constructions, we expected people to ﬁnd the assertion apt and comprehensible in metaphor form because the metaphorical shark can be well paid, and the metaphorical diamond can be theoretical. However, in simile form, the predicate term refers at the literal, basic level, and so these similes should be neither apt nor comprehensible (see Figure 4.4). After all, literal sharks can’t plausibly be well paid, and real, literal diamonds can’t plausibly be theoretical (if they were, then they would be fake diamonds!). These metaphors and similes would provide a counterexample for the career-of-metaphor hypothesis: they would be novel expressions that work in metaphor form, but are difﬁcult to interpret in simile form.
We gave adjectivally modiﬁed metaphorical assertions along with their original, nonmodiﬁed versions to college students in both metaphor and simile forms. One group rated each statement type in terms of how apt the expressions were, that is, how well did they communicate an idea or a characterization of the statement’s topic. An independent group rated how comprehensible or easy to understand each statement was. As expected, the novel metaphors were rated as apt as their original conventional counterparts. However, in simile form, they were rated as much less apt. This ﬁnding supports the dual reference hypothesis, that the metaphor vehicle in similes refers at the literal level, but in metaphors at the superordinate metaphorical level. A metaphorical

shark can plausibly be well paid, but the literal marine creature is not something that can be characterized in terms of salary or monetary income (except perhaps in ﬁsh markets or on restaurant menus). The comprehensibility ratings painted a similar picture, as did response times to judge the sensibility of each type of statement. People took about the same time to judge that the novel and original metaphors were sensible, but the novel similes took much longer to judge than did the novel metaphors. These data are clear. There is no advantage of similes over metaphors for novel metaphorical assertions, whether in terms of rated aptness, rated comprehensibility, or comprehension time. To the contrary, novel metaphors were privileged over novel similes.
But were these metaphors really novel? After all, they were all based on conventional, well-known metaphors. Can we ﬁnd truly novel metaphors that are privileged in categorical over comparison form? Fortunately, Bowdle and Gentner (2005 ) provide the perfect source. They generated truly novel metaphors that are privileged in comparison over categorical form in two ways. First, when asked to rate these metaphors, there was a marked preference for the comparison over the categorical form. Metaphors such as science is a glacier were preferred in comparison form, as in science is like a glacier, while conventional metaphors, such as some jobs are jail, were preferred in categorical form. Second, their novel metaphors were understood more quickly in comparison than in categorical form, while the reverse was true for conventional metaphors. Were these results due to the novelty of the metaphors that were used, or instead to some other characteristic, such as aptness? Jones and Estes (2006) examined this question directly, and found that aptness – that is, how good a metaphor is – accounted for most of the variance in preference for trope form, as well as for differences in comprehension difﬁculty of comparison and categorical forms. But what accounts for relative aptness of metaphors, be they conventional or novel?

78

SAM GLUCKSBERG

One answer to this question is suggested by the ability for most metaphors to be paraphrased quite adequately as similes and vice versa. What makes this possible is the dual reference function of metaphor vehicles, as illustrated in Figure 4.1b. In this conventional metaphor, the vehicle “shark” is polysemous. In the categorical form, it refers to the abstract metaphorical category that we call “sharks,” which includes any creature that is vicious, predatory, aggressive, and which can characterize any living being from card sharks to used car salespeople to lawyers (alas). In comparison form, it refers to the literal marine creature, shark. The shark– lawyer metaphor is apt in both categorical and comparison form because both types of referents are available – the metaphorical as well as the literal. However, we can imagine metaphors for which only one type of referent is available: either for the literal for the comparison form, or for the metaphorical for the categorical form. Some adjectivally modiﬁed metaphors, such as Many corporate lawyers are well-paid sharks, exemplify the metaphorical referent type. Because wellpaid literal sharks do not exist, this metaphor has only the one type of referent, namely, the abstract metaphorical category of predatory, aggressive creatures. Hence, it can only be understood as a categorical assertion, not as a comparison.
In this special case, the metaphor vehicle does not provide the capacity for dual reference because the literal referent – wellpaid sharks – does not exist. Analogously, Bowdle and Gentner’s metaphors also do not provide for dual reference. Here, the relevant abstract categories do not exist, leaving only literal referents available, as in the assertion science is a glacier. This assertion is difﬁcult to interpret in categorical form because “glacier” does not call to mind any interpretable abstract metaphorical category. In contrast, the comparison Science is like a glacier can be interpreted by inviting the addressee to consider properties of glaciers that might be applicable to “science,” perhaps cold and dispassionate, perhaps slow (or as Al Gore might remark, melting down?). How can we render such

metaphors more interpretable in categorical than in comparison form? Simply by modifying them so that instead of having no metaphorical referent, they would now have no literal referent, as in science is (like) an empirical glacier. Since literal glaciers cannot be empirical, science cannot be like them, as illustrated in Figure 4.5 . Other examples of literal-referent metaphors that can be converted to metaphorical-referent ones include A mind is (like) an idea-ﬁlled kitchen, A newspaper is (like) a daily telescope, A billboard is (like) an advertising wart, and Moon light is (like) romantic bleach.7
Using Bowdle and Gentner’s items and their modiﬁed versions (as above), we repeated their experiments to see (a) whether we could replicate their results when using their original items and (b) whether we could completely reverse those results when we used our modiﬁed versions of them. In brief, we replicated their ﬁndings with their original items and reversed them with the modiﬁed items. People again demonstrated a preference for comparison over categorical form for the original, literal-referent metaphors but now demonstrated a preference for categorical over comparison form for the metaphorreferent metaphors. Indeed, the preference ratings for these latter metaphor types were comparable to the ratings for conventional metaphors. More telling, we found that people understood literal-referent metaphors more quickly in comparison than categorical form but found the reverse for the metaphor-referent metaphors (Glucksberg & Haught, 2006a). Apparently, whether a metaphor is understood more easily in

79

categorical versus comparison form does not depend on novelty or conventionality but instead on the referential and semantic properties of the metaphor. As Glucksberg and Haught (2006a) put it, “Different metaphors will have different careers” (p. 9 2 8 ).
CAN METAPHORS AND SIMILES HAVE
DIFFERENT INTERPRETATIONS?
We turn now to a most important characteristic of metaphors and their apparent simile counterparts. We have already seen a case in which novel metaphors are far more apt and comprehensible than their simile counterparts. Can we identify a case in which a metaphor and a simile are equally apt and comprehensible but turn out to have quite different interpretations? If so, then any theory of metaphor that relies on the interpretative equivalence of metaphors and similes must be revised to account for this phenomenon.
We have already alluded to the possibility that a metaphor and its corresponding simile might have distinctly different interpretations. Consider the assertion that my lawyer was/was like an old shark. In the simile form, the predicate old shark refers to the literal marine creature. Old sharks, like old ﬁsh in general, are not particularly attractive. They tend to be past their prime, relatively weak, slow; in short, they have the properties that are stereotypically associated with old age. Accordingly, people should ascribe properties such as ineffectual, weak, and tired not only to the literal old shark but also to the topic of the simile, the lawyer who is likened to an old shark. In contrast, in the metaphor My lawyer was an old shark, the metaphor vehicle refers to the metaphorical shark, not the literal one. Accordingly, people should ascribe properties such as competent, aggressive, and experienced to this shark, as well as to the lawyer who is a member of the category old sharks. Is this difference simply attributable to comparison versus categorization in general.? Not at all. For literal statements such as My lawyer was (was like) an old pro, there seems to be no difference between the categorical and compar-

ison forms. In both cases, My lawyer is considered to be sharp, wise, and experienced.
We gave people metaphors and their corresponding similes for which the literal and metaphorical referents of the metaphor vehicle had distinctly different properties, as in these examples, along with typical interpretations of them:
i. His job was/was like a secure jail. Metaphor: His job was very unpleasant and conﬁning, but it was safe, like having tenure. Simile: His job was unpleasant and conﬁning, like a high-security prison.
ii. Some ideas are/are like small diamonds. Metaphor: Some ideas are very valuable, have a lot of potential, and, if developed, they can become big diamonds. Simile: Some ideas are somewhat valuable and have some potential, but they are still small and therefore disappointing compared to bigger diamonds.
For tropes like these, people consistently provided interpretations that sharply differed between their metaphor and simile forms (Glucksberg & Haught, 2006b). The implications for theories of metaphor are as clear as they are important. Because metaphors and their corresponding similes can differ in interpretation, any theory that assumes the equivalence of metaphors and similes cannot be true. This holds for comparison theories that claim that metaphors are understood by means of a comparison process, as well as categorization theories that claim that similes are invariably understood as categorizations.
Comparison versus Categorization Reconsidered
Since neither a pure comparisons nor a pure class-inclusion theory is tenable, how can we characterize these two processes for comprehending metaphors? The career-ofmetaphor hypothesis seemed promising, but

80

SAM GLUCKSBERG

it ultimately failed for at least two reasons. First, novel but apt metaphors are not privileged in simile form over metaphor form. Second, and more important, similes may not have the same meaning as their corresponding metaphors, and so the theory must be able to account for any changes in meaning as a metaphor becomes more conventional.
An alternative to the career-of-metaphor hypothesis might be the quality-ofmetaphor hypothesis. Really good metaphors work best as categorizations and sometimes work only as categorization assertions (like the well-paid shark example). In such metaphors, the vehicle concept is an ideal exemplar of the category it represents. Poor or limited metaphors might well work best as similes, even when highly conventional. Consider the familiar expression I felt like a sardine in the context of jam-packed, crowded situations. It has a very narrow, indeed unidimensional, predication: to be packed together like sardines in a can. In no other respect is one characterized as a sardine: not ﬁshy, oily, small, or edible. Probably because the attribution of one, context-dependent sardine property is intended, this familiar metaphor doesn’t seem to work as a categorization assertion, that is, I felt I was a sardine doesn’t quite capture the same intention as I felt like a sardine.
For most metaphors, the simile and categorization forms yield the same interpretations. When they appear in metaphor form, they are understood as class-inclusion assertions. When they appear in simile form, there are two possibilities: they could be understood either as implicit categorizations or as comparisons. When, however, a metaphor and its corresponding simile yield different interpretations, then only the metaphor is understood as a categorization. The simile must be understood as a comparison. Finally, when a metaphor cannot be readily understood as a categorization, as in the sardine example or as in the science– glacier example, then it may be interpreted as a comparison but only as a narrowly constrained one. Comparison and categorization may thus be viewed as complemen-

tary strategies for understanding metaphors, with the choice of strategy dependent on the quality and aptness of the metaphor. Comparisons are resorted to when a categorization doesn’t make much sense; categorizations are used when a metaphor is apt, even when it is a novel metaphor.
Conclusions
We began our discussion of metaphor comprehension by considering three issues: The priority of literal versus ﬁgurative meanings, the role of comparison processes in metaphor comprehension, and the relation between a metaphor’s and a simile’s meaning. We reached three important conclusions.
1. Literal meaning does not have unconditional priority. Metaphor comprehension, like language comprehension in general, is automatic and mandatory. We cannot refuse to understand, and when metaphoric meaning is available, it will be processed (Giora, 2003 ; Glucksberg, 2001; Keysar, 1989).
2. Metaphors are not generally understood as comparisons, but comparisons may well be understood as categorizations, whether they are literal or ﬁgurative. Similes, in general will be understood as implicit categorizations, but only when their corresponding metaphors are apt.
3 . Metaphors and similes are not always interchangeable. Because of the dual reference function of metaphor vehicles, these two forms can express different meanings, sometimes subtly different, sometimes quite sharply so. Indeed, not only can the two forms yield different interpretations, in some cases an expression may work only in metaphor form (as in the wellpaid shark example) and in others only in simile form (as in the sardine example). This suggests very strongly that both comparison and categorization processes can be employed for understanding metaphors. An issue for future research to resolve is, what are the circumstances that lead to the choice of one over the other strategy for understanding both similes and metaphors?

HOW METAPHORS CREATE CATEGORIES – QUICKLY

This issue is as yet unresolved, either for literally or ﬁguratively intended comparison assertions.
And, to return to our autistic savant Christopher Boone, we can reassure him that metaphors are not lies, and they are not similes either!
Notes
1 For metaphors of the form X is a Y, X is the topic of the assertion, and Y the vehicle. In the surgeon–butcher example, the topic surgeon is assigned to the vehicle category butchers and inherits salient properties of that vehicle category, such as grossly incompetent. In the context of surgeon, incompetence is instantiated as bloody, causing bodily injury, and so. For the metaphor my butcher is a surgeon, topic and vehicle roles are reversed and now the topic butcher inherits stereotypical properties of the vehicle category surgeons, for example, precise, expert, skillful.
2 Some metaphorically intended utterances or expressions may well pose interpretative problems and hence take longer to understand. Indeed, some may be uninterpretable for some people in some circumstances. For a villager in Nepal who is unfamiliar with American corporate greed and practices, an expression such as “There’s going to be many more Enrons down the road” would be completely opaque. Closer to home, non-apt attempts at metaphor, such as “a mind is a kitchen” or “a ﬁsherman is a spider” (Bowdle & Gentner, 2005 ) are difﬁcult to interpret and may well take a lot of time and distress. Even seasoned journalists can leave their readers hopelessly muddled in their zeal to coin novel expressions, as in this excerpt from an article on Martina Hingis’s negative opinions of contemporary women’s tennis: “As the cerebral point choreographer with the famous Chucky Doll grin, she used to inspire the glamour lugs on the women’s tour to stretch their minds when they clomped on the court to play her” (Roberts, 2004, p. D1).
3 The interchangeability of similes and metaphors works most of the time, but as we shall see, this is not a universal property of similes and their corresponding metaphors.
4 The two levels of abstraction involved in metaphor versus simile are reﬂected in the deﬁnition of metaphor in the Oxford English

Dictionary (1996): A thing considered as representative of some other (usually abstract) thing: A symbol. The literal shark is representative of the metaphorical shark category, and so can be used as a symbol of that category, as well as a referring expression for it. 5 This last phenomenon has the most critical implication for theories of metaphor comprehension. If metaphors and their corresponding similes can have quite different interpretations, then any theory that requires this last phenomenon has the most critical implication for theories of metaphor comprehension. If metaphors and their corresponding similes can have quite different interpretations, then any theory that requires metaphors and similes to “mean” the same thing, such as comparison theory, cannot be viable. 6 This ﬁnding is analogous to Klein and Murphy’s (2001) demonstration that polysemous words – words that have different but related senses, such as wrapping paper and daily paper – do not prime one another. Apparently, the literal and metaphorical senses of metaphor vehicles behave much like the several senses of polysemous words. 7 Lest the reader doubt that such expressions can appear in normal text or conversation, consider this metaphor from the New York Times sports pages: “Coach Herman Edwards had appealed to his players’ vanity leading up to the game. Their pride was the garlic clove that Edwards waved to stave off pessimism’s bloodthirsty advances” (K. Krouse, October 25 , 2005 ). Like our experimental items, this metaphor has no possible literal referent, and so is distinctly infelicitous in comparison form; that is, Like the garlic clove just doesn’t work here.

CHAPTER 5
A Deﬂationary Account of Metaphors∗
Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson

Are metaphors departures from a norm of literalness? According to classical rhetoric and most later theories, including Gricean pragmatics, they are. No, metaphors are wholly normal, say the Romantic critics of classical rhetoric and a variety of modern scholars ranging from hard-nosed cognitive scientists to postmodern critical theorists. On the metaphor-as-normal side, there is a broad contrast between those, like the cognitive linguists Lakoff, Talmy, or Fauconnier, who see metaphor as pervasive in language because it is constitutive of human thought, and those, like the psycholinguists Glucksberg or Kintsch, or relevance theorists, who describe metaphor as emerging in the process of verbal communication.1 While metaphor cannot be both wholly normal and a departure from normal language use, there might be distinct, though related, metaphorical phenomena at the level of thought, on the one hand, and verbal communication, on the other. This possibility

Relevance theory’s approach to metaphor is deﬂationary. Most rhetorical, literary, and philosophical traditions emphasize both the importance and the distinctiveness of metaphor. We acknowledge its importance but dispute its distinctiveness. Certainly, metaphors are ubiquitous in language use and contribute to what Barthes called “le plaisir du texte.” Speciﬁc uses of metaphors by individual authors or in given literary genres are indeed worthy of study, and so is the very idea of metaphor as a culturally salient notion with a long, rich history. Still, we see metaphors as simply a range of cases at one end of a continuum that includes literal, loose, and hyperbolic interpretations. In our view, metaphorical interpretations are arrived at in exactly the same way as these other interpretations. There is no mechanism speciﬁc to metaphor, no interesting generalisation that applies only to them. In other terms, linguistic metaphors are not a natural kind, and “metaphor” is not a
