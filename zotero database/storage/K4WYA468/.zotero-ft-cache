Introduction
This book is inspired by the theme session “Intersubjectivity and Language: The Interplay of Cognition and Emotion” held at the 10th International Cognitive Linguistics Conference in Krakow, Poland, in July 2007. As organizers of the session, we felt that an interdisciplinary volume on this matter would be an appropriate follow-up. In addition to contributors from the theme session, we invited authors who are well known in the field. Their positive response led to a total of 16 papers, which we grouped into 3 Parts: I Consciousness, II Intersubjectivity, and III Language. We asked each of the contributors to discuss these ‘higher functions’ of the human mind from the foundational perspective of motion and/or emotion (See Figure 1 in the Prologue). The polyphonous result contains, we think, many harmonizing but also some disharmonizing tones. As such, the volume constitutes a relevant contribution to the actual discussions in the humanities with respect to the human mind. The 16 papers are framed by a Prologue and an Epilogue. Jordan Zlatev, one of the editors and also co-author of one of the papers in Part III, wrote the Prologue in which he introduces each paper in the overarching perspective of motion and emotion. Colwyn Trevarthen, co-author of one of the papers in Part II, followed our request to write an Epilogue, in which he reflects on the contributions of the volume and places them in a historical perspective.
Editing a voluminous collection as the present one does not involve much motion, besides moving fingers and hand on keyboard and mouse. A good deal of emotion was and is involved, however. Above all feelings of thankfulness. First of all, our gratitude goes to the authors for their work and patient cooperation over the years that the volume took shape. Secondly, we thank the colleagues who were willing to act as anonymous reviewers for the different papers. Special thanks go to Ralph Ellis, co-editor of the Consciousness & Emotion Book Series in which this volume is being published. Ralph has given us useful support along the way and even felt inspired to contribute, with Natika Newton, with a chapter. Thanks are also due to Hanneke Bruintjes and Els van Dongen, Acquisition Editors at Benjamins, who guided us through a time plan that we broke more than once. Finally, we thank Wessel Stoop, student assistant to Ad Foolen, who took care of formatting the contributions and uploading them on a website, so that authors and editors always had access to the latest versions of the texts.
After completion of the volume, hope and confidence are the dominant feelings on our side. Confidence that there is an interesting path before us, on which it will be

 Moving Ourselves, Moving Others
pleasant and exciting to move forward to a science of the mind. We hope that this book inspires the reader to join us on this path.

1.  Why ‘motion’ and ‘emotion’?
This book emerged as a happy coincidence. Or was it perhaps a matter of unplanned, but non-accidental “distributed cognition”? In retrospect it seems that it was something that was just waiting to happen. Based on our edited volume The Shared Mind (Zlatev et al. 2008), Tim Racine, Chris Sinha, Esa Itkonen and myself proposed a theme session with the title “Intersubjectivity and Language” to the 10th International Cognitive Linguistics Conference, held in Krakow, Poland, in July 2007. At the same time, Ad Foolen and Ulrike Lüdtke independently proposed a session on “­Language and Emotion”. Both proposals were accepted, but we were urged to ­combine them, and the outcome was the stimulating whole-day workshop “Intersubjectivity and Language: The Interplay of Cognition and Emotion”.
The first fruit of this, at first glance coerced, synthesis was the linking of the topics of intersubjectivity and emotion. While Zlatev et al. (2008: 1, 3) had defined the first of these notions as “the sharing of experiential content (e.g. feelings, perceptions, thoughts, linguistic meanings) among a plurality of subjects” and had stated that such “sharing of experiences is not only, and not primarily, on a cognitive level, but also (and more basically) on the level of affect, perceptual processes and conative (action-oriented) engagements” – emotion was not explicitly thematized in that predecessor to the present volume. This was clearly a blind spot in the programmatic attempt to frame the concept of intersubjectivity as an alternative to the cognitivist perspective of “theory of mind”, which still dominates large parts of the field of social cognition.
A second, and equally important, insight that emerged from the workshop was the close link between (inter)subjectivity and bodily motion, or movement. Again, it is not that Zlatev et al. (2008: 3) had neglected the essential role of the body and its various forms of “movements” for the understanding of self and others: “Such ­sharing and understanding are based on embodied interaction (e.g. empathic perception, imitation, gesture and practical collaboration).” Similarly, various traditions

 Jordan Zlatev
(all reflected in the present volume) can be seen as converging on this theme: from the phenomenological analyses of Husserl and Merleau-Ponty, the developmental psychology of Piaget, the social interactionism of Mead – to more modern discussions of the “embodied mind” (Varela, Thompson & Rosch 1991) and “mind as motion” (Port & van Gelder 1995).
Still, what arguably remains underexplored is the degree to which movement is intimately linked to “the passions”, the “movements of the souls”, the emotions, feelings… – or to use a common recent term, affectivity. One might reconsider this under-exploration quite surprising, given the close etymological and ­semantic relations between the terms ‘motion’ and ‘emotion’ (Bloem this volume; Zlatev et al. this volume).
On the one hand, affectivity both motivates bodily movement, and is expressed in it. But as William James (1884: 197) already pointed out, the causal relation between affectivity and bodily motion, and thus between “mind” and “body”, goes both ways: “Everyone knows how panic is induced by flight, and how giving way to the symptom of grief increases those passions themselves. Each fit of sobbing makes the sorrow more acute, and calls forth another fit stronger still…”
Such an “emotion complex” is public, and affects others, at various levels of awareness. In moving ourselves, we move others; in observing others move – we are moved ourselves. The fundamental importance of this (at first glance) simple observation for our phenomenal experience of the world and of ourselves (i.e. consciousness), our connectedness with and understanding of others (intersubjectivity) and for language is the topic of this book. This can be graphically represented as in Figure 1.

Prologue 

2.  Bringing motion and emotion back together again

It is characteristic that in the “first generation” of cognitive science, labeled “cognitivism” by Varela et al. (1991), emotions, along with the body in general, as well as intersubjectivity (and sociality and culture more generally), were neglected. In the mind-as-computer paradigm, emotions appeared, if at all – as a special cognitive sub-routine that could be added to, or detached from the cognitive system at will.1 When the central role of emotions for basic cognitive processes such as learning and choosing among alternative actions, was realized, this was still a very disembodied, functionalist view, “defining emotions in terms of their role in the mental economy” (Evans 2001: 146). Even when, after advances in neuroscience, it was recognized that practically every cognitive process was also emotionally “valenced” (as e.g. shown by activations in the limbic system), the centrality of emotional experience, i.e. feelings, was denied in an influential book on the subject:

Emotions evolved not as conscious feelings, linguistically differentiated or

otherwise, but as brain states and bodily responses. The brain states and bodily

responses are the fundamental facts of an emotion, and the conscious feelings are

the frills that have added icing to the emotional cake.



(LeDoux 1996: 302 our emphasis)

In “second generation” cognitive science, involving neuroscience and “embodied” robots rather than just software, such a view is still prevalent:

… many people seem to regard feelings as the essence of emotion, but this is not

the view of most contemporary scientists and philosophers who study emotion.

From the viewpoint of modern science, it would be as foolish to deny that a

computer can have emotions just because it lacked conscious feelings as to deny

that a paralyzed person could have emotions because he could not make the

relevant facial expressions.

(Evans 2001: 171)

Such general pronouncements on behalf of “contemporary scientists and philosophers”, as well as the analogy between the machine and the paralyzed person, should, however, be questioned. With the turn of the millennium, if not earlier, consciousness has been “re-habilitated” as a subject worthy of science, and a growing number of scientists (and not just philosophers) admit that whatever other aspects the English word ‘mind’ includes (function, behavior, language), if it were divorced from subjectivity, or “first-person” experience, it would be vacuous. The expression ‘mindless’ indicates

1.  The super-intelligent android Commander Data in the TV-series Star Trek, Second Generation in the late 1980s was in one episode given an “emotion chip”, with nearly disastrous consequences.

 Jordan Zlatev
this fact: we say that something is done mindlessly precisely because it lacks subjectivity.2 In this respect the work of Damasio (1999, 2003), which has an explicit focus on consciousness as phenomenal awareness, on the complex interrelations between emotions as “brain states and bodily responses”, feelings and selfhood needs to be acknowledged.
But especially from the standpoint of the present volume, Damasio’s view of emotions/feelings as above all concerned with evaluation of “in-coming” sensations, and the body’s state in general, is insufficient. First, it is not active enough and misses the link between emotion and self-motion (see Ellis and Newton this volume). Second, it is not intersubjective enough. A fairly established classification of emotions distinguishes between “basic” (Ekman) or “primary” (Damasio) emotions: joy/pleasure, distress, anger, fear, surprise, distress – and “higher cognitive” or “secondary” emotions such as love, guilt, pride, shame, embarrassment, envy. While the second set are acknowledged to be “social”, since they are directed to, or otherwise presuppose relations to others, the “basic” emotions are claimed to be object-directed, automatic (involuntary) and universal, with both (facial) expressions and bodily/brain reactions built in through evolution. But clearly the expressions of the basic emotions would be superfluous if not involved in communication, and it is obvious that they play an important role for empathy, the capacity for “feeling in” (Einfühlung) or sympathy, “feeling with” someone else. In evolutionary terms, basic emotions must have been selected for due to their contribution to survival and reproduction through their “social functions”. The neuroscience of empathy, as well as intersubjectivity in general, received a big boost with the introduction of the notion of “mirror neurons” in the early 1990s (Di Pellegrino et al. 1992), especially since the original discovery of neurons in the pre-motor cortex of macaques responding to performed as well as observed actions was extended and generalized to human beings, and to other brain areas, including the amygdala, which was shown to be active in a similar way both when people experience certain emotions, and when they observe others doing so (e.g. Adolphs 2003).
But if at its most basic level, empathy involves processes of “bodily resonance” (Gallagher, this volume), or “the passive or involuntary coupling or pairing of my living body with your living body in perception and action” (Thompson 2007: 392), then it is not just the specialized (facial) expressions manifest in basic emotions, but the perception of bodily movements in general, including postures, hand movements, gaits, involuntary movements like yawns and scratches etc. that become relevant. Indeed, the edited volume On Being Moved (Bråten 2007), which like the present book utilized the polysemy of the English verb ‘move’ (cf. Reddy this volume), made

Prologue 
this generalization, linking the work from developmental psychology by Colwyn Trevarthen, Daniel Stern and others on infant intersubjectivity and the development of a sense of self to “mirror neuron” neuroscience.
Still, this synthesis did not go far enough. For one thing, the debates on the proper interpretation of the empirical evidence concerning “mirror neurons” continues (see Gallagher this volume; Racine et al. this volume). But perhaps more relevantly, as the passive construction in the title of Bråten (2007) implies: the focus is on the “passive and involuntary” aspects of interpersonal emotion, not on the active, “animate” (Sheets-Johnstone this volume) or “enactive” (Ellis & Newton this volume) nature of the mind – where motion, emotion and (inter)subjectivity can be argued to meet most intimately.
Ellis and Newton (this volume) suggest that proponents of the concept of enaction, originally defined as “a history of structural coupling that brings forth a world… [t]hrough a network consisting of multiple levels of interconnected, sensorimotor subnetworks” by Varela, Thompson and Rosch (1991: 206) have “emphasized the importance of action as a necessary grounding of consciousness, but without stressing that the difference between action and mere reaction is interconnected with the difference that emotion makes.” This is so, in particular with respect to the work of some “enactivists” such as Noë (2004). However, in another recent book, Mind in Life: Biology, Phenomenology and The Sciences of Mind, Thompson (2007) has made a commendable effort in performing what the title of the present section states: bringing motion and emotion back together again. Based on a (re-)reading of the classics of phenomenology (above all Husserl, but also Scheler, Merleau-Ponty, Patočka and Stein), lifting up their arguments for the relevance of the “lower” emotional and bodily aspects of consciousness and intersubjectivity, and connecting this to the recent literature on enaction and “neurophenomenology” (e.g. Freeman 2000), Thompson provides a substantial contribution to articulating a coherent and productive program for a new science of the mind – one that embraces consciousness, in its various manifestations, unlike the reductionist program(s) of cognitive science mentioned earlier. In Chapter 12, devoted to “valence and emotion”, Thompson (2007: 364) writes:
There is thus a close resemblance between the etymological sense of emotion – an impulse moving outward – and the etymological sense of intentionality – an arrow directed to a target, and by extension the mind’s aiming outward or beyond itself toward the world. Both ideas connote movement. This image of movement remains discernable in the abstract, cognitive characterization of intentionality in phenomenology. […] intentionality is no mere static aboutness, but rather it is a dynamic striving for intentional fulfillment. In genetic phenomenology, this intentional striving is traced back to its roots in “original instinctive, drive related preferences” of the lived body (Husserl 2001: 198). Husserl calls this type of intentionality drive-intentionality” (Triebintentionalität) [...]. Patočka

 Jordan Zlatev

calls it “e-motion.” This term connotes movement, its instigation by “impersonal

affectivity”, and the dynamic of “constant attraction and repulsion”



(Patočka 1998: 139)

Thus, the present volume can be seen as a further contribution to the elaboration of such a dynamical, active view of emotion (cf. Lüdtke this volume), along with an affect-laden view of motion – and to explore their significance for consciousness (phenomenal awareness as such), intersubjectivity, and language – as well as the close links between them.
In this respect, it is an instance of an emerging field, which following Evan Thompson can be called mind science. As with cognitive science, the perspective is interdisciplinary: the authors of the chapters here included are philosophers, neuroscientists, psychologists, primatologists and linguists who – alone, or in collaboration – “transgress” the boundaries of their respective fields. But while cognitive science, in both “first generation” and “second generation” (cf. Gallese & Lakoff 2005) forms, was and continues to be centered on notions such as “computation”, “informationprocessing” and “symbolic representation”, mind science focuses explicitly on what is most intrinsic to the mind: phenomenal experience, consciousness. Unsurprisingly, the influence of phenomenology is acknowledged in most of the contributions in this volume (Sheets-Johnstone; Ellis & Newton; Overgaard; Reddy; Gallagher; Fultner; Racine et al.; Zlatev et al.), though as mentioned, other theoretical traditions are important as well: the work of Habermas (Fultner; Frank and Trevarthen), Wittgenstein (Racine et al.), Mead (Carpendale & Lewis), Piaget (Carpendale & Lewis, Günther & Hennies), among others.
Therefore, the chapters are ordered not in terms of the disciplines represented, but in terms of where the primary relevance of their discussion of (e)motion lies: Consciousness, Intersubjectivity or Language. Of course, a meta-theme of the book, as reflected in the title of the workshop from which it emerged, is the interrelations between these three notions, so this division should be taken as approximate. Furthermore, the reader should note that while all authors consider both bodily motion and emotion, and most do so to an equal extent, some place their focus more on one than the other.
In the remainder of this prologue, I briefly summarize the chapters of the volume in relation to the themes of the book, and point out some connections, as well as (possible) disagreements between the authors. I also provide brief comments, with which the reader should feel free to disagree. My intention with this somewhat unorthodox approach for a co-editor is to open up the discussion, rather than to place myself in the position of “objective” referee, which of course would be self-defeating. Summaries from the authors’ own viewpoints are provided in the abstracts that precede each chapter, and Colwyn Trevarthen’s Epilogue offers a somewhat different, and no less valid perspective on the themes of the chapters, and on the book as a whole. My conviction

Prologue 
is that such “polyphony” is an inherent part of any dialogical (or multi-logical) enterprise, and not in any way as detrimental for the coherence of the book.
3.  Part I: Consciousness
‘Consciousness’ is a proverbially difficult concept, but as with the near-synonym ‘mind’, it’s most central aspect is that of subjectivity, or sentience: the experience of ‘being’ – something more basic than being a ‘self ’, which in phenomenological parlance is something constituted through experience, in interaction with things and with others: subjectivity and inter-subjectivity are, as already pointed out, closely related.
Sheets-Johnstone is a prominent “mind scientist” in the sense given in the previous section, combining phenomenology, evolutionary theory and empirical research on the theme of this book in the influential monograph The Primacy of Movement (1999). Her text in the present volume, summarizing previous work and going beyond it, is perhaps the most radical one. This makes it, along with the author’s contributions to the field, appropriate to serve as a beginning to the part devoted to consciousness. Sheets-Johnstone finds even notions such as enaction and embodiment to be “band-aids”, meant to mend the gaps left by dualistic conceptions rather than genuine solutions. Instead she defends, conceptually and empirically, a fundamentally nondualistic notion, animation, boldly stating from the onset that “we are essentially and fundamentally animate beings. In more specifically dynamic terms, we are animate forms who are alive to and in the world, and who, in being alive to and in the world make sense of it. We do so most fundamentally through movement.” On the basis of evidence from evolutionary theory and ethology (with multiple references to Darwin), developmental psychology, dance, and experiments with hypnosis she furthermore argues for a “dynamic congruency of emotion and movement” – in both (external) expression and (internal) generation processes.
One may, however, ask whether some of Sheets-Johnstone’s claims are not somewhat too radical and her critiques towards alternatives – too sharp. For example, one kind of “received ignorance” that is rejected in the chapter – the dictionary definition of motion as “change of position” – is rather interpreted by Zlatev, Blomberg and Magnusson (in Part III), as a different, but equally valid perspective on motion: a thirdperson, observational one. Furthermore, by rejecting any “evolutionary discontinuities” Sheets-Johnstone implies degrees of consciousness and emotion in even the simplest organisms, such as motile bacteria (cf. Thompson 2007: 161), thereby equating mind and (animate) life.
In comparison, Ellis and Newton’s theoretical proposal, summarizing their recent book (Ellis & Newton 2010), is considerably more cautious. In fact, the authors explicitly guard against what they view as a number of related “pitfalls” in the

 Jordan Zlatev
current literature on motion, emotion and consciousness. One such is to regard selfmovement as sufficient for consciousness, which would imply consciousness not only for amoebas, but for certain self-organizing systems such as traffic-patterns. Another is not to distinguish between movements as externally induced reactions and selfinitiated actions. Emotion, in the sense of motivational processes, they argue, is essential for this distinction, and this in turn implies a more active role of emotion for consciousness than that expressed by Damasio (see Section 2). Finally, Ellis and Newton argue that even the combination of movement and emotion inherent in actions is not necessary for consciousness, or else a completely paralyzed person would not be fully conscious, which is clearly not the case. Based on a combination of empirical evidence and a notion of “subliminal” action-imagery, the authors instead state their thesis “that possible actions must be imagined by the subject (usually implicitly) in order for that subject to have intentional consciousness of objects.” Hence, they come to a notion of enactive representations subserving (visual) consciousness, unlike “enactivists [who] all too often eschew any role for representations of the environment, and therefore reject action imagery as opposed to overt action in providing a grounding for the understanding of objects.”
Ellis and Newton thus present a cogent argument for the necessary linking of emotion, (imaginary) movement and consciousness. What one might wish to know more about, though, is the phenomenological status of the central concept of (unconscious) “action imagery”. It is clearly not the same as the Husserl-based analysis of imagery discussed by Thompson (2007: 209): “Visualizing is rather the activity of mentally representing an object or scene by way of mentally enacting or entertaining a possible perceptual experience of that object or scene”. Rather, it seems to be similar to the phenomenological notion of protention, the forward-looking, aspect of time-consciousness, discussed in the following chapter.
Overgaard’s chapter is in several respects complementary to that of Ellis and Newton – and interestingly, reaches conclusions that are in part similar, and in part different. I would suggest that the difference has to do with the fact that Overgaard (implicitly) decides to treat “the problem of perceptual presence” as being independent of emotion/motivation. This problem is a central one for an account of perceptual, and more specifically visual, consciousness: when we observe (opaque) three-dimensional objects, we observe them from one side only: we see what is sometimes called profiles, which may even be in part occluded by other objects. So how is it that we can see threedimensional objects, rather than just disconnected profiles (or parts)? As Overgaard summarizes in his exceptionally clear phenomenological exposition (even for readers unfamiliar with the literature): “The proposal is marvellously simple. According to both Husserl and the enactive account, the basis of the availability of absent profiles is found in what Husserl calls our “kinaesthetic capacity” and Noë refers to as “sensorimotor skills” (Noë 2004: 63). It is, in other words, because we are able to move and

Prologue 
thereby change our perspective on things that we have a perceptual sense of the copresence of absent profiles.”
The “enactive account” of perception is thus that it is based on self-movement. Furthermore, Overgaard explains that this does not imply actual self-movement, but that “a subject has some (implicit) understanding of how visual appearances would change if such-and-such kinaesthetic capacities were exercised”. Thus at least for Husserl, if not for Nöe, this would not imply falling in one of the “pitfalls” discussed by Ellis and Newton – the claim that perceptual consciousness is based on actual movement. Nevertheless, Overgaard shows that there is ambiguity in interpreting the enactive thesis: that the condition of perceiving external objects is (a) “having an implicit understanding of oneself as potentially moving or being moved…” or (b) “having had experience of active self-movement…” Overgaard defends (a) from philosophical critiques, both outside and inside phenomenology – but concludes that (b) is too strong. This is so since even experience of passive movement, of being moved around in a wheel-chair as it were, would be sufficient to grant a hypothetical creature the implicit understanding necessary for linking certain movements with certain perceptual changes: “When one such creature is moved, say in a linear fashion, it will surely form implicit expectations (what Husserl calls “protentions”) as to what is coming next.”
This conclusion seems to be in opposition to that of Ellis and Newton – at least with respect to visual consciousness. Overgaard’s argumentation is (as mentioned) meticulous, and indeed, from a purely philosophical (phenomenological) basis, where the goal is to make experience “fully intelligible” it seems as though the strong version of the “enactive account” does not stand up to closer scrutiny. But while the experience of the “passively moved” creatures envisioned by Overgaard is closer to our experience (and thus more imaginable, and thus “intelligible”) than that of the completely immovable “Weather Watchers” (rejected as counterexamples to (a) on that ground), it is also importantly different. As the author states toward the end: “To be sure, the visual experiences of such creatures would generally be marred by ambiguities. It would be only very occasionally that such ambiguities were resolved for them, and when this happened it would be nothing but a pure stroke of luck. Here we may catch a first glimpse of the enormous difference between their life-world and ours.” So, even if the argument holds, in principle, it should not be taken as carrying over to actual living creatures, and to human beings in particular – which is what Ellis and Newton’s proposal concerns. On a final point: Overgaard’s treatment of protention seems somewhat too passive and lacking in emotion. In contrast, Thompson (2007: 362) writes that “the protentional “not yet” is always suffused with affect and conditioned by the emotional disposition (motivation, appraisal, affective tone, and action tendency) accompanying the flow.” If this is necessarily (or essentially) so, or only for “empirical creatures” like ourselves, is open for discussion.

 Jordan Zlatev
Shanker’s chapter “Emotion-regulation through the ages” elegantly weaves together the two, at first glance very different, temporal dimensions implied in the title: the historical and the developmental. The Illiad, and particularly the character of Achilles, has been used by Plato as an illustration of how disastrous unregulated emotions can be. But as Shanker points out, the reasons behind this breakdown are not to be found in “destiny” (corresponding to our present popular conception of being determined by our “genes”), but lie in the interaction of our biological uniqueness (“temperament”) and educational experiences. The “modern Achilles” is to be found in the many children in the Western world who are given one or another diagnosis such as ADHD, related to a deficit in emotion-regulation or “self-control” – in Sweden popularly called bokstavsbaren, ‘the letters children’. And while an often fruitless debate between accounts in terms of “nature” (biology) and “nurture” (social interaction) rages, the number of “letters children” and their problems, steadily increase. In other words, the issue at stake is the interaction between biology and experience in the formation of a “subjective emotional world.” As Shanker states: “Emotion-regulation affords – and indeed, has afforded from the very moment that Western thinkers started thinking about the mind-body problem – a critical area in which to explore this issue.”
In criticism to the historical metaphor of emotions as “wild horses” that need to be “reined in” by Reason, which has dominated Western thinking up to the present, Shanker emphasizes the indispensable positive role of emotions for the formation of the triangle Self-Other-World. According to the author, few have grasped the significance of the fact that Achilles is finally brought back to sanity not by a “herculean act of rational self-control”, but by a strong positive emotion of compassion. Perhaps, our current predicament would be different “…if it were recognized that emotions are not simply an aspect of the mind that need to be controlled, or worse still, suppressed: that cultivating a child’s positive and prosocial emotions is as important an aspect of emotion-regulation as learning how to control her negative ones”, as the author implores.
More specifically, Shanker summarizes the four-stage model of “emotional transformation” over the first years of life put forward by himself and Stanley Greenspan in The First Idea (Greenspan & Shanker 2004). Being based on increased differentiation from more global states on the basis of physical and social interaction, this model is reminiscent of that of Piaget. But unlike in the latter, affect/emotion is given a pivotal role, and the “schemas” formed are sensory-affect-response, i.e. “affect” serves as a mediator. Furthermore, positive emotions are those that drive development, while negative ones are (mostly) regressive (“If the experience is unpleasant, primitive neural systems trigger an automatic response to avoid the experience”). After a number of such “transformations”, based on interactions with sensitive caregivers, the child

Prologue 
becomes increasingly active and purposeful, beginning “in affective interactions to form high-level cognitive, communicative and social skills”.
Shanker thus clearly represents one of the central themes of the volume: the primacy of emotions, not opposed to, but in consort with cognition. Concerning the second theme, the link between self-motion and emotion, however, it seems that the Shanker-Greenspan infant is somewhat passive: what he/she learns in the first months of life are basically “associations” between sensory stimulation and emotional reactions.
In comparison, Reddy views infants in more active terms, implying rather diversified conscious lives more or less from birth. As the title of the chapter, “Moving others matters”, suggests, Reddy focuses on how ‘moving’ (in the most general sense: “with your being, your actions, your thoughts”) other persons is essential for the constitution of the self: “it matters because it shows us to have been known by others”. As she states toward the end of the chapter, this is not the only source for self-consciousness: movement in the world and moving things is (at least) as important, but “the feel of another consciousness engaging with you” gives rise to mutuality. Distortions of such mutuality result in psychopathology, or in behavior that at least seems to resemble it: cruelty with animals or war prisoners.
Without implying a developmental progression, Reddy reviews a diverse sample of evidence (behavioural, neural, experiential) on infants’ “engaging, expecting, exploring” others: still-face, neonatal imitation, imitation recognition, ‘clowning’, showing off, teasing and others. Her argumentation is often directed against explanations in terms of “contingency learning” or other forms of non-experiential mechanisms. On her account, what is essential is rather the “emotional responsiveness” of another subject, serving as the anticipated outcome of one’s acts.
In emphasizing “the response of the other” and mutuality, Reddy’s chapter bridges over to the central topic of the next section: intersubjectvity. The reader may also discern a certain view, approaching consensus among the authors represented in the volume: a view of development as piecemeal and gradual. Reddy makes it clear that she is skeptical of “stages” in the development of (inter)subjectivity. By emphasizing early onset and continuity the implication is that the basic interpersonal aspects of our consciousness, and the ‘social emotions’ related to these, run very deep. The case for this is indeed persuasive. Still, the evidence reviewed, here and in the chapters in Part II, shows multiple differences between infants at different ages, and one naturally inquires how novel aspects of consciousness emerge. A second point worth remarking on is that Reddy’s use of the verb ‘move’ is in a sense highly metaphorical (extended), not only from the (literal) physical motion to emotion, but to any kind of action with respect to another subject, with the goal, explicit or not, to elicit a response.

4.  Part II: Intersubjectivity
In the opening chapter of this part, Gallagher provides a welcome historical perspective on the recurrent question: “How are we able to understand other people – their intentions, their behaviors, their mental processes?” Much terminological (and translational) confusion is shown to be in the way, but Gallagher opts for the term empathy, albeit as a Wittgensteinian “family resemblance” concept. Two current debates on the nature of empathy are reviewed. In neuroscience, this concerns the role of “mirror neurons” (or more generally, self-other matching neural circuits). For Gallese, one of the discoverers of mirror neurons, these circuits are (more or less) sufficient for empathy: “I submit that the neural matching mechanism… is crucial to establish an empathetic link between different individuals.” (Gallese 2001: 44). For Decety, and others, “something more” is necessary for fully understanding the other, especially when the perspectives of self and other differ.
The second debate is on what more precisely this “something more” can consist of: a theory-theory (TT) of mind, a simulation-theory (ST) of mind, or Gallagher’s own proposal: an interaction theory (IT). The standard type of evidence in favor of TT have been results from “false-belief ” tasks, but in the author’s interpretation, these may tell us when children develop a concept of belief, but not much about the implicit kind of understanding involved in empathy. The problem for ST, which is currently usually combined with “mirror neuron neuroscience”, is the notion of simulation itself – while there may be corresponding neural patterns involving actions and emotions in the primary experiencer and the observer, it is not clear what would provide the “as if ”, pretense character of these for the observer. The argument is that “the mirror neuron data suggests that rather than simulation, mirror neuron activation is part of the neuronal processes that underlie a form of intersubjective enactive perception”, and Gallagher links this to the notion of primary intersubjectivity of Trevarthen. “Secondary intersubjectivity” involving objects and “contexts of shared attention” is seen as a natural developmental out-growth of this process, rather than a separate stage.
Nevertheless, Gallagher maintains that there is also a more qualitative transition in the development of empathy: this happens around the age of two, and is manifested in pro-social behaviors like consolation, in mirror self-recognition, autobiographical memory and in language. Gallagher follows proposals of J. Bruner, K. Nelson and D. Hutto in attempting to explain the “something more” aspect of empathy as a matter of narrative competence.
Concerning the recurrent issue of stages/levels of other-understanding, we may note that, consolation and self-recognition are present at least in the great apes, and in their often quoted article in the topic, Preston and de Waal (2002) distinguish between a simpler process of perception-action matching and a higher

Prologue 
level of “cognitive” empathy, quite independently of language and narrative. Hence, narrative-based understanding of others would seem to correspond (at least) to a third, rather than to a second level of intersubjective perception (cf. the distinction between secondary and tertiary intersubjectivity made by Bråten and Trevarthen (2007)). Gallagher also does not make it explicit to what extent narratives are based on language; this seems to be assumed by e.g. Hutto (2008), but narrative is conceivably a more general skill that emerges around the end of the second year of life. Finally, while Gallagher writes of “empathy”, the deeply emotional aspect of understanding others is not particularly emphasized in his presentation.
Fultner pays considerably more attention to affective interaction. Somewhat surprisingly, she departs from the pragmatic philosophy of Habermas, and criticizes phenomenology for bringing in “the Other” relatively late into the picture. For Habermas linguistic meaning is fundamentally social: language is essentially communicative action, which on its part is embedded in the lifeworld, at the same time as it constitutes it. The three poles of the lifeworld (a concept that Habermas appropriated from Husserl) consist of background knowledge concerning (a) the (physical) world, (b) the other and (c) the self. In relation to each of these, in any act of communication a speaker makes three kinds of “validity claims”: (a′) to truth, (b′) to appropriateness/ normative rightness and (c′) to sincerity.
Fultner finds, however, this model to display a strong “cognitive bias”: “[Habermas] conceives the lifeworld in overly epistemic terms and pays insufficient attention to the structures of personality and society”. Without stating this explicitly, her further efforts to remedy this show that this cognitive bias is clearly related to a linguistic bias: what the Habermasian lifeworld lacks are precisely embodiment and affect. Relying on the work of Tomasello, Fultner emphasizes pre-linguistic aspects of intersubjectivity such as joint attention. More importantly, and of higher relevance for the present volume, she turns to Bråten’s notions of “altero-centric participation” and “e-motional memory” present according to Bråten more or less from the beginning of life. An indisputably early form of attachment, illustrating the reciprocal nature of primary intersubjectivity, is that which results from the universal practice of nursing a baby. Through this, Fultner illustrates clearly what she means by a claim to attachment, a fourth kind of validity claim, complementing Habermas’s rationalist (and languagecentered) conception of the lifeworld. (Reddy’s analysis, summarized above, could analogously be seen as a “claim to attention”). In a sense, the argumentation revalidates the phenomenological emphasis on the body, perhaps most clearly represented by Merleau-Ponty, quoted in the final sections of the chapter. Thus, Fultner turns full circle to phenomenology and combines diverse philosophical reasoning and empirical justification in a productive synthetic manner, illustrating nicely the point that “understanding intersubjectivity requires a multi-pronged and multi-disciplinary approach such as the one fostered in this volume”.

In their contribution, Racine, Wereha and Leavens ask “To what extent are nonhuman primates intersubjective and why?” For answering this double question they consider comparative evidence from social neuroscience (“mirror neurons”, once more) and behavioural evidence related to (secondary) intersubjectivity, and above all pointing. They argue for overwhelming similarities rather than differences between human beings and apes, and above all against any (non-Darwinian) discontinuity, particularly with respect to intersubjectivity. In the final pages the authors conclude that “the inner life of a great ape is not radically different from our own”.
This is a minority position in the field, as the authors remind us. But they argue for it cogently, on the basis of three composite arguments, all related to bodily motion and emotion. The first is the Wittgensteinian conception that “understanding is not an experience”, but is rather something manifest in behaviour, i.e. goal-directed bodily movement. The second is that one cannot compare the intersubjective skills of children and great apes without considering their “rearing histories”, where two important differences in the latter are singled out. First, children become self-mobile later than apes in ontogeny. While in natural conditions apes can “simply retrieve a desired object … infants learn that they must manipulate the attention of their caregivers in order to retrieve objects”. This gives rise to what is known as “imperative pointing”, and there is indeed evidence that when captive apes face a “problem space” similar to that of human infants, they spontaneously develop the skill. More controversial is “declarative pointing”, in which children point to objects for the sake of others, or for the sake of establishing joint reference to something interesting. While no apes who have not been trained in language (and the referential pointing skills related to it) display this, Racine et al. argue that we cannot conclude from this that children have an innate motivation to collaborate or a more developed understanding of others (as e.g. is done by e.g. Tomasello et al. 2005), since the learning histories of the groups are radically different: children have abundant emotionally rewarding feedback from caregivers in performing such behaviors, while captive apes do not. Finally, the authors bring up currently influential arguments for interaction between evolution and development (many of which are summarized by Thompson (2007, Chapter 7)), which favor multifactor causality rather than genetic determinism and too much emphasis on adaptations, and they suggest that such arguments square in well with the previous two: that understanding as manifest in behaviour, and that differences between children and apes are due to “nurture” rather than “nature”, to put it simply.
Since I have introduced the practice of adding comments for the other chapters, I should also in this case, when one of the authors is a co-editor, note that the reader may have some reservations. One concerns the Wittgensteinian analysis: even if understanding and intentions are not a matter of “private” mental states, they do involve, irreducibly, subjective experience – especially from the phenomenological perspective, referred to in this introductory chapter, as well as in most of the other

Prologue 
chapters in this volume. But even accepting that “to speak about mental capacities is to speak about behavioral capacities and forms of life”, one cannot help but notice major differences in the intersubjective “forms of life” of human and ape infants, even prior to the development of language. Some of these are reasonably due to motoric and contextual differences, but is it not likely that during the 6 million years of evolution since our species split there has been at least some adaptations in our evolutionary history (related to bipedalism, larger groups, brain size, prolonged childhood etc – all favoring higher dependence on sociality), expressed in infants, caregivers or perhaps both? This would be consistent with “evo-devo”, but also with the conjecture put forward in the introduction to The Shared Mind, that human beings are the quintessentially “intersubjective species”.
Carpendale and Lewis review some of the same evidence as Racine et al. and Reddy, and have a similar, though not completely identical theoretical perspective. Interestingly, they attempt to reconcile Piaget, often taken (mistakenly, I believe) as a cognitivist, and G.H. Mead, a canonical representative of the view that mentality originates in social interaction: “Mental processes are fragments of the complex conduct of the individual in and on his environment”, as quoted by the authors. The synthesis is approximately as follows: body (motion) and emotions are “necessary for setting up forms of interaction and routines in which communication can emerge”, but it is the latter through which intersubjectivity, meaning and self-consciousness are constituted. Relevant for human forms of interaction are factors such as infant immaturity, initial short-sightedness, and emotional reactivity. Piagetian “schemes” usually concern interaction with the physical environment, but Carpendale and Lewis treat patterns of social interaction, linked with emotional experience, as “personal or affective schemas”. From initially dyadic, such schemas gradually start involving aspects of the environment, thereby becoming triadic. The ability to take the perspective of the other is also described as a gradual achievement.
With respect to the nature/nurture issue, discussed in relation to the chapter by Racine et al. in the earlier chapter, the authors also emphasize the role of the environment, acknowledging the influence of a “Pan/Homo culture” in forming more human-like intersubjective skills in non-human primates. However, they consider that “a second group of neurological facts may be required for a species to fully profit from such forms of interaction to take them to another level.” Thus, a “history of interaction” seems to be necessary but not sufficient for this higher level of intersubjectivity, itself a precondition for language. The distinction is made in terms of Mead’s notion of conversation of gestures, which are automatic and not intentionally communicative, and significant gestures in which there is anticipation on how the other will respond. Or in terms of the title: from reaching to requesting. But what about the third level: “reflecting and thinking”? Carpendale and Lewis suggest, but do not argue for it explicitly, that this would require language. If so, they would need to part theoretical company

with Piaget (as well as with phenomenology), who rather viewed mental imagery, emerging from interactions and above all imitation, as a precondition for learning linguistic signs (Piaget 1962; Zlatev 2007). Unfortunately, the authors do not state clearly what they mean by “thinking” and “reflecting” in order to decide on where they stand on this theoretically important crossroads.
The extensive chapter by Frank and Trevarthen constitutes a good example of the kind of “multi-pronged approach” to intersubjectivity endorsed by Fultner. Inititially, the authors provide a comprehensive review of research on infant intersubjectivity, from Trevarthen’s now classic writings in the late 1970s, to recent behavioral and neuroscientific studies concerning “rhythmic prospective control”. Emotion and movement are tightly interwoven: development is guided by “innate impulses to move as coherent intentional and conscious selves in emotional engagement with the sensitive responses to the intentions of other persons”. It is emphasized that the infant’s responses are not “simple reactions to stimulation”, but, as argued also by Reddy, intended to provoke further engagement in others. The transition to secondary intersubjectivity around 9 months is described as the formation of a triangle (between subject, object and other) of “emotional appraisals”.
In the second section, Frank and Trevarthen extend child-caregiver intersubjectivity to relations within society, by adopting Bourdieu’s notion of habitus and Habermas’s distinction between lifeworld and system. While the first two concepts are closely related to intersubjectivity, covering notions such as “life-styles”, “embodied attitude” and providing a “sense of belonging”, system institutionalizes these into rigid forms, with the risk of empting them of spontaneity and intimacy. Further, the authors deal with Lotman’s notion of semiosphere connecting it to Halliday’s functional perspective on language. Here too, they see at the core of the phenomena “the mastery of meanings by interpersonal symbiosis, regulated by feelings of affection”, rather than (institutional) rules and norms. Finally, they consider different cases in which, for different (exogenous and endogenous) reasons, the development of intersubjectivity falters: for immigrant mothers disconnected from a community, for mothers diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, and for persons with autism. The most common methods of intervention, Frank and Trevarthen argue, do not get at the heart of the problem, since they aim to constrain the environment, or to provide “system”-like, institutional solutions, rather than emotional engagement.
The chapter is a highly original synthesis of perspectives, making a strong case for the centrality of intersubjectivity in human consciousness, interaction and society. It contains a wealth of ideas and references that I cannot hope to summarize here. However, one thing that is not explained is the manner in which the human potential for intersubjectivty is “innate”, and, indeed, whether it is uniquely human. In the first section, the authors write: “Animal intentions evolve and grow, from the start, with potentialities for intersubjective social collaboration, making their

Prologue 
intelligence communal.” On another point, when Frank and Trevarthen turn to societal factors in later sections, “rules and norms” tend to be portrayed only in negative terms (on analogy with Habermas’s “system”), without making a distinction between intuitive (implicit) and explicit norms. The two are commonly conflated by ­opponents, but can (and arguably, should) be distinguished (Coseriu 2000; Itkonen 2003; Zlatev 2011).
Lüdtke focuses on the role of emotionally-valenced intersubjectivity in language development, and thus serves as a bridge to the chapters in Part III. Beginning with a brief review of the classical theories of language acquisition, she finds that neither those which emphasize individual cognition (in nativist and non-nativist varieties), nor those which focus on interpersonal relations pay proper dues to “the importance of emotions in language or in prelinguistic and linguistic development”. Rather, Lüdtke finds inspiration and suggestive ideas for a truly intersubjective theory of development in the work of Kristeva, with its emphasis on notions such as “desire”, and “body-based materiality”. A further source is the even less-known for the general reader model of emotional regulation of Simonov. A third pillar is semiotics, above all in the Peircian tradition (since unlike Saussure, Peirce was deeply concerned with “feelings”). On this basis, the author proposes an original sign concept, and the outlines of a model of semiotic development, implying “decreasing semiogenetic impact of relational emotions during language acquisition”: from the “iconic mode”, through the “indexical mode” to the “symbolic mode”. Along psychoanalytical (Kristeva and Stern) and Peircian conceptions, such a development, however, does not discard earlier stages/ modes, but rather incorporates them.
Turning to more empirical research, Lüdtke, finds support in the neuroscience of emotion (Damasio, Panskepp), mirror-neuron research, and above all, in Trevarthen’s theory of “innate intersubjectivity as psychophysiological anticipation of an emotionally responding other”, discussed also in the chapter by Frank and Trevarthen and the Epilogue. Based on this concept of intersubjectivity and the earlier theoretical proposals, development is divided in four stages: (1) prenatal primordial intersubjectivity, in which “the foetus appears to have the capacity and motivation to ‘communicate’ with the mother actively by means of body movements that can stimulate her and with growing proprioceptive awareness by self-touching and posture changes that may engage with the actions and feelings of her body”, (2) primary intersubjectivity (in the first year of life), (3) secondary intersubjectivity (the “toddler” years) – both relatively familiar notions, but now interpreted semiogenetically – and (4) tertiary intersubjectivity (in primary school children) “which requires the construction of complete linguistic enunciations constituted to describe a shared abstract object of reference”. As the author explains, the novelty of the model is that it sees the roots of both semiosis and intersubjectivity in prenatal development, and does not posit that the “symbolic order” of language removes emotionality, but rather “subdues” it. Finally, the author

 Jordan Zlatev
presents the outlines of a form of therapy consistent with the model, Relational Language Therapy, which seeks to explain and treat certain disorders which though not linguistic per se affect it negatively by focusing on the transitions between the innate “virtual other” to a “significant other”, and (supposedly) to a “generalized other” with full symbolic competence.
As a truly synthetic approach, Lüdtke’s model has the advantage of bringing together concepts which are usually kept separate by disciplinary borders. At the same time, as with any synthesis, it may be questioned from the proponents of these different “components”. Peircian semiotics is notoriously full of conflicting interpretations, so the author’s linking of the classical triad of icon/index/symbol to corresponding (decreasing) levels of relational emotions will probably raise objections among some semioticians. From a developmental psychology perspective “primordial intersubjectivity” may similarly be hard to accept. Nevertheless, such unusually early development is a more palatable interpretation of “innate intersubjectvity” than what is usually understood by the term “innate”: genetically specified. Finally, the validity of the approach can be defended through its attested value in therapy. And as suggested in the final section, “paradigm shifts” can make what was unthinkable yesterday and difficult to accept today into “revolutionary science” tomorrow.
5.  Part III: Language
Foolen’s chapter provides a comprehensive review of current research on the relationship between language and emotions. As he points out, linguistics (and even more: philosophy of language, I may add) has traditionally underestimated the affective dimension of language, focusing on the “denotational” or “propositional” one. Even with the advent of cognitive linguistics (Lakoff 1987; Langacker 1987), with its emphasis on embodiment and a view of “cognition… as being grounded in motion and action” this was not really rectified. To the extent that emotion has been systematically considered in cognitive linguistics, it has been as “conceptualized” emotion, reflected above all in metaphorical expressions (Kövecses 1990). Foolen accepts that in one respect “cognition serves as intermediate between language and emotion”. However, he points out that emotions are also reflected in the lexicon and grammar more or less directly, “resulting in expressive (also called emotive or affective) language”, as in interjections and other emotion-laden words, in morphology (some uses of diminutives), and in exclamative sentence types and other expressive constructions. As most of the authors in Part III, Foolen addresses the question of why we often speak of emotions “figuratively”. He questions the standard explanation offered by Conceptual Metaphor Theory (Lakoff & Johnson 1980, 1999): that emotions are “abstract” while physical phenomena are “concrete”, and the latter are used metaphorically or ­metonymically

Prologue 
for understanding the first – that is, for the sake of cognition. His p­ roposal is rather that the motivation for figurative expressions of emotion is itself expressive: images related to explosions or dropping hearts are likely to evoke emotions in the addressee. The predominant form of figurative “emotion language” is suggested to be metonymical: in expressions such as my heart sank in my shoes “the physiological effect stands metonymically for the emotional cause”. We should note, however, that such a proposal is controversial, even for the authors in this volume. Racine et al. (this volume) would presumably regard such separation between physiology and emotion to be reflective of a dualistic conception of the mind. Weigand (see below) similarly rejects the literal vs. figurative distinction with respect to mental terms. Zlatev et al. on the other hand, consider both metonymical (contiguity-based) and metaphorical (similarity-based) relations between the “physical” and the “emotional”, while taking a phenomenological take on both: it is a matter of relations between different experiential and not ontological domains.
Foolen concludes by addressing the acquisition and evolution of language, where emotion is increasingly considered to be of paramount importance, as reflected in the chapters by Frank & Trevarthen and Lüdtke in Part II. He lists a number of example fields where insights in emotive language use can have important practical implications.
Günther & Hennies take up one such “real world” phenomenon, and offer what in the present context may be taken as a case study for the importance of emotionallyladen bodily communication: the problems that deaf and hard-of-hearing children face when their parents are instructed to avoid “gestures or signs” and to solely focus on spoken language. Based on a review of recent studies, the authors show that even when such children have been provided with cochlear implants, a large proportion display delayed language acquisition, in both the spoken and written modalities. Even more, such “communication problems lead to equally severe emotional consequences”, and “it is not the diagnosis shock of hearing parents alone which leads to the social and emotional difficulties in a deaf child’s upbringing, but rather the way intervention programs deal with these initial emotions.”
To support their argument for the importance of bodily interaction in languages acquisition, even in the case of hearing children, Günther and Hennies refer to Piaget’s developmental model, according to which at the end of the sensorimotor period in the second year of life, sign use emerges through gestures and action imitation. As pointed out in the discussion of Carpendale and Lewis (this volume), however, Piaget did not attribute any special importance to emotion in this process. Without addressing this lack explicitly, the authors complement it, stating that “pre-linguistic gestures are part of the natural development towards language, especially since they cannot be conceptualized without addressing the emotional binding between mother and child”. The conclusions are consistent with those made by Lüdtke and Foolen in earlier

 Jordan Zlatev
chapters, namely that by unwittingly compromising the emotional dimension latent in spontaneous gestural and linguistic communication between parents and hearing impaired children, purely “oralist” intervention programs affect negatively both the children’s process of language acquisition and their emotional and social development. The implications for the need of interventions based on a multimodal and emotionladen conception of linguistic communication are clear. While the chapter may not be the most profound one in the volume in terms of “theory”, it is perhaps the clearest in terms of practical applications.
Weigand’s contribution can be seen as an argument for re-thinking the notion of language along the line suggested by E.O. Wilson’s (1999) proposal for a “consilience” between the natural sciences, the social sciences and the humanities, with implications going beyond language and concerning human nature as such: “The ‘New Science’ starts from the natural object, living beings, and tries to describe their behaviour and actions by means of goal-directed observation.” The author considers some recent attempts in this direction: the “selfish gene” doctrine of Dawkins (2006), the naturalized semiotics of Deacon (1997), and “the shared mind” approaches of Trevarthen and Zlatev et al. (2008) emphasizing intersubjectivity, but finds them lacking. Her alternative proposal is that human beings are fundamentally “social individuals who act in their own interests but inevitably have to take account of social concerns. In this sense, it is not the dialogic mind but dialogic interaction that characterizes human beings as the dialogic species”.
Weigand presents some of the basic tenets of her specific theory, the Mixed Game Model, and focuses on how it implies a close “interaction of body, emotion, mind, and language”. She emphasizes that notions such as (shared) meaning and understanding are insufficient to account for human interaction: they are always partial and context-bound, and somehow underdetermined. The essence of interaction is rather “reacting, in general by accepting or objecting, i.e. basically evaluating the speaker’s position.”
On Weigand’s account, traditional linguistics, with notions such as “competence” and “performance” are inadequate and “reductionist”, since they distort that object of study: “we have to change our traditional view of language and speaking. There is no separate object ‘language’, only the ability to speak which is an integrated part of human competence-in-performance”. Similarly, “the notion of text must be questioned”, she argues, “as a consequence of the intrinsic interaction of language, emotion and body”. What is central is rather “linguistic action”, and linguistics is not capable of analyzing this alone, without the help of the biological and social sciences. Indeed, in the abstract, she describes her general perspective as that of socio-biology.
More specifically related to the topic of motion and emotion (in language), Weigand argues that to treat expressions such as German gerührt sein (‘to be moved’) as “figurative or metaphorical” would be “an artificial manoeuvre which contradicts

Prologue 
language use. Traditional views … separate the field of perception from cognition and explain diachronic change by a change from concrete perception to figurative cognition or from body to mind. They are based on methodological hypotheses which ‘damage’ the natural object.”
To the extent that theories, linguistic or otherwise, construct strict boundaries between what Weigand calls the “components” of holistic phenomena, and worse: neglect vital aspects, they are indeed open to criticism such as that of the author. However, the reader may have doubts on whether E.O. Wilson’s take on “consilience” is indeed the right path, or even fully consistent with the author’s purposes. In his final book, Gould (2003) criticizes Wilson for misappropriating a concept used by the English philosopher of science William Whewell in 1840. For example, when Wilson (1999: 221) writes: “The central idea of the consilience world view is that all tangible phenomena, from the birth of the stars to the workings of social institutions, are based on material processes that are ultimately reducible however long and tortuous the sequences, to the laws of physics”, it is clear that what Wilson has in mind is clear and simple reductionism. I return to this at the end of this Prologue.
Bloem’s chapter, like that of Günther & Hennies, presents another specific “case study”, this time using the methods of historical linguistics. The topic is one of central relevance for the volume: what is the origin of the English term “emotion”, which so many of the authors of the volume seek to define? It is well-known that it derives from Old French, and earlier from Latin, but Bloem shows on the basis of both qualitative and quantitative analysis of texts from Old French and texts from the XVII century that initially the terms mouvoir and émouvoir were used more or less synonymously, referring either to physical motion, or to the “movements of the soul”, the latter under the influence of the “humoural theory” dating back to Ancient Greece. This changed during the XVII century, and from them on “mouvoir is almost exclusively used as a verb of movement whereas émouvoir has become a real psychological verb. The evolution of the verb émouvoir can be considered a delitteralisation process”. The author argues that the influence of the dualistic philosophy of Descartes played a key role in this process – while mouvement de l’âme was earlier taken to be a literal characterization of the movements of the “four humours” according to the classical theory, it became eventually seen as a metaphorical expression, since emotions were to be seen as part of the mental part of our being. Hence, the expression with the prefix e(s)- (with somewhat unclear etymology, and not necessarily as interpreted by Thompson in the quotation in Section 2 as an “impulse moving outward”) became reserved for the mental counterpart to (psycho)physical movement.
Concerning the controversial issue of nature of metaphor, in general and with respect to the “motion-emotion” metaphors discussed by Zlatev et al. in the following chapter, Bloem takes an intermediary stance: “the impact of supposedly universal and ahistorical metaphors needs to be put in a cultural perspective”, an important

 Jordan Zlatev
corrective to universalist models such as Conceptual Metaphor Theory (CMT). It is thus important not to misinterpret the author’s argument as a purely “linguistic constructivist” account, or even worse, as one putting the blame on “Descartes the Dualist” for more or less inventing the sphere of the mental, a claim commonly encountered in social constructivist circles.
Zlatev, Blomberg and Magnusson, as already pointed out, regard motion and emotion as closely related, but separate experiential domains, and thus analyse expressions such as my heart dropped as “motion-emotion metaphors”. My co-authors and I distinguish three possible answers to the question why such expressions are crosslinguistically common, if not universal. According to the first, stemming from theories such as CMT, the “mappings” between the domains are determined by pre-linguistic, bodily experience. The anti-thesis, “social constructivist” answer would be that linguistic and cultural practices determine such metaphors. The (dialectical) synthesis, which we endorse, is “consciousness-language interactionism”: non-linguistic experience channeled through language-and-culture specific conventions (similar to the proposal of Bloem, mentioned above). We offer empirical support for this thesis by analyzing “115 motion-emotion metaphors in English, Swedish, Bulgarian and Thai”, showing both overlap and differences, the latter correlating with the distance between the languages/cultures.
The study and its conclusions are suggestive of the potential of the “emotion turn” in mind science, witnessed by the present volume, but also actualize a number of unresolved issues. As many of the other chapters, we appeal to phenomenology, and in particular to its “founding father” Husserl for an analysis of motion/­movement. However, in contrast to Sheets-Johnstone (this volume), as already mentioned, we come to the conclusion that motion can be experienced both “internally” as qualitative movement, and “externally” as change-of-location – and argue that languages reflect this difference in the much discussed semantic categories Manner-of-motion and Path-of-motion (Talmy 2000). Also, similar to Foolen, but unlike Weigand, for our analysis of the expressions in question as metaphorical (and metonymical) to hold, it is important that motion and emotion are at some level distinct. Our proposal is that “in historical time some speakers could creatively use expressions referring to such analogous or contiguous (motion) events in the “external world” in order to describe their “inner worlds”, and hearers could understand them, due to the motivated nature of the expressions.” However, Bloem’s historical analysis, summarized above, seems rather to suggest the reverse tendency: with mouvoir and émouvoir being initially conflated, and only subsequently distinguished, in part due to patterns of language use under the (partial) influence of Descartes. Thus, our analysis is likely to be regarded as “dualistic” by those who, in the manner of Sheets-Johnstone, argue that movement and affect are so to say, intermixed, from the start.

Prologue 
6.  Conclusions
Given his important contributions to the topics of this volume – above all on the relationships between intersubjectivity and movement in human development – the editors of this volume found it appropriate to conclude with an epilogue by Colwyn Trevarthen. After having read the final drafts of all the chapters, and a preliminary version of this Prologue, Trevarthen reflects on historical predecessors to the general approach represented here, his own contribution to the field, and offers comments on the chapters, in a way that is quite independent from the summaries provided in the previous three sections. This adds considerably to what at the end of Section 2 was referred to as “the polyphony” of the book. There is an inevitable difference in focus and perspective in the interpretations offered in this Prologue, the authors’ own summaries in the abstracts, and Trevarthen’s final comments. To hide these differences would be to engage in “manufacturing consent”, or to take too literally the notion of intersubjectivity as a “shared mind”, where individual minds and voices are coerced into an anonymous collectivity. While it should be up to the reader to make the final pronouncement in this, I believe that the different voices in this volume complement rather than contradict one another, at least on most issues. To the extent that there are disagreements – including on the definitions of the fundamental notions of “consciousness”, “intersubjectivity”, “language”, “emotion” and “motion” – this reflects the fact that these are all huge notions, with traditions, literatures and in some cases whole disciplines dedicated to them. What all of the authors clearly agree on is that for these concepts to be comprehensively understood, they need to be interrelated, as reflected in Figure 1.
I wish to conclude by expressing my hope that the volume may contribute not only to the already prevalent “emotion turn” in cognitive science, but to the establishment of a true mind science. As stated in Section 2, this can be envisioned as the nonreductive study of the (human) mind, taking account of the richness of experience, uniting its bodily and social aspects in a methodologically pluralistic enterprise: uniting the first-person (“subjective”) perspective of phenomenology, the second-person (“intersubjective”) perspective of (empathetic) observation involved in e.g. interaction studies, and the third-person (“objective”) perspective of the natural sciences. For it to validate itself as a truly new paradigm, it would need to contribute to resolving persistent “anomalies” inherited from the past. Such anomalies are most clearly reflected in dichotomies like “individual-social”, “conscious-unconscious”, “mental-physical”, “reason-emotion”, “literal-metaphorical” etc. Previous attempts to resolve these have typically sought to reduce one of the poles in these dichotomies to the other, typically the more “subjective” to the more “objective” side of the opposition, in the manner of E.O. Wilson’s (misguided) interpretation of “consilience”. The challenge is exactly

 Jordan Zlatev
not to strive at such a reduction, but to acknowledge the existence of these divisions, not as polar opposites but rather as sides standing in dynamic inter-dependence, as in the well-known yin-yang diagram. This would be a science, in the broad sense of the word, which would indeed live up to the original meaning of ‘consilience’, and – in Stephen Jay Gould’s terms – provide a major step to “mending the gap between [natural] science and the humanities”.
Acknowledgements
I wish to thank my co-editors for several rounds of feedback on this text, which was initially intended to serve as a joint introduction. However, since I wrote it myself, and allowed myself in the capacity of “coherence manager” to make some critical observations, to which not all co-editors could subscribe, it was decided to re-organize it as a single-authored Prologue. I also wish to express my gratitude to the authors for the discussions on their chapters, and my sincere hope that even if they disagree with my comments, they would not take this negatively, but as an attempt to add to the coherence of the book and to open up the discussion on the topics that we all care about so deeply. Finally, I need to acknowledge the six year program Centre for Cognitive Semiotics (2009–2014) at Lund University, for financial support and for providing an intellectual environment aiming at the development of a non-reductive, synthetic “mind science”.

Consciousness

Fundamental and inherently interrelated aspects of animation
Maxine Sheets-Johnstone
University of Oregon
This paper shows in detailed ways how animation is the evolutionary and existential ground floor of our being alive in the world and making sense of it, and thus how animation is the proper point of departure not only for basic understandings of perception, affectivity, cognition, meaning, movement, and world, but for basic understandings of the natural interrelationship of these dimensions of life. In the process of doing so, it takes a critical look at certain conceptual approaches that deflect us from a proper recognition and understanding of these multi-faceted realities of animation, or in other words, from being true to the truths of experience.
Keywords:  species-specific kinetic/tactile-kinesthetic invariants; meaning; movement; synergies of meaningful movement; qualitative structure of movement; embodied/embodiment; motorology; semantic congruency; dynamic congruency
1.  Introduction
Given the current practice of applying lexical band-aids in an attempt to marry mind and body, subject and world, third-person and first-person accounts of subjectivity, time, and other topics – lexical band-aids on the order of embodied action, sensorimotor subjectivity, embedded cognition, enactive emotions, and so on – the task of this paper is to recognize and address the need for a concept that embraces all aspects of life and thereby constitutes a key to understanding how all aspects of life – movement, emotion, cognition, sociality, intersubjectivity, communication, language, and more – are inherently interrelated. That key concept is animation: we are essentially and fundamentally animate beings. In more specifically dynamic terms, we are animate forms who are alive to and in the world, and who, in being alive to and in the world make sense of it. We do so most fundamentally through movement, unfolding a temporal-spatial-energic dynamic, a kinetic aliveness that is in play throughout the course of our everyday lives from the time we are born to the time we die. Our kinetic

 Maxine Sheets-Johnstone
aliveness and sense-making are apparent in our initial explorations of the world and in our curiosity about it to begin with. They are apparent, in other words, in the dynamic congruency of movement and emotion (Sheets-Johnstone 1999a): we move in ways coincident with our feelings, which is to say that our bodily attitudes are affectively as well as kinetically resonant. That resonance and sense-making are singularly and centrally apparent in our initial and ongoing attunements and disattunements with those about us and in the developing new attunements and disattunements we forge throughout our lives – with parents, caregivers, playmates, friends, lovers, spouses, neighbors, ­colleagues, employers, and more.
We make sense of ourselves as well. Again, we do so most fundamentally through movement, through our tactile-kinesthetic awarenesses and their invariants as realized in basic if/then relationships; for example: if I close my eyes, it will be dark. ­Consciousness is thus a central aspect of animation, a tactile-kinesthetic built-in of life, a dimension of Nature through and through. Nature is indeed “a principle of movement and change,” as Aristotle lucidly and succinctly observed. Moreover as he went on logically and astutely to observe, “We must therefore see that we understand what motion is; for if it were unknown, nature too would be unknown” (Aristotle ­Physics 2001: 12–14).
Aristotle’s observations validate the fact that animate creatures grow and move about in the world: they navigate with respect to their particular surrounding world, they nourish themselves, they avoid what is noxious, and so on. Science fiction scenarios and philosophical conceivability tales might incline one to think that animate life could exist without consciousness, but the point is that here on earth, that is, here in the real-life, real-time realities of earthly life, animate forms are by nature cognizant of themselves and the world about them (Sheets-Johnstone 1998). Proprioception and affectivity attest emphatically to this reality. Consciousness is thus not something apart from Nature any more than cognition is something apart from Nature. Both are through and through aspects of animation and hence of animate life (for a thoroughgoing empirical vindication of this claim, see Sheets-Johnstone 1998, 1999b/expanded 2nd ed. 2011, especially Chapters 1, 2, 8, and 12; see also Sheets-Johnstone 1990).
The bases on which this chapter will spell out fundamental and inherently interrelated realities of animation will span evolutionary biology, phenomenology, ­coordination dynamics, cognitive science, and psychology.
2.  Morphology
Morphology in the broad evolutionary sense of species-specific and speciesoverlapping kinetic/tactile-kinesthetic invariants provides precisely the stable ­foundation that Darwin specified as necessary to a veridical understanding of

mind: “. . . the ­problem of the mind cannot be solved by attacking the citadel itself. – the mind is function of body. – we must bring some stable foundation to argue from” (Darwin 1987 [1838–1839]: 564). Bodies are indeed the ground floor of animate life. Their kinetic/tactile-kinesthetic invariants – and corollaries thereof, e.g. the proprioceptive slit sensilla of spiders, the campaniform sensilla of insects – undergird the distinctive everyday kinetic dispositions and capacities of each species of animate form. The invariants are, in other words, synergies of meaningful movement. The primate invariants of presenting and mounting, for example, are definitive of two interanimate kinetic relationships that are differentially meaningful, and moreover differentially meaningful according to their agonistic or sexual context. The invariants of the Tanzsprache – the honey bee dance – are similarly meaningful and differentially so according not to social context but to variables within the dance, that is, to distinct qualitative variables inherent in movement that communicate to others the distance, direction, and value, i.e. richness, of a nectar source. In short, meaningful movement is a built-in of all animate life, including all forms of intersubjective life.1
Evolutionary biologist Stuart Altmann’s concept of comsigns attests at an objective, i.e. behavioral, level to the presence of kinetic/tactile-kinesthetic invariants. Comsigns are in essence kinetic ways of relating to others that virtually all in the species are capable of both performing and understanding (Altmann 1967). They are thus species-specific synergies of meaningful movement. Without such commonly understood synergies – in the common but less exacting terms of animal biologists, without such ‘displays’ or ‘signs’ – there would be no basic coherence or order among conspecifics. Indeed, there would be no social animals to begin with since interanimate capacities and understandings would lack all foundation. An absence of comsigns would in fact be a sizable hazard to individual survival within any putative social group since not only would a threatening gesture or movement go unrecognized as would any appeasing gesture or movement, for example, but so also would any courtship and mating gestures or movements.
Species-specific kinetic/tactile-kinesthetic invariants are qualitatively perturbable coalescing patterns of movement, feeling, thought, and awarenesses of the world, thus malleable invariants. The speed of one’s walk, for example, and its amplitude may vary according to intensities of feeling, train of thought, changing climatic conditions, encroaching or receding others, the surrounding world generally, and so on. The kinetic/tactile-kinesthetic invariants that constitute walking remain basically the same, but the dynamic patterning that constitutes the actual synergy of walking at any particular time or place is qualitatively variable. For example, if I want to avoid someone, I might quicken my step and move along an erratic path; if

 Maxine Sheets-Johnstone
I am tired or feeling in a reflective mood, I might amble soberly and slowly down the street. In effect, meaning motivates movement and movement generates and articulates that meaning. A semantically congruent relationship is evident. The semantically congruent relationship is moreover evident in if/then or consequential relationships: if I want to examine something more closely or get within better hearing range, for example, then I move in ways concordant with that desire. Whatever my particular bodily-kinetic dynamic might be, it is meaningfully motivated and my movement articulates that meaning.
It is important to recognize that while motivations are fundamentally and essentially affective in nature, they are commonly conditioned by cognitional awarenesses, precisely as in the above examples. In this context, it is of moment to underscore the difference between experientially-anchored descriptions of the relationship between movement and meaning, as in the above examples, and behavioral accounts of action and purpose. A preoccupation with purpose is at cross-purposes with fine-grained understandings of the experiential realities of animation; a verbal fixation on action is likewise. Both are preeminently third-person, objective translations of experience that fall short of elucidating the affective-kinetic-cognitional complexities and richness of experience. In the course of everyday life, we – like other forms of animate life – ordinarily think not in terms of purpose or action but in terms of movement: looking for and finding something to eat; writing a letter; waving at a passing friend; driving fast but carefully through traffic; mowing the lawn; standing up to address a meeting; and so on. Purpose is indeed a third-person way of understanding animate movement, a way that fastens on the need to explain or even to justify a mover’s action and that is epitomized in one human querying another: “what is the point of your doing that?”– i.e. “what is your purpose?” In short, to speak of movement in terms of purpose or action puts us at a distance from the very affective-cognitional bodily-kinetic dynamics that are at the heart of animate life, and, in effect, from the meaning that motivates the dynamics and from the meaning the living dynamics generate and articulate.
Among her extensively detailed studies of plovers, ethologist Carolyn Ristau’s article “Before Mindreading: Attention, Purposes and Deception in Birds?” focuses on “broken wing display or ‘injury feigning’” (Ristau 1991: 212). It exemplifies just the kind of thinking that distances us from the living dynamics of animate movement. In the opening sentence of her first section titled “Purposes”, Ristau suggests that “[a] mong those attributes prior to an organism’s having the capacity to attribute intentions in others,. . . the species in question should itself have intentions; its behaviours should be describable in terms of purposes” (ibid: 209). After noting her affirmation of the purposiveness of the plover’s feigning behavior in other research publications, but affirming too that “there are no unassailable criteria connecting observable behaviours to specific accompanying mental states” (ibid), she goes on to describe the behavior:

Fundamental and inherently interrelated aspects of animation 

Broken wing displays are so called because the bird’s appearance very much

resembles one with a broken wing. The full display consists in arching one or both

wings and dragging them, quivering, along the ground. Sometimes the behaviour

is accompanied by a raucous call. Both parents make the display, usually singly,

but occasionally simultaneously. The behaviour occurs on some, but not all

approaches of an intruder toward the region of the eggs or young chicks”.



(ibid: 210)

She subsequently points out that “[i]njury feigning “is among the most intense of a repertoire of anti-predator behaviours” (ibid).
In her following section titled “Deception”, Ristau raises the question of whether, by behaving in such a way, the plover wants the predator or intruder to believe she is injured, and analogously, whether the plover “‘believes she is pretending to have a broken wing’” (ibid: 213). She calls attention to the fact that though a plover may have used the display once with a particular intruder – “‘lured’ it away from the young,” then flown away – the plover will use “the same trick again if the predator return[s].” This evidence, she states, seems to indicate that “the plover could not be attempting to deceive the predator/intruder.” She remarks, however, that “given that the ‘trick’ continues to work, the question must be raised as to the predator’s cognitive abilities. Despite the fact that the predator has observed that the plover flies away ably, it continues to follow the “broken wing displays” (ibid). While acknowledging that her experimental studies with dogs as predators are incomplete, she states: “[T]he plovers which I have observed do not behave in ways that require an interpretation of purposefully ‘deceiving’ the predator/intruder. The cognitive prowess of the intruder must not be assumed to be like that of a human. The broken wing display ‘works’ for the plover; the intruder follows it and gets farther away from the plover’s vulnerable eggs/young” (ibid: 214). After considering gaze and gaze experiments in subsequent sections and urging more studies of the behavior, she concludes:

It is unlikely that ‘injury feigning’ is deceptive in the sense of the plover consciously

pretending to have a broken wing; it is a behaviour at the disposal of the plover.

Using it is pragmatic in getting an intruder away from the region of nest/young.

The behaviour can be construed as deceptive from Mother Nature’s point of view,

i.e. from an evolutionary perspective. Injured animals are selectively preyed

upon by predators. It is adaptive, therefore, for a distractive behaviour to give

an appearance of vulnerability, as the ‘injury feigning’ does. However, it is very

possible that other avian behaviours are deceptive as accumulating evidence

strongly suggests.

(ibid: 221)

Ristau’s description of “the behavior” and her conclusion about it are as problematic as they are significant, and at multiple levels with respect to synergies of meaningful movement. To begin with, the idea that the behavior is not consciously chosen by the plover but is simply at its “disposal” – one behaviour among others in its repertoire – is

 Maxine Sheets-Johnstone
curious. Other avian behaviours may well be deceptive, but that does not make injury ­feigning something other than what it is, namely, and as its label specifically indicates, a pretense behavior. Such behavior articulates a complex kinetic dynamic, precisely as Ristau implicitly indicates: a plover does not normally arch its wings, drag them on the ground, and quiver them as it moves forward – any more than a wolf in the throes of an actual fight normally mutes its bite. In each instance, an intentionality is evident, not in the pragmatic sense of purpose but in the phenomenological sense of meaning. Injury feigning is indeed a synergy of meaningful movements, movements that fall outside the normal and have an intentional scope all their own. Moreover with respect to purpose in a pragmatic sense, i.e. if injury feigning is indeed of practical value, a behavior that effectively distracts intruders or predators from eggs and young, then it cannot be a capricious choice among possible behaviors in the species’ repertoire but is necessarily one that proves itself – and has proved itself – not merely efficacious but meaningful to both plover and intruder, precisely as indicated by the fact that a plover will successfully repeat its injury feigning to the same predator or intruder, and this even if it flies away after its first success. Finally, if “the behavior” is distractive, then there must be something about it that makes it distractive; and further, if its distractiveness is indicative of vulnerability, then clearly there must be something about its nature that gives it the appearance of vulnerability. These latter points direct us straightaway to a more focused consideration of movement and in particular to a more detailed consideration of kinetic dynamics and their affective-cognitive motivations.
3.  Dynamics: At the qualitative heart of synergies of meaningful movement
Human parents who witness their infant flailing its arms and uttering a cry do not wonder what its purpose is, what it is coping with (see further below), or what is going on in its brain. The parents see and hear it as being moved to move, which is to say they see and hear it as being motivated: they do not attend to its flailings or cry as mechanical kinetic phenomena. Indeed, animate beings do not simply move in an ­epiphenomenal sense: they are born to move; they are moved to move; they move meaningfully on behalf of their survival; and some – notably avians and ­mammalians – move meaningfully on behalf of their progeny as well. That humans do not typically look at plovers and other animate forms of life in this way, i.e. morphologically and dynamically in the manner of Darwin rather than mechanically as being driven unconsciously by “Mother Nature”, is not only puzzling but runs against a basic evolutionary fact, notably, “descent with modification”, and hence against an appreciation of evolutionary continuities. As empirically substantiated and discussed elsewhere (Sheets-Johnstone 1999b/expanded 2nd ed. 2011), a kinetic intelligence informs

Fundamental and inherently interrelated aspects of animation 
­animation – all the way “down” to “lower a­ nimals”, e.g. paramecia, amoeba, fan worms. Psychologist Max Velmans substantiates this very point when he notes in more general terms that “continuity in the evolution of consciousness favours continuity in the distribution of consciousness” (Velmans 2007: 280). In short, to adjudge the movement of animate beings mere adaptively pragmatic or mechanical acts is to discredit evolutionary facts of life and, in effect, to deny built-in dynamically lived realities of animation.
When we duly observe animate creatures as the morphological and dynamic forms they are, we cease insisting they prove themselves to us. We give them due and proper credit from the beginning for their natural kinetic/proprioceptive and ­tactile-kinesthetic capacities. At the most fundamental level, these capacities endow them with surface recognition sensitivities in relation to their surrounding world and with an awareness of their own movement in relation to those sensitivities (­Sheets-Johnstone 1998, 1999b/expanded 2nd ed. 2011). Indeed, animate creatures are not foreigners on this earth but forms of life empowered with all the sensitivities and capacities that their particular animation engenders and implies. Surely when we observe an animal controlling its own bodily movement, as in arching, dragging, and quivering its wings, and when we thus recognize that it is moving both within its morphological capacities for movement and as it sees fit within its situation, we realize that it is thinking intelligently and effectively in movement and is at the same time kinesthetically and/or proprioceptively, i.e. dynamically, attuned to its own movement (Sheets-Johnstone 1999b/expanded 2nd ed. 2011). We realize, in other words, that it is not simply reacting visually, auditorily, or olfactorily in a robotic sense to aspects of its surrounding world, but is quintessentially alive to a world that is in fact never the same from one moment to the next, and in being so alive, is affectively and cognitively attuned to its ever-changing world, and morphologically and dynamically aware of its capacity to move and to move in synergies of meaningful movement in relation to it: in this direction or that, for example, slow or fast, with abandon or cautiously, and so on, and thus notably, in a normal or feigned manner. In sum, it has a kinetic repertoire of possible movements in a changing world and a kinetic intelligence readily cognizant of that changing world, a kinetic intelligence that motivates and informs its movement (Sheets-Johnstone 1998; 1999b/expanded 2nd ed. 2011).
In conjunction with a recognition of that intelligence, we should note that when essential realities of evolutionary biology and corollary realities of animate life are overtaken by “theories of mind” or by hypothetical reductive neurologies on the order of brain modules, for example, that follow the idea “a place for everything, and everything in its place” – to appropriate the words of 19th century writer Samuel Smiles2 – the
2.  Samuel Smiles wrote these words in his 1875 book Thrift, but Captain Frederick Marryat wrote in his 1842 book Masterman Ready, “In a well-conducted man-of-war . . . everything is

 Maxine Sheets-Johnstone

inherent kinetic dynamics that define animate life disappear from view and along with them, the experientially grounded affective-cognitional-proprioceptive/tactilekinesthetic foundations of those dynamics. Animation is not a theory or ideology: it is a fact of life, the most fundamental and comprehensive fact of life, and a fact in need of assiduous and painstaking examination. Given the unequivocal realities of animation, primatologists Richard Byrne and Andrew Whiten’s comment on nonhuman animal intentionality is odd if not disturbing. They write, “if some animals are capable of attributing intentionality we need to know – perhaps most importantly because it would completely change our standards of ethics as applied to them” (Byrne & Whiten 1991: 140). In truth, such cognitive human concerns and seeming conceits, wrapped up as they are in justifying theory – and more recently in privilegings of the human brain – are impediments to the achievement of a bona fide evolutionary ethics (cf. Sheets-Johnstone 2008). Indeed, the concern to know in some experimentallydevised empirical way whether a nonhuman animal is “attributing intentionality” and knows what it is doing overlooks the fact that, like we humans, nonhuman animals experience their particular Umwelt (von Uexküll 1928), other individuals and their movement within it.3 We would do well in this context to recall Darwin’s comment regarding insects in general and ants in particular, a comment based not on theory or ideology, but on observation:

It is certain that there may be extraordinary mental activity with an extremely

small absolute mass of nervous matter: thus the wonderfully diversified instincts,

mental powers, and affections of ants are generally known, yet their cerebral

ganglia are not so large as the quarter of a small pin’s head .… the brain of an

ant is one of the most marvellous atoms of matter in the world, perhaps more

The “real-life”, “real-time” (to use dynamic systems language)4 kinetic dynamics of animation can be analyzed in concrete ways: we can bring the dynamics to selfevidence because they are experientially evident, in others as in ourselves. To highlight this fact and appreciate its far-reaching significance, consider first neurophysiologists Barbara Gowitzke and Morris Milner’s (1988) remarks concerning voluntary movement in their chapter on “The Proprioceptors and Their Associated Reflexes”, a chapter in The Scientific Bases of Human Movement. After acknowledging that

“[v]oluntary movement requires a foundation of automatic responses which assure a proper combination of mobility and stability of body parts”, they state: “The voluntary contribution to movement is almost entirely limited to initiation, regulation of speed, force, range, and direction, and termination of the movement” (Gowitzke & Milner 1988: 256). Granted their focus is on neurophysiology, the seemingly minor role attributed to volition is nonetheless astonishing: “limitations” are not only integral to the very nature of voluntary movement but of indisputably sizable import to the mover. A phenomenological analysis of movement sets forth the spatio-temporalenergic structures that constitute the qualitative dynamics of movement and in so doing implicitly demonstrates the experiential import of the “voluntary contribution” (Sheets-Johnstone 1966; 1999b/expanded 2nd ed. 2011). What will become evident through a summary of that analysis is not just a realization of the complex qualitative structure of movement, but seminal realizations of received ignorance about movement that deflect us from an awareness of its qualitative structure, or, in other words, that awaken us to an awareness of what movement is not. It should be noted that the charge of received ignorance is meant pejoratively not toward individuals but toward habits of thought that pass for received wisdom. In particular, it is meant to call attention to the habit of not questioning common understandings of movement and common ways of thinking about movement, understandings and ways that fail to recognize much less capture the dynamics of the phenomenon and that indeed perseverate misconceptions about the very foundation of animate life.
Four primary qualities – tensional, linear, areal, and projectional qualities – are apparent in any movement we make (Sheets-Johnstone 1966 [1979/1980]; 1999b/ expanded 2nd ed. 2011). These qualities are inherent in movement. They define the spatial, temporal, and energic qualities of movement, none of which exists separately but each of which can be spelled out analytically in finer detail. Their particular character in any movement is created by the movement itself. Suppose, for example, that we are trudging up a steep hill: our bodies may be bent forward, our steps may be small, slow, and effortful but at the same time even-paced and smooth. Tensional ­quality defines the intensity of our movement, the effort or force we experience in trudging upward. As with any quality of movement, the tensional quality may vary in the course of our moving: we spontaneously move with less effort as the incline decreases, for example. The linear quality of our movement has two components: the linear design of our moving bodies and the linear pattern of our movement. As suggested by the trudging character of our walk, the overall linear design of our body is likely inclined diagonally from the hips, thus tilted forward. In terms of the overall bodily direction of our movement, the linear pattern of our walk likely proceeds in a straight line forward, linear pattern specifying the path traced by our movement. We should note, however, that not only do our feet trace out a particular linear pattern, but so also do our arms if we are swinging them forward and back, and further, that if instead of looking

 Maxine Sheets-Johnstone
­continuously down at the ground, we look alternately to one side then the other, or up ahead and then again down, our head would trace yet another linear pattern. Again, it is important to note that qualities may vary. We might, for instance, come up from time to time to a vertical alignment or move sideways to avoid large boulders, and thus change the linear design of our moving bodies or the linear pattern of our movement.
Areal quality, like linear quality, has two components: the areal design of our moving bodies and the areal pattern of our movement. We may be not only tilted forward but hunched over as we trudge forward, for example, but then too, as we come to the top of the hill, we may stretch to the full. In short, the areal design our moving bodies may be anywhere from contractive to expansive. The areal pattern of movement may be correlatively anywhere from intensive to extensive. Small, trudging steps make the areal pattern of our movement intensive; large, striding steps make it extensive. Amplitude is clearly a spatial dimension of any movement and areal quality specifies amplitude in terms of both the moving body and movement itself.
Projectional quality describes the manner in which effort or force is manifest: basically in an abrupt, sustained, or ballistic manner. In trudging up a steep hill, we ordinarily move in a sustained manner, plodding upward in an even, smooth gait. But we might also move sharply, for instance, in avoiding an unexpected overhanging branch or begin swinging our arms in a ballistic manner, i.e. with an initial impulse that carries the movement forward and back through its initially generated momentum. Our movement may indeed be a combination of different projectional qualities.
As the above quite summary analysis indicates, the qualitative structure of any movement generates a particular dynamic, a dynamic that itself has a particular quality or constellation of qualities: it flows forth with a certain kinetic energy that may rise and fall in intensity, waxing and waning at the same time spatializing and temporalizing itself in ways that contour the dynamic, making it explosive, attenuated, smooth, jagged, restrained, impulsive, magnified, narrowed, and so on, and in any combination thereof. In short, the qualitative nature of any particular dynamic is formally created by the qualities of movement itself.
It is notable, then, that contrary to the dictionary definition of movement and to popular thought, movement is not “a change of position”. To begin with, movement does not have a “position”, so it cannot possibly change it. Furthermore, we clearly improperly define ourselves-in-movement as “changing position”. While in moving about in our everyday world – in writing our name, washing our face, sweeping the floor, or getting into a car – we indeed change “positions”, we do so only from a thirdperson, analytical, object-in-motion perspective. We ourselves are involved not in anonymous happenings taking place between two – or even more – different positions as we move in distinctive and innumerable ways throughout the day, but in rich and complex qualitative kinetic dynamics. In the course of everyday life, our dynamics are in fact commonly familiar, which is what allows them to flow forth effortlessly in the

Fundamental and inherently interrelated aspects of animation 
sense that we do not have to concentrate attention on our movement. Our familiar dynamics are in the background; they are not, however, on that account outside consciousness (Sheets-Johnstone 2003; 2006; 2011; forthcoming 2012). While we recognize familiar dynamics in the form of style in others – the way a person walks, laughs, and drives, for example – we do not commonly focus on the character or style of our own dynamics. Yet we have all developed habits of moving in the course of learning our bodies and learning to move ourselves, ways of moving that are at bottom coordinated dynamic patterns that run off in consistent ways and that, being familiar and easily carried out, are commonly experienced at the margins of awareness as we focally attend to other things (Sheets-Johnstone 1999b/expanded 2nd ed. 2011; 2011). Habitual movement patterns can, however, be made focally present: we can become aware of the dynamics of brushing our teeth, for example. In fact, were someone else to brush our teeth, we would immediately recognize that someone else was brushing our teeth, not just because we were not holding the tooth brush, and not only because we could actually see someone in front of us holding and moving our toothbrush, but because we would feel a foreign dynamics inside our mouth. In short, when we turn attention to habitual movement patterns, to our own coordinated dynamics (Kelso 1995), we recognize kinesthetic melodies (Luria 1966; 1973; see further below); they bear the recognizable stamp of our own qualitatively felt movement patterns, our own familiar coordination dynamics, our own familiar synergies of meaningful movement.
That movement is “a change of position” is only one piece of received ignorance about movement. A further piece concerns space and time, notably, the belief or adage that movement takes place in space and in time. From a purely objective point of view, we have no quarrel with the claim and thus no difficulty assenting to its truth. But purely objective conceptions of movement belie its experiential realities, which, as even an abbreviated phenomenological analysis shows, constitute a rich and complex qualitative spatio-temporal kinetic dynamic created by movement itself. Interestingly enough, the notion of movement taking place in space and in time is conceptually tied to the dictionary definition of movement as “a change of position” (cf. Zlatev, Blomberg & Magnusson this volume). In fact, given that definition, it is no surprise that movement is conceived as taking place in space and in time. After all, one can chart objects in motion: they go from a certain place here to a certain place there over a certain period of time, much as an airplane flies from New York to London, or as we see someone slip and fall. As the phenomenological analysis makes clear, however, movement differs from objects in motion in creating its own time and space and in thereby creating a particular spatio-temporal kinetic qualitative dynamic. We might all the same readily observe objects in motion as having a particular dynamic, as when we see a plane flying smoothly across the sky, or diving down swiftly, or circling ponderously overhead, or climbing slowly, our attention being diverted precisely from an object changing position and moving in space and in time to movement itself. We might

 Maxine Sheets-Johnstone
furthermore pay attention to our own moving body as an object in motion, attending to its dynamics from a third-person viewpoint, as when we are learning a new skill – how to serve in tennis, how to make a surgical abdominal incision, how to articulate words in a foreign language. In regarding ourselves and parts of ourselves as objects in motion, we experience ourselves – and conceive and speak of our moving bodies – in terms of the speed, range, force, and direction of movement, of initiating this movement “now” at this moment, and of terminating this movement “now” at this moment. We readily take up the objective vocabulary of Gowitzke and Miller. When we observe our own movement in this way, we precisely perceive it, perceive it as a force or effort put forth in time and in space, a force or effort we are controlling or trying to control every step of the way. We do not feel our movement as an unfolding dynamic, a kinetic form-in-the-making; that is, we are not kinesthetically aware of the flowing qualitative spatio-temporal kinetic dynamics of movement.
The difference between experiencing the dynamics of movement itself and those of an object in motion is well exemplified, even epitomized, by an experience most Western adults have had at some time in the course of their lives. When a fully blown balloon is purposefully untied and allowed to splutter about, it creates a particular qualitative kinetic dynamic. While the balloon is clearly an object in motion, what we experience in attending to what we verbally label “spluttering” is a vigorous, erratic, highly punctuated, wholly capricious flow of movement that ends in a sudden collapsing stillness. What captures our attention and is at the heart of our experience is movement, not a balloon in motion. In effect, we have a felt sense of a qualitative kinetic dynamic.
A third piece of received ignorance about movement lurks within the distinction between movement and objects in motion (for further analysis of the distinction, see Sheets-Johnstone 1979). That third piece may in fact be already apparent in the distinction drawn between perceiving one’s movement as an objective happening and feeling one’s movement as a qualitative kinetic dynamic – what famed neuropsychologist Aleksandr Luria in his studies of “the working brain” termed “integral kinaesthetic structures or kinetic melodies” and which he described in painstaking detail (Luria 1973: 176). Contrary to the way in which people commonly speak and write of the experience of movement, we do not have sensations of movement. We do not experience movement in the way we experience a twitch or an itch, a darting pain, a flash of light, a chill, or a peppery taste. As I have pointed out elsewhere, sensations are temporally punctual and spatially pointillist phenomena (Sheets-Johnstone 2003; 2005; 2006). They are discrete bodily-sensed events, momentary here-now bodily experiences.5 In light of the experiential nature of sensations, the problem with “­ kinesthetic
5.  Sensations may, however, in some instances coalesce to form either a kinetic perception or an affective feeling; see Sheets-Johnstone (2006: 366–367).

Fundamental and inherently interrelated aspects of animation 
sensations” becomes obvious. We do not experience our everyday movement – reaching for a glass, opening our arms to hug a friend, and so on, movements that are indeed voluntary – as a series of discrete moment-by-moment, place-by-place kinetic happenings, now-here, now-here kinetic events. What we experience is the kinesthetic feeling of a qualitative kinetic dynamic. As we have seen, the experience of that dynamic is amenable to phenomenological analysis, that is, it can be formally elucidated. Moreover, as we will proceed to show, it can be shown to coincide formally with emotions, with feelings in an affective sense.
4.  Dynamic congruency
The bodily nature of emotions has been a subject of controversy as well as interdisciplinary discussion, the controversy and discussion being perhaps most prominently centered on, and exemplified by the writings of William James and Carl Lange on the one hand and the writings of Walter Cannon on the other. The purpose here is not to review aspects of the controversy or the contrasting theses driving it, nor is it to present arguments for sustaining a belief in the bodily nature of emotion to begin with. It is to set forth empirical evidence substantiating the intimate bond between emotions and movement, to point out the concordance of this evidence with the phenomenological analysis of movement, and on these grounds to document the dynamic congruency of emotion and movement (Sheets-Johnstone 1999a). The import of recognizing the dynamic congruency will become apparent not only with respect to the need to recognize animation in the sense of a whole-body dynamic – a dynamic that goes beyond facial expression, for example – but with respect to the need to recognize that talk of ourselves as “embodied” beings distracts from, if not elides altogether the foundational animation that undergirds all facets of our being and thus provides the proper point of departure for examining the full spectrum of our human faculties and dispositions.
It is notable that in his Introduction to The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, Darwin voices concern that his analysis has a sound foundation and in this context calls attention straightaway to infants. He states: “In order to acquire as good a foundation as possible, and to ascertain, independently of common opinion, how far particular movements. . . are really expressive of certain states of the mind, I have found the following means the most serviceable. In the first place, to observe infants; for they exhibit many emotions, as Sir C. Bell remarks, ‘with extraordinary force’; whereas, in after life, some of our expressions ‘cease to have the pure and simple source from which they spring in infancy’” (Darwin 1965 [1872]: 13). The “after life,” adult shift away from the “pure and simple source” of infancy can surely be described as a shift away from the animate body, in more precise terms, as an

 Maxine Sheets-Johnstone
espousal of measured intellect over spontaneous feeling, a definitive predilection for mind over body. A provocative observation made in a panel discussion on “Expression” during a conference on “Emotions Inside Out: 130 Years after Darwin’s The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals” (Ekman, Campos, Davidson & de Waal 2003) aptly captures the muted kinetic character of adult emotion remarked on by both Darwin and Bell. An unidentified audience member comments, “I’ve been so excited by this whole presentation of this session because everybody is coordinated into one unit, but what has fascinated me is the absence of the body below the neck [laughter]” (ibid: 273). He or she goes on to explain: “I was fascinated by hearing the words, by seeing the faces, but I did not see the talking by the fingers, by the hands, by the movement, poise, and pattern of the people that were moving, sitting, or shifting.” He/she then asks “if there is any further matter going on with the body as a Gestalt when you are communicating with your voice and your face” (ibid). Psychologist Paul Ekman responds first by citing the “pioneering work” of David Efron on gestures – what Efron referred to as “emblems”– and comments, “They are the only body language” (ibid: 273). He mentions Efron’s specification of “speech illustrator movements”, and then alludes to his own research on “bodily movements that we called self-manipulative movements,” movements such as playing with one’s hands or scratching one’s face (ibid: 274). He concludes his response by stating, “There are other approaches that aren’t looking in this formalistic way, but are looking at the flow, or quality, of movement,” and goes on to remark, “These are people who primarily come out of dance. It doesn’t appear that these body movements are as direct a signal source for emotion, in humans at least, as the face and voice. That’s why we couldn’t have found someone able to give a scientific talk on the body movements of emotion” (ibid).
The “absence of the body below the neck” might well be characterized as a chronic metaphysics of absence in “scientific talk on the body movements of emotion”, and the absence of “flow, or quality, of movement” as a chronic absence of both dynamics and first-person experience in “scientific talk on the body movements of emotion.” The absences conceal “the pure and simple source” of emotions that infants enjoy, a source that is quintessentially defined by animation and that is not only typically lost in the “after life” of adults but typically unrecognized in the qualitatively blinkered life of most scientists and philosophers if not academic and non-academic people generally. The deficiency of our “after life” and of a blinkered science notwithstanding, we can nonetheless clearly recognize that the absences constitute an absence of whole-body qualitative dynamics. Our voices and faces are part and parcel of those dynamics, part of the qualitative affective-kinetic dynamics created by otherwise spontaneously whole moving bodies. Animate bodies are indeed ones from which movement flows, and in flowing, creates a qualitative dynamic that, as we have seen, can be elucidated in fine phenomenological detail, a detailing that in truth is far

Fundamental and inherently interrelated aspects of animation 

more kinetically elucidating and exacting than scientific disquisitions on emblematic gestures, illustrator movements, and self-manipulative movement. It is pertinent to recall in this regard that phenomenological analyses are open to verification within a methodology no less demanding than that of Western science, which means they can be brought to self-evidence by anyone caring to examine experience. Emotions do indeed “spring” from the body and in their own distinctive qualitative kinetic dynamics as both Darwin and Bell demonstrate graphically as well as descriptively (Darwin 1965 [1872]; Bell 1844). Infant psychiatrist and clinical psychologist Daniel Stern aptly terms these kinetically-charged affective dynamics “vitality affects” (Stern 1985; 1993). Obviously, to appreciate them, we need to regain touch with our primordial animation by affectively and kinetically interrogating our “after life” as adults.
In “Concluding Remarks and Summary”, his final chapter on the expression of emotions, Darwin emphasizes “the intimate relation which exists between almost all the emotions and their outward manifestations” (Darwin 1965 [1872]: 365). Indeed, both implicitly and explicitly throughout his text he has validated the intimate bond. With respect to rage, for example, he observes:

[R]espiration is laboured, the chest heaves, and the dilated nostrils quiver. The

whole body often trembles. The voice is affected. The teeth are clenched or

ground together, and the muscular system is commonly stimulated to violent,

almost frantic action. But the gestures of a man in this state usually differ from

the purposeless writhings and struggles of one suffering from an agony of pain;

for they represent more or less plainly the act of striking or fighting with an

enemy.

(ibid: 74)

Even as concerns speech, he observes, “The movements of expression give vividness and energy to our spoken words. They reveal the thoughts and intentions of others more truly than do words, which may be falsified” (ibid: 364)
Darwin’s observations on the intimate bond between movement and emotion are consonant with the lifelong experimental studies of medical doctor and neuropsychiatrist Edmund Jacobson, who developed and honed a form of introspection that he called “auto-sensory observation”.6 The introspectional practice allowed patients to monitor and ultimately dissipate excessive, unproductive bodily tensions and in consequence to decrease their anxieties and other debilitating feelings. The selfobservational technique centers essentially on tactile-kinesthetic awarenesses of one’s

6.  For a more detailed exposition of the work of Jacobson and of the work of Bull and of de Rivera that follow, see Sheets-Johnstone (1999a).

 Maxine Sheets-Johnstone

specific and overall tensional levels. Of seminal interest is Jacobson’s description of the holistic nature of a trained observer’s awareness. He states:

The trained observer (not the tyro) identifies and locates signals of neuromuscular

activity as integral parts of the mental act [of ‘attention, imagination, recall,

fantasy, emotion, or any other mental phenomena’]. He does not discern two acts,

one ­so-called ‘mental’ and the other ‘neuromuscular’, but one act only.



(Jacobson 1970: 35)

As if prescient of the direction in which his neuropsychiatric profession will go, he comments that “those who would do homage to the brain with its ten billion cellamplifiers can well continue to do so,” but they must also not overlook empirical evidence: that “muscles and brain proceed together in one effort-circuit, active or relaxed” (ibid: 36, 34). Jacobson’s empirical evidence of a singular muscle-brain ‘effort-circuit’ accords with Darwin’s basic insight that movement and emotion go hand in hand.
The innovative research of psychiatrist Nina Bull delineates the intimate bond in further, strikingly revealing experiential ways that demonstrate to begin with that there is a generative as well as expressive dimension inherent in the relation between movement and emotion; that is, “a basic neuromuscular sequence is essential to the production of affect” (Bull 1951: 79). Using a methodology based on hypnosis, Bull elicits reports from subjects experiencing one of six specified emotions: fear, anger, disgust, depression, joy, triumph. With respect to fear, one subject reports, for example: “First my jaws tightened, and then my legs and feet. . . my toes bunched up until it hurt. . . and. . . well, I was just afraid of something” (ibid: 59). With respect to anger, subjects report “wanting to throw, pound, tear, smash and hit” and what restrains them, Bull reports, is “always the same, clenching the hands” or making some similar restraining movement (ibid: 65). Of particular interest is her locking subjects hypnotically into a particular emotion – the subjects were first read a particular description from their own experiential reports and told to adopt the specific bodily attitude they themselves had described – and were to remain in that locked position until specifically unlocked. Without unlocking them, however, Bull told the subjects they were to feel an entirely different, contrasting emotion. That they were unable to do so is indicative of the fact that a change in affect requires a change in postural tensions and general bodily attitude. As one subject responded: “I reached for joy – but couldn’t get it–so tense”; another responded: “I feel light – can’t feel depression” (ibid: 84, 85). What Bull’s generative study shows indisputably is that affective and tactile-kinesthetic feelings are experientially intertwined. Moreover that subjects did not distinguish between the two feelings is testimony to the fact that they are experienced holistically and integrally, not as causally sequenced phenomena.
Further empirical evidence of the intimate bond is set forth by psychologist Joseph de Rivera in his “geometry of emotions,” which shows that emotions move

Fundamental and inherently interrelated aspects of animation 
us, “transforming” our relation to the world (de Rivera 1977: 35). In delineating “The Movements of the Emotions,” de Rivera singles out and illustrates four fundamental kinetic-affective relations, that is, four basic modes of bodily extension and c­ ontraction with respect to four basic emotions: anger, fear, affection, and desire. “If the arms are held out in a circle so that the fingertips almost touch, they may either be brought toward the body (a movement of contraction) or moved out in extension. The entire trunk may follow these movements” (and so, we should add, might also one’s legs and thus one’s whole body). De Rivera then states that “if the palms are facing in, the extension movement corresponds to a moving toward the other – a giving – as in tenderness, while the contraction movement suggests a movement toward the self – a getting – as in longing. If the palms are rotated out, the extension movement corresponds to the thrusting against of anger, while the contraction intimates the withdrawal away of fear.” He points out: “If one allows oneself to become involved in the movement and imagines an object, one may experience the corresponding emotion” (ibid: 40).
De Rivera actually elaborates a complex structure of emotions based on these “four basic emotional movements” (ibid: 41). In addition to demonstrating the intimate bond between movement and emotion, the further point of moment here is precisely the basic one of an animated subject-world relationship: de Rivera demonstrates kinetically that emotions resolve themselves dynamically into extensional or contractive movements that go either toward, against, or away from something in one’s surrounding world and correlatively away from or toward oneself. In sum, and as the previously cited research studies from Darwin onward show, emotions are affectivelycharged kinetic forms of the tactile-kinesthetic body. To appreciate the dynamic congruency of emotions and movement thus requires recognition of a holistic whole-body qualitative dynamics.
5.  Semantic congruency and dynamic congruency: Cornerstones of animation
As we have seen, animate beings are not objects in motion but subjects of a world who move in distinctive morphological and qualitatively dynamic ways and who initiate and terminate their own movement. Regarded as objects in motion, their innate and fundamental animateness goes unrecognized; their subject-world relationship is annulled. In consequence, fundamental concepts generated in and through the experience of moving oneself, corporeal concepts (Sheets-Johnstone 1990; 1999b/expanded 2nd ed. 2011), go unrecognized. However stark their difference in kinetic form and evolutionary heritage, the Tanzsprache of a honeybee, for example, and the coordinated hunting manoeuvres of two lionesses testify equally to corporeal concepts, that is, to the empirical reality of nonlinguistic concepts in animate life (Sheets-Johnstone 1990; 2010). It is thus not just

 Maxine Sheets-Johnstone
the everyday movements of humans but the everyday m­ ovements of animate creatures as a whole that are generative of concepts, concepts that are tied to specific morphologies and ways of life, that are integral to survival and, with respect to social animals, to social communication. In short, fundamental c­ oncepts of space, time, and force – of distance, direction, tempo, duration, effort, and so on – o­ riginate in self-movement. In effect – and to use human examples for ­brevity’s sake (see S­ heets-Johnstone 1990; 2010, 2011 and further below for examples of and references to nonhuman animals) – it is not just that everyday human movements such as reaching and grasping, standing and sitting, pushing and pulling, bending and stretching, and so on, are dependent on, and a measure of, human movement capabilities and dispositions, but that they are and have been from the beginning generative of concepts: of near and far, up and down, weak and strong, straight and curved, slow and fast, abrupt and attenuated. As shown at length in earlier analyses of thinking and of the primacy of movement (­Sheets-Johnstone 1990; 1999b/expanded 2nd ed. 2011), cognition is not separate from perception, perception from movement, nor movement from an environment or surrounding world. These inherently inter-related aspects of animation commonly pass unnoticed in talk of “behavior”: they constitute the complex and often subtle whole of any actual “real-time,” “real-life” self-movement as it unfolds. Synergies of meaningful movement are indeed consistently informed by spatio-temporal-energic concepts.
Ethological studies utilizing a movement analysis system7– John Fentress’s studies of mice (Fentress 1989), for example, and Moran, Fentress, and Golani’s studies of ritualized fighting in wolves (Moran, Fentress & Golani 1981) – readily demonstrate the far richer significance of analyzing and understanding the kinetic dynamics of animal movement over standard reports of animal behavior precisely because they distinguish and specify the spatial, temporal, and energic complexities of everyday animate life. In doing so, they provide gateways to understanding synergies of meaningful movement in the animate world. Neurophysiologist Gerald Edelman’s experimental studies of automatons, particularly “Darwin III” that demonstrates how cognitive determinations of an object are based on freely-varied movement (Edelman 1992: 93), implicitly underscore a further dimension of that richer significance, namely, that animation is first and foremost a subject-world relationship and being such is naturally an integrated affective-kinetic-cognitive phenomenon: animate beings are impelled to move on the basis of their interest in, or aversion to, what they perceive, what they recognize, and so on, and in turn, to move in ways semantically congruent with their experience. Finally,

the meticulously detailed analyses of the relationship of movement to perception set forth in methodologically different but highly complementary ways by Edmund ­Husserl and Hermann von Helmholtz (see Sheets-Johnstone 1999b/expanded 2nd ed. 2011) show indisputably that the relationship, far from being a matter of “behavior,” is a movement-perceptual-cognitional relationship motivated by and articulated within an affective framework of some kind: interest, curiosity, or play, for instance.
The above-cited analyses, observations, field studies, and experimental programs point to the need to recognize the multi-faceted realities of animation, and correlatively to recognize not only that behavior is not en par with animation, but that conceiving cognition or affectivity a “state” of the organism is as misguided as conceiving movement a “motor” phenomenon. The two misconceptions are in fact not distant from each other: in the one instance, there is an inattention to dynamics; in the other, an inattention to kinesthesia and proprioception. The inattentions are conceptually akin to the three pieces of received ignorance discussed earlier and impediments in their own right to a recognition of the foundational reality of animation. For these reasons and because they pervade diverse current literatures, they warrant finer specification.
The inattention to dynamics is not relieved by the all-encompassing lexical band-aid of “embodiment” (e.g. “embodied experience”, “embodied metaphor”, Gibbs 2006; “embodied self-awareness”, Zahavi 2002; “embodied subjectivity”, Hanna & ­Thompson 2003; Zahavi 2005) or what might be considered its Heideggerian-spawned existential surrogate, “coping” (e.g. Dreyfus & Spinosa 1999; Dreyfus 2000; see further below). Correlatively, the inattention to kinesthesia and proprioception is not relieved by the variable lexical band-aids of “enaction” (Varela, Thompson, & Rosch 1991), “neurophenomenology” (Varela 1999a; 1999b), “sensorimotor ­subjectivity” (Thompson 2007), and the like. That meaningful ways of moving are meaningfully motivated – finding something noxious and moving away from it, for example – can hardly be denied: life-enhancing capacities and dispositions are foundational to animate life. In light of this evolutionary fact of life, it is astonishing if not regrettable that the living dynamics of affectivity and cognition are sidelined in presentday pursuits of a consummate cognitive neuroscience of the brain and that they are unthinkingly and no less emphatically marginalized when parsed as it were and treated under the aegis of “coping” behavior (Varela 1999a; 1999b; Varela & Depraz 2005; Thompson 2007). In the former circumstance, dynamics are commonly sacrificed to a microphrenology intent on spatializing functions and even experience by giving them discrete locations in the brain, precisely as in hypothetical brain modules and in experimentally located mirror neurons. Certainly neuroscientific studies of the brain are of value, and indeed, instrumental in understanding pathologies and in treating pathologically impaired individuals. However, as noted neuropsychologist Roger Sperry long ago affirmed on the basis of his studies of its neurophysiology, the brain is an organ of and for movement that functions as an integrated whole on behalf of a “preparation to

 Maxine Sheets-Johnstone
respond” (Sperry 1952: 301), that is, on behalf of what biologists term a defining feature of life: responsivity (Curtis 1975). As such, the brain is a dynamic organ. Research studies in coordination dynamics address the brain in just such terms, producing findings that show it works in both localized and integrated ways (Kelso & Engstrøm 2006). The field of coordination dynamics, an elemental and critically significant domain within dynamic systems research, in fact aims not at reductionism but at an illumination of the complementary nature of Nature, indeed, the complementary nature of brain and behavior as complex dynamic systems (Kelso 1995; Kelso & Engstrøm 2006): “In coordination dynamics, the real-life coordination of neurons in the brain and the real-life coordinated actions of animals are cut, fundamentally, from the same dynamic cloth. Integrity is in turn preserved because it is never threatened. Psychophysical unity is undergirded at all levels by coordination dynamics” (Sheets-Johnstone 2004; quoted in Kelso & Engstrøm 2006: 9). Coordination dynamics is thus not just a necessary but a foundational correction to reductionist microphrenological thinking.
In the latter circumstance – that of “coping” behavior – coping is taken as the basic landscape on which emotion “occurs,” ostensibly because, as Varela describes it, coping defines a break in transparency, that is, a break in our “unreflected absorption” in the world as we go about our everyday business – of “hammering,” for instance, as in Heidegger’s classic example (Heidegger 1962: 98), the example taken up by Varela (Varela 1999a: 299). “This standard Heideggerian vignette,” Varela avers, “can be extended to all embodied actions, that is, actions in a fluid context where there is always a mixture of immediate coping and concurrent secondary activities of l­anguage and mental life” (ibid.). Whatever might be the specified meaning of “embodied actions”– the idea of disembodied ones is difficult to imagine – coping is attributed to all human actions “in a fluid context,” which means along with hammering not only reaching, pushing, throwing, walking, greeting, and so on, all of which take place in a literally fluid context, i.e. in movement, but gasping, moaning, laughing, and even whistling: all are “embodied actions” within our “unreflected absorption” in the world. The idea that emotion is simply an “affective tonality” concomitant with a break in our absorption, in essence that emotion and coping are existential bedfellows, the break precipitating an emotion of some kind – “fear, jealousy, anger, anxiety, self-assurance, and so on” (ibid: 299–230) –8 deprives emotion of its living dynamics. Elation is not an epiphenomenon of coping; neither are disappointment,
8.  “The loss of transparency is never distant from a dispositional affective tone . . . and that different degrees of breakdown in transparency and the multiple manners in which it happens opens a panoply of affective tonalities: fear, jealousy, anger, anxiety, self-assurance, and so on. Accordingly, the word ‘emotion’ is used here in its specific sense: the tonality of the affect that accompanies a shift in transparency. Affect, on the other hand, is a broader dispositional orientation which will precondition the emotional tone that may appear” (Varela 1999a: 299–300; italics in original).

pride, delight, jealousy, or grief. Whatever the emotion, it has its own affectively-felt dynamic contours. “Coping” removes these dynamics from view. It focuses attention on what to do about the break: when “the hammer slips and lands on the finger”, for example, “[the] breakdown brings the transparent equipment into view, and a new set of action-assessments begins” (ibid: 299). Philosopher Evan Thompson focuses on emotion in ways similar to Varela in exploring “the link between emotion and the protentional aspects of temporality”. Thus, he too distances himself from a recognition of the inherently distinctive qualitative dynamics of emotion. Analyzing emotion in terms of “an action tendency or readiness for action” and of “skillful coping” (Thompson 2007: 361, 374–375), he validates Varela’s dual leads: on the one hand, “Coping is a readiness or dispositional tendency for action in a larger field, an ontological readiness, that is, an expectation as to the way the world will show up” (Varela 1999b: 132); on the other hand, “The loss of fluidity in coping is never distant from a dispositional affective tone” (ibid).
An equally basic and critical oversight exists on the cognitive side and concerns the fact that “transparency acquisition” (ibid; Varela 1999a: 299) is taken for granted; it is nowhere recognized as the animate engagement with the world that it is, an engagement that has a particular cognitional dynamic. In effect, the very attainment of “transparency”– of familiarity – is nowhere accounted for. It obviously rests on animation, on a kinetic-affective-cognitive engagement with the world such that learning takes place to begin with, the learning that grounds “transparency”. How indeed do “doings” become familiar, so familiar that we are “unreflectively absorbed” in them? The answer is clearly rooted in dynamics, in the qualitative tactile-kinesthetically felt kinetic dynamics of tying a knot, sweeping, brushing one’s teeth, typing, playing a Bach prelude, and so on. Familiar dynamics are woven into our bodies and are played out along the lines of our bodies; they are kinesthetic/kinetic melodies in both a neurological and experiential sense (Luria 1966, 1973).9 In writing one’s name, or pulling out weeds, or skipping down stairs, one’s creation and constitution of a kinesthetic/kinetic melody are phenomenologically concurrent (see S­ heets-Johnstone 1999b/expanded 2nd ed. 2011, Chapter III; 2006: 371ff.). The melody is kinesthetically felt and has a cognitive aura generated in and by the very movement that produces it at the same time that the very movement that produces it is kinesthetically and cognitively constituted as an ongoing qualitative kinetic dynamic. It has, to paraphrase Stern (Stern 1985; 1993), “vitality cognates” or “vitality cognitive affects”: cognitive-kinetic shifts in momentum, for example, and cognitive-kinetic crescendos
9.  It is worth noting that melodies are to begin with qualitative phenomena, qualitative in virtue of their spatio-temporal-energic character. Varela’s description of his “exaltation” at a concert is testimony to the fundamentally qualitative character of melody and its qualitatively experienced dynamics (Varela & Depraz 2005: 67–68).

and ­diminuendos. Indeed, the qualitative dynamic of a melody might at times be felt not only affectively as rushed, attenuated, awkward, abrupt, delicate, jagged, fluent, and so on, but cognitively as limpid, transformable, assured, problematic, flawless, questionable, and so on. All such felt cognitive-kinetic qualities enter into the overall dynamic, the cognitive tonalities of the melody modulating the kinetic patterning throughout and the kinetic patterning modulating the cognitive tonalities throughout. It is surely clear then that familiar dynamics are not embodied; like emotion and movement, they are through and through already a bodily phenomenon. They are preeminently cognitive forms of animation.
The dynamics of cognition and affectivity involve us in the world, which means they animate us and are foundational to our being the animate forms we are, leading us to explore, to doubt, to fear, to come to know, to wonder, to delight, and so on. J.A. Scott Kelso’s pivotal and extensive work in coordination dynamics readily exemplifies not only the foundational import of dynamics, but the dynamic concordance of affectivity and cognition – what he later terms their “complementary nature” (Kelso & Engstrøm 2006). In the course of wondering how to demonstrate spontaneously selforganizing dynamic patternings, Kelso came upon spontaneous phase transitions. His account warrants full quotation, for his discovery actually reveals two different but intertwined spontaneous phase transitions:

It is the winter of 1980 and I’m sitting at my desk in my solitary cubicle late at

night. Suddenly from the dark recesses of the mind an image from an ad for

the Yellow Pages crops up: ‘Let your fingers do the walking’. To my amazement

I was able to create a ‘quadruped’ composed of the index and middle fingers of

each hand. By alternating the fingers of my hands and synchronizing the middle

and index fingers between my hands, I was able to generate a ‘gait’ that shifted

involuntarily to another ‘gait’ when the overall motion was speeded up.… On

hindsight, the emergence of this idea was itself a kind of phase transition.



(Kelso 1995: 46)

The idea of letting his fingers do the walking was a spontaneous breakthrough into a new mode of thinking about spontaneously self-organized movement. It was, in other words, an ideational phase transition that aptly and finely exemplifies t­hinking in movement (Sheets-Johnstone 1981; 1999b/expanded 2nd ed. 2011; see also ­Sheets-Johnstone 2004; 2011). The result of such thinking eventuated for Kelso in a sophisticated cognitive achievement. At the most fundamental level, cognitive achievements are consistently the result of thinking in movement, that is, the result of what Husserl and von Helmholtz are both at pains to describe in relation to the integral connection of movement and perception and what Edelman’s Darwin III experiments exemplify. Synergies of meaningful movement are thus experienced not only in everyday animate life, but in ideational pursuits, in highly sophisticated cognitive ventures and achievements.

Fundamental and inherently interrelated aspects of animation 
Affectivity and cognition are dynamic phenomena in a historical sense as well. It is readily evident that we mature affectively over the course of our lives – or at least have the possibility of maturing affectively over the course of our lives – and that we mature cognitively, most significantly in learning our bodies and learning to move ourselves to begin with (Sheets-Johnstone 1999b/expanded 2nd ed. 2011). That ­affectivity and cognition are naturally developing and evolving phenomena in animate forms of life is not commonly acknowledged. Evidence presented in support of the fundamental and allembracing reality of animation, however, shows clearly that the realities of morphology and dynamics exist not in a privileged human vacuum but across animate life generally.
With respect to the reduction of movement to a motorology and the corollary omission of kinesthesia and proprioception, we may briefly and straightaway note the ubiquitousness of the reductionist practice. It is not just neurophysiologists who write of motor behavior, motor control, motor learning, motor skills, and so on, but philosophers, psychologists, psychiatrists, anthropologists, linguists – people in virtually all academic disciplines, though likely excluding altogether the department of dance, which, as Ekman reminds us with respect to the lack of research on emotions below the neck, is concerned with flow and quality. In short, motorology is a rampant and conceptually pernicious orthodoxy bordering on an unexamined idée fixe. (See for example, Donald 2000: 105–109 on “The Primacy of Motor Evolution”; MerleauPonty 1962 on “motor intentionality”). Contrary to being puppets in a motorology drama, animate beings in their everyday lives create particular movement dynamics and straightaway know kinesthetically and/or proprioceptively that kinetic dynamic and its possible variations. Not only a slip of the hammer but a slip of the tongue discloses an unfamiliar dynamic, a lapse in semantic congruency, a lapse in an everyday synergy of meaningful movement. Indeed, human tongues are waggable, not in the same way that dogs’ tails are waggable – human tongues are waggable in far more complex ways, including being mis-waggable and disingenuously waggable – but their dynamic patternings, their synergies of meaningful movement, are articulations on par with comsigns in the animate world at large: synergies of meaningful movement articulate “signs”– including signs in the form of words – that virtually all in the species are capable of performing and understanding.
In sum, dynamic congruency and semantic congruency are integrally linked. In the context of insisting on reference over meaning, philosopher Hilary Putnam exclaimed, “meaning ain’t in the head.” Indeed, it is not in the head: it is in moving bodies. Meanings are constituted; they involve a putting together in which “the kinestheses” (Husserl e.g. 1970; 1980; 1989) are paramount, and paramount affectively as well as perceptually, conceptually as well as environmentally, which is why synergies of meaningful movement anchor our animate presence in the world. They are what learning our bodies and learning to move ourselves are all about. They are what survival is all about. They are what social communication is all about.

Could moving ourselves be the link between emotion and consciousness?
Ralph D. Ellis & Natika Newton

The idea that emotion is an indispensable ingredient of consciousness in all modalities is not new. Panksepp and Damasio, for example, show that we can gradually eliminate cortical areas without eliminating “core consciousness,” whereas knocking out emotional areas renders all types of consciousness impossible. However, opponents insist that “emotional” areas also release neurotransmitters to the cortex having nothing to do with emotion, and are merely necessary in the way that electrical current is necessary for a radio. They insist that the radio (the cortex) is what makes the music (consciousness). The subcortex is only a way to get power to the radio.
What is needed is a coherent story about the specific way in which emotion grounds other conscious states. We suggest that the brain activities involved in self-initiated action subserve consciousness, and that these action-initiating circuits are crucially dependent on motivational processes. The emotional system sets up a three-way connection between motivation, action, and consciousness. To elucidate this connection, we focus here on evidence from event related potential (ERP) studies, perceptual priming studies (e.g. inattentional blindness), motor imagery research, the role of the “mirror neuron” system in understanding others’ actions, and electrodes that access action commands in the brains of animals, allowing them to move computer cursors with their minds. Thus, we argue that consciousness can occur only in beings that can initiate motivated action, that action commands create action imagery covertly as well as overtly, and that action imagery allows conscious representation of action affordances of objects.

1.  Introduction
Much of the recently renewed interest in the relationship between consciousness and emotion is inspired by the idea that emotion may play a central role in all consciousness, not just in emotional feeling states themselves. Emotion itself may be defined

 Ralph D. Ellis & Natika Newton
without reference to consciousness, as a system that motivates the organism to act in certain ways (e.g. Damasio 2003; Ellis 2005). Thus emotion could constitute one of the crucial ingredients of all conscious processes if the difference between conscious and non-conscious information processing hinges on the role of emotion in motivating action commands in terms of which the action affordances of environmental situations can be understood (Newton 1982; 1993; 1996; Ellis 1986; 1995; 2005; Ciompi & Panksepp 2005). Emotions, while not necessarily conscious per se, would then be one of the building blocks of consciousness because consciousness requires (among other things) a capacity for motivated action. Digital computers and our current (nonliving) robots, on this analysis, may process information, yet are not conscious because they are not capable of motivated action. At the same time, motivated action by itself is not necessarily conscious, for reasons that are complicated and will be discussed below.
The thesis that the lack of motivation for action is the reason emotionless entities like computers cannot have consciousness brings together two loosely interconnected traditions. Some consciousness theorists, dubbed “enactivists” by Varela et al. (1991), have emphasized the importance of action as a necessary grounding of consciousness, but without stressing that the difference between action and mere reaction is interconnected with the difference that emotion makes. This tradition includes Neisser (1976), James and Eleanor Gibson (see E.J. Gibson 1988), Clark (1997), Gallagher (2005), Humphrey (2000), Kelso (1995), Thelen and Smith (1994), Thompson (2007), and Varela et al (1991). Others have observed either empirically or phenomenologically the correlations between emotion and consciousness, but without emphasizing as much as the enactivists do the capacity for action as the missing element in non-conscious information processing (e.g. Cytowic 1993; Damasio 1999; Gendlin 1962/1998; Giorgi 1973; Panksepp 2000; Watt 1998). Both traditions have roots in both phenomenology and neurophysiology, and both are prefigured by MerleauPonty (1941, 1942), who was ahead of his time in integrating phenomenological philosophy with neuropsychology.
In our view, both streams are needed. Action cannot be understood without motivation, and the way in which emotion is necessary for consciousness seems to be in terms of its role in motivating actions, which then allow for an understanding of the action affordances of environmental situations.
To suggest that emotion may be necessary for consciousness in this way is not to say that it is a sufficient condition for consciousness. Emotions, actions, and in our view even motor imagery can occur on an unconscious basis.
Nor do we mean to imply that the object of consciousness is necessarily the same as the object of the accompanying emotion. I may be conscious of the texture of a tree bark because I can imagine performing such actions as running my hand over the

bark. Paradoxically, I may not be conscious of my motivation to run my hand over the bark, or even of my motivation to direct attention to the bark’s texture. And I may also be unconscious of the actions that I performed in focusing and redirecting my eyes, and all the other nervous system activities that were necessary to focus attention on the bark. I may not consciously know whether the motivation was a need to orient myself in the environment, or mere curiosity, or a desire to remember the tree under which I professed undying love to a high school sweetheart, or any number of other motives.
Our thesis, then, is that some system of motivations is necessary for an ability to perform actions relative to an object or situation, and that we are conscious of objects and situations by (usually subliminally) imagining how we could act relative to them. The ability to imagine ourselves acting is the difference between us and a passivereceiving system such as an electric eye, which merely registers “perceptual” inputs and then automatically re-acts to those inputs by causing a door to swing open – all without any consciousness. Since we are speaking here of the difference between conscious and non-conscious information processing, we shall confine ourselves in this paper to states of intentional consciousness – states in which there is some real or imaginary object or situation that the consciousness is about or toward which it is directed.
In order to say what we have said so far, we have already used the term “understanding.” We have posited that motivated action is necessary for consciousness because we understand objects and situations by imagining how we could act relative to them, and that we understand the actions in turn by imagining ourselves performing the actions. The sense of “understanding” meant here is the one used by Newton (1996) in distinguishing between conscious information processing and the processing executed by Searle’s “Chinese room,” which merely contains translations of Chinese words and spits out the equivalent words, but without “understanding” Chinese. What the Chinese room is doing is similar to what a digital computer can do, and what the Chinese room is missing is also something that we conscious beings have that distinguishes us from non-conscious information processors. In this sense, “understanding” is closely interrelated to conscious as opposed to non-conscious information processing. Understanding is not equivalent to consciousness, but it plays a role in enabling consciousness.
The relevant sense of “understanding” here also has to do with the fact that the Chinese room cannot act. We understand an action when we can voluntarily execute the action, or at least imagine ourselves doing so. Before that, it is not an action, but only a random movement of an infant’s limbs as they flail around indiscriminately. To understand an action is to be able to form an image of ourselves performing the action that is rich enough to serve as a guide to performing the action. We know that this has

occurred when we can deliberately repeat an action; infants quickly begin learning rudimentary control of some of their actions, notably eye movements, within days of birth. Our hypothesis is that we understand objects by (either consciously or unconsciously) imagining actions that we could execute in relation to them. To be sure, this leaves room for non-conscious understanding, but in our view the converse is not true: there is no intentional consciousness without some kind of understanding (in which we include mis-understanding).
The meaning of “understanding” crucially hinges on the meaning of “imagination.” If understanding an action consists in forming an image of ourselves performing the action that is rich enough to serve as a guide to action, and if understanding can be non-conscious, then certainly the action imagery that subserves it must also be able to occur on an unconscious basis. Moreover, it seems obvious that we do not always consciously imagine actions when being conscious of objects. So in what sense does imagining an action figure into our consciousness of a (real or imaginary) object or situation?
It may initially sound circular to say that imagination of action affordances is required for consciousness of objects, because imagining is traditionally thought of as already a form of consciousness in its own right, and therefore we might be assuming what we purport to be “explaining.” Here again, to avoid circularity requires the notion that the imagining presupposed here can be either conscious or unconscious, and it will usually be the latter.
Avoiding circularity also requires that to imagine an action is not the same thing as imagining an object. We can imagine moving our left foot without imagining some object there to kick. So our thesis is that imagining actions, either consciously or nonconsciously, is a more primitive precondition that is required for being conscious of an object.
That there is unconscious action imagery seems to be a phenomenological observation. A musician often imagines moving the fingers to finger an instrument while listening to music, and is not conscious of having done so until someone calls attention to it. Someone watching a boxing match may unconsciously move the fists, or simply imagine doing so. Those who study the mirror neuron system in the brain (e.g. Gallese et al. 1996; Gallese et al. 1998) show that, when we observe someone else performing an action, parts of the motor cortex activate in the same way as if we were to perform the same movements ourselves. And these activations are also similar to the ones that occur when we consciously imagine performing an action without overtly doing so (Jeannerod 1997). How there can be preconscious or non-conscious action imagery is a more complicated question, and to give a full accounting would be beyond our scope, but we will offer some remarks on this issue and some further examples as we proceed.

Could moving ourselves be the link between emotion and consciousness? 
Another crucial problem to be addressed with regard to unconscious action imagery is whether it refers only to physiological processes that somehow are causally and/ or isomorphically related to a “represented” object, or whether it refers to a more fully developed process that potentially would be conscious if combined with certain other physiological conditions. Action imagery in the former sense would be a very weak sense of the term, and would raise innumerable problems about how to define “imagery” without any reference to an intentional meaning. What we are referring to, by contrast, is a non-conscious state that is mental and intentional even though it may not be conscious. Here again, the musician’s fingering the instrument is more than just an isomorphic physical process in the brain; when the musician’s attention is called to what she is doing, she at least in some cases acknowledges that the action imagery was already there prior to becoming conscious of it.
In this paper, we need to be careful to avoid two additional pitfalls in pursuing the understanding of consciousness in terms of motivated action. On the one hand, there is the danger of under-emphasizing the role of self-movement, by treating emotion as a response to a stimulus input. The danger here is that we lose the distinction between action and mere reaction. If the working hypothesis is that conscious and nonconscious information processing are different because of the role of motivated action in the former, then it is important not to construe motivated action as just another type of reaction. In that case, one would wonder why a motivated organism should be any more conscious than a sophisticated digital computer or a robot that merely receives and transforms information.
On the other hand, there is also a contrary danger. To be sure, we can distinguish self-organizing systems from systems that merely are moved by external forces. Living organisms are capable of action because of their self-organizing structure. But we must also remember that there seem to be self-organizing systems that are capable of generating the structures of their own movement, as opposed to merely reacting to external stimuli, and yet are still not conscious. Traffic patterns, ice crystals, and ecosystems are self-organizing, but probably are not conscious. The same may be true for unicellular organisms or organisms lacking nervous systems. So if we make the mistake of treating self-organized action as a sufficient rather than only a necessary condition for consciousness, then we may end up leaving out the ingredient that distinguishes conscious actors from non-conscious self-organizing systems like ecosystems, traffic patterns, and amoebas.
A classic example of the first danger – a too-passive account of emotional consciousness, with a resulting over-emphasis on passive receiving of interoceptive information – is found in Damasio’s recent work (Damasio 2003). In his description of “feelings,” which consist of conscious awareness of emotions, Damasio states boldly, “My view is that feelings are functionally distinctive because their essence consists of

 Ralph D. Ellis & Natika Newton

the thoughts that represent the body involved in a reactive process” (2003: 86). Further on, he approvingly credits A.D. Craig with

the idea that we are privy to a sense of the body’s interior, an interoceptive

sense. In other words, the very same region that both theoretical proposals and

functional imaging studies relate to feelings turns out to be the recipient of the

class of signals most likely to represent the content of feelings: signals related to

pain states; body temperature....

(Damasio 2003: 106)

For Damasio, feeling an emotion is a result of receiving an interoceptive afferent signal which, he emphasizes, is not different in principle from receiving an afferent signal when perceiving an external object. In both cases, the signal is afferent, which means it travels toward the central nervous system from more remote areas – either the body’s extremities, or the viscera. In Damasio’s account, the conscious feeling results from a receiving of interoceptive information, not from the initiating of an action command. So in his view, introducing feeling and emotion into the traditional perceptual model of consciousness adds no further participation on the part of the subject, who still remains a passive recipient of interoceptive signals. This view, then, provides no account of how conscious information processing is different from a robot’s passive receiving of inputs and then transforming them into behavioral outputs.
On the contrary, the notion that action, rather than passive perception, is the basis of consciousness has recently acquired many advocates. But here again, there is a pitfall that we believe needs to be avoided in this approach: if we insist that action must undergird all conscious states, then, as Aizawa (2006) points out, it becomes mysterious how a totally paralyzed person can still be completely conscious. The action-based account must make room for the imaging of action to play the same kind of role that overt action can play. And in our view, this means that an account of representation is needed in which the representation of the goals of actions, and also the representation of imaginary actions themselves can play an important part in making cognitive contents conscious.
Furthermore, we need an account of how these imaginary action representations can take place on an implicit or unconscious basis when our attention is directed outward to the external world. Jeannerod (1997) has been a source of major insights about the role of action imagery, and it is commonly accepted that intentional activity requires some sort of internal modelling of the external environment (Grush 2004). Ironically, those who call themselves enactivists all too often eschew any role for representations of the environment, and therefore reject action imagery as opposed to overt action in providing a grounding for the understanding of objects.
What is needed to reconcile these two streams of work on consciousness into a coherent story, and thus also to avoid the two contrary dangers of either underemphasizing the role of action or failing to account for the paralysis example is a story

Could moving ourselves be the link between emotion and consciousness? 
about the specific way in which both emotion and motivated action can ground conscious states other than emotional feelings and the imagination of actions – especially how they can ground perception and perceptual imagery. We suggest that the brain activities involved in self-initiated action are indeed crucial to subserve consciousness, but also that these action-initiating circuits are crucially dependent on motivational processes grounded in the emotional brain.
We have been assuming up to this point a fundamental difference between action and merely complicated systems of reactions. This distinction has often been regarded as an outmoded and untenable Medieval teleology. But in recent years there has developed a scientific account of the difference between action and mere reaction in terms of self-organization. To be sure, action in this rudimentary sense does not require representation of the goals of action. It requires only that a system’s own self-maintaining structures determine the contours of its movement in a way that is robust relative to environmental inputs. The system seeks out, appropriates, and replaces the environmental substratum elements that it can use to subserve its own patterns of activity. The patterns of activity remain relatively constant while its micro-constituents are continually replaced. This simpler notion of action, however, is an important component of the fuller concept of action.
The fuller kind of action includes not only the ability to move ourselves, but also the ability to plan a movement by imaging the action and the achievement of the goals of the action. This imaging of an imagined action as a goal is what we mean by suggesting that consciousness must include some kind of representation. Can there be action (in this fuller sense) without representation of some kind? We don’t think so.
So on the one hand, we should not conflate these two senses of “action” with each other and assert that only self-organization is necessary for consciousness. The caution at the other extreme, of course, is that we should not reduce emotion to a mere re-action, which would under-emphasize the role of action in the more basic sense.
The thrust of our argument is that the motivation to activate motor imagery relative to environmental situations is an important ingredient in all forms of consciousness, including perceptual consciousness. Because initiating motor processes is an action rather than a mere reaction, we can clearly see that the sum total of afferent nervous processes – processes in which we receive information which then gets processed in a sequence of reactions – can never produce consciousness, not even perceptual consciousness. A significant amount of motivated action-initiating activation is needed for consciousness. The modality and qualitative content of the consciousness may vary depending on what kind of afferent input is present, but the existence of the underlying conscious state is not a result of the afferent inputs.
Those who would like to minimize the role of emotion in consciousness and cognition counter this point by insisting that emotion is merely a power switch for the cortical processes that actually subserve consciousness (for example, Bickle

 Ralph D. Ellis & Natika Newton
1998; 2003). But the evidence just mentioned (which will be discussed further below) suggests that a significant amount of motivation toward self-organized action is necessary for consciousness, whereas afferent input may actually be necessary for conscious perceptions only in the way that the perceived object is necessary. That is, afferent input affects the what-content of consciousness, but may be as little a part of the substrate of the consciousness as the perceptual object itself is. Afference partly determines the content of consciousness, but is not sufficient, at least not by itself, to serve as the process that does or executes the consciousness. The self-initiated action commands, which ground the action imagery needed for consciousness, are an indispensable part of the actual substrates of consciousness.
2.  The enactivist approach and the problem of action imagery
Our proposal can be characterized as a version of “enactivism” (Varela et al. 1991). Enactivism holds that cognition is structured by sensorimotor patterns of the interaction of an organism with its environment. This claim entails that conceptual understanding is rooted in the understanding of our own actions, which in turn are understood in virtue of our ability to represent them in sensorimotor images. Thus all types of general and abstract concepts are grounded in sensorimotor experience. For example, I understand the abstract logical concept of conjunction because I am familiar with the activities of collecting, gathering, and grouping physical objects. One might say that all cognition is an activity of constructing metaphors for the concrete simple actions we performed as infants. The idea of concepts as metaphors was explored by Lakoff and Johnson (1987). An earlier version was proposed by the cognitive scientist Margaret Boden, who argued that the angel Gabriel, as a disembodied being, could not have learned the abstract terms he used to “talk of abstract matters to a human woman” (Boden 1982: 130).
More recent enactivist accounts of cognition and consciousness start from the same idea: no explanation of these phenomena can ignore the fact that the subject is an embodied being – that our bodies as they interact with the world essentially shape our concepts and our experience. The Cartesian notion of the incorporeal subject is a dead end. After this recognition, however, accounts diverge. Some take the idea so literally as to view the conscious thinking subject as an entity extending beyond the brain, into the physical environment with which it interacts (Clark 2008). Others go in the opposite direction, and understand embodiment to refer to bodily events at a microscopic level. Noë (2004), for example, grounds conceptual understanding in the physical adjustments of the sensory organs when processing and focusing on incoming stimuli.

Could moving ourselves be the link between emotion and consciousness? 
The earliest pioneers of the current enactivist movement adopted neither extreme. Lakoff and Johnson (1987) located the grounding of concepts in overt physical actions, and identified human conceptual structures with metaphors for basic actions and bodily orientations. For example, in multiplying long numbers in the head, we imagine ourselves performing the act of moving numbers around, “carrying the nine,” etc. Johnson-Laird (1983) pointed to the central role in reasoning of “mental models” based on sensorimotor experiences. Glenberg (1997) and Barsalou (1999) took this idea further: all concepts, abstract and concrete, are experientially grounded in common bodily activities.
We adopt this middle position in our interpretation of enactivism. Conscious experience is structured by sensorimotor activity; concepts used in cognition are grounded in self-world interactions; and preconceptual grounding of these concepts is found in primitive sensorimotor experience. All of these types of mental activity are located in the brain, in what Jackendoff (1987) has called, after Marr (1982), “intermediatelevel” processing. Low-level processing handles local feature detection, and high-level processing abstracts away from the details to identify general categories. Intermediate level brain events provide the contents of experience. This means that while they may be unconscious, they may also be conscious, and either way they may help form the content of conscious experience.
We have proposed a model (see also Ellis & Newton 2010) in which early motor movements in infancy lay down experiential patterns that become the basis for action representations. These, in turn, ground all higher-level concepts. We say that all these concepts are based on action images.
2.1  Imagery and representation
It is a tricky matter to use the term “image,” as a noun or as a verb, because traditionally it has referred to images in the sensory modalities only, and even more narrowly (and more commonly) to just visual images. I can image the sight, and also, independently, the taste of an orange lollypop. In the same way I can imagine myself lifting a book off a shelf. Note that in this case the image need have no sensory components except those of the way the action would feel to me. Action images in this sense are not visual images of what I would look like doing the action; they represent the way my body would feel when doing it.
We wish to speak of action images in a way that will both allow them to be conscious or unconscious, and correspond to the sense of action image in Jeannerod’s usage. Jeannerod argues that action images that are initiated in the cerebellum and the motor cortices precede implementation of overt actions and that these images represent what it would feel like for the subject to perform the action. Since many voluntary actions are not consciously planned in advance – for example, the complicated

 Ralph D. Ellis & Natika Newton
individual body movements I must make to walk across the room – some early representation of the actions must be formed preconsciously in order to set the activity in motion. We prefer to use the terms “images” and “representations” interchangeably because, just like sensory images, they are reproductions of earlier experiential traces of performing the actions, and they represent the actions in that they can be used in planning, initiating, and evaluating the action. These representations are about the actions of which they are traces.
We argue that very primitive forms of these images are laid down during the original thrashings and flailings of the infant even before voluntary movement becomes possible. They are the results not only of sensory input produced by the action, but also of the “efferent copy” – the action pattern that the motor system saves in issuing a motor command, and the memory of the emotional valence of the action – was it successful or frustrating in trying to reach the toy? The infant produces an initial repertoire of these action images, which it can then draw upon, consciously or unconsciously, when it is ready for volitional action. Involuntarily reaching for a desired toy provides imagery of all the arm’s motions, as well as of the desirable toy; when more control is gained, the infant can select from that repertoire the movements that were most successful in attaining the goal.
We also argue that it is in terms of these initial movements that the desired object – the toy – is initially understood: as something attainable by means of those actions, in particular the individual actions and hand positions appropriate to that toy. The toy, in other words, is an early “affordance” in the infant’s environment. That we understand objects in terms of the uses we can make of them explains phenomena like “utilization behavior” in certain kinds of brain damage: the patient can’t name or describe the toothbrush but can grab it and use it appropriately. An important aspect of this account of action images is that it can include an explanation of intersubjectivity– our ability to share intentions, emotions, etc. with other observed subjects. The “mirror neuron” hypothesis (Rizzolati et al. 1996) fits neatly into the theory that action images ground the earliest concepts. Mirror neurons allow the subject to recognize and represent the intentional actions of others by means of the same neural activity that is active when the subject herself performs similar actions. These neural groups, when activated both by the subject’s proprioceptive sensations when performing an action and by the sight of another person performing the same action, provide a grounding for the concept of the other as a subject who has the same kinds of intentions and experiences as the viewer. Because these neuronal responses appear to be hardwired and not a result of learning, subjects naturally acquire concepts of other persons at an early stage in infancy. Thus, as Jordan Zlatev (2007) argues, self-movement does not develop in solipsistic isolation, but rather evolves in a context that includes others capable of the same intentional actions.
Is the account of action imagery and consciousness that we are proposing circular? Many assume that it must be, and hence that we are invoking a regress in claiming that

Could moving ourselves be the link between emotion and consciousness? 
imaging precedes consciousness of objects. It is not circular, because the original formation of the motor image was an automatic product of the infant’s random motion, and becomes conscious only when voluntary motivated action becomes possible. Eventually, motivated goal-seeking actions require a selection from the stored and growing repertoire of motor patterns. In planning a voluntary action, one activates the various images and simultaneously inhibits them from triggering actual movements. Images are necessary for conscious action because the subject must “try out” the various hypothetical experiences that will result from the various choices, and compare them with others. Thus the subject is paying attention to the feelings aroused by the various images, and this motivated attention brings them to consciousness. Thus images themselves are necessary but not sufficient for consciousness.
3.  Emotion, self-organization, and consciousness
The idea that emotion is an indispensable ingredient of consciousness in all modalities is not new. Cytowic (1993), Damasio (1999), and many others have shown that we can gradually eliminate cortical areas without eliminating “core consciousness,” whereas if we knock out emotional areas, all types of consciousness become impossible. Even the recent “enactivist” accounts of consciousness – which in our view need to elaborate much further on the role of emotion – at least in principle do acknowledge that emotion is inseparable from self-motivated, consciousness-producing activity on the part of the subject.
However, even some who recognize the centrality of emotion insist that the role of “emotional” areas is that, in addition to subserving emotion, those same brain areas also release neurotransmitters to the cortex that have nothing to do with emotion or self-initiated activity, and thus are merely necessary in the way that supplying electrical current is necessary for a radio to work. Many of those who stress the importance of emotion in consciousness nonetheless seem, in spite of this emphasis, willing to accept the view that the radio (the cortex) is still what makes the music (consciousness). They grant, or at least allow the possibility, that the subcortex is only a way of getting the power to the radio.
This view treats emotional states as mere afferent stimuli on a par with external sensory input, although in the case of emotion the afferent “input” comes from the viscera of the body rather than from external perception. Such a view therefore tends to reduce conscious cognition to a passive reception and subsequent processing of exteroceptive and interoceptive data. As we argued in Section 1, Damasio’s recent work is an example of this overly-afferent and thus corticocentric view of the consciousness of feelings. Such a view does not further an enactivist account of motivated consciousness as tied up with action affordances.
What evidence is there to suggest that action is really necessary to consciousness? It is true that we need not overtly perform any action in order to be conscious. Even a

 Ralph D. Ellis & Natika Newton
totally paralyzed person may sometimes be conscious (Aizawa 2006). Our thesis is not that action is necessary for consciousness, but only that possible actions must be imagined by the subject (usually implicitly) in order for that subject to have intentional consciousness of objects. We “understand” objects, in Newton’s (1996) sense, by imagining how we might act relative to them. This means that we initiate the brain processes that would normally lead to the corresponding overt action, but then we may inhibit the action command before the efferent signal reaches as far as the body’s extremities. This can happen either deliberately, as when the motor, premotor or supplementary motor areas release inhibitory neurotransmitters to the cortex, even while the action is still being imagined; or it may happen involuntarily, as when paralysis results from a deficiency of efferent pathways.
3.1  Phantom limbs
In cases of “phantom limb” experience, the subject may imagine moving a limb that has been amputated. In such cases, even in spite of the lack of the corresponding afferent feedback, the subject still feels as if the limb were actually there. Many researchers find evidence for the hypothesis that the sense of the phantom limb movement occurs because the movement has been imagined by means of sending the efferent signals to the limb. “A preserved sense of agency provided by intact premotor processes translating intention into action may lead to the vivid feeling of movement in a paralyzed limb, similar to kinesthetic illusions in amputees. The interruption of thalamic afferences may explain the persistence and stability of the phantom by preventing any correction of the mismatch between expected and effective movement” (Staub et al. 2006: 2141). “The results suggest that the presence of a phantom limb, whether painful or painless, is related to the sympathetic-efferent outflow of cutaneous vasoconstrictor fibres in the stump and stump neuromas” (Katz 1992: 811). “Our data suggest that the experience of phantom hand movement involves the activation of hand motor commands. We propose that preserved hand movement representations re-target the stump muscles to express themselves and that when these representations are voluntarily accessible they can instruct the remaining muscles to move in such a way as if the limb is still there” (Reilly et al. 2006: 2211)
We should remain cautious in proposing implications of phantom limb experiences, because some of the underlying physiological facts remain controversial. Some maintain that efferent processes alone can cause the phantom limb experience (Katz 1992; Levine 2007; Staub et al. 2006), without much in the way of afferent feedback. Others (for example Gandevial 2006; Ramachandran & Blakeslee 1998) believe that phantom limb experience and phantom limb pain (if not phantom limb movement) may result from afferent feedback from pathways that grow into the now-defunct part of the parietal lobe. Also, the explanation of phantom limb movement may be

Could moving ourselves be the link between emotion and consciousness? 
very different from the explanation of phantom limb pain. The pain per se may result from the fact that no afferent feedback is received to cause corollary discharge of the electrical potential built up in the efferent system – the system that sends the action command outward to the body parts to be moved; or it may be caused by afferent feedback that is mismatched to those efferent action commands. But clearly, efferent processes play an important if not determinative role in either case. Ramachandran (see Ramachandran & Blakeslee 1998), even though he believes that afferent processes play a role in phantom limb pain, still emphasizes that the pain involves a mismatch between efferent signals and afferent feedback.1
What the phantom limb experience means for our purposes – especially the experience of phantom limb movement – is that efferent processes can play a crucial role in creating our conscious experiences. The phantom limb movement studies even suggest that, at least in some cases, we may sometimes consciously experience things primarily by means of efferent processes. We shall not argue this stronger claim here, because it is sufficient for our purposes to note that efferent processes are an important part of conscious experiences. Just by trying to move a phantom limb, the subject may consciously feel as if the limb were there. Other examples below will make a similar point about conscious experiences in other modalities – vision, for example.
It is also important for our purposes to note that in the case of phantom limb movement consciousness can occur not because the subject actually does move anything, but because the subject is imagining moving. This imagining of self-movement is subserved by brain processes similar to those in actual movement, all the way up to the point where the process may be interrupted, either by a deliberate inhibition coming from the frontal cortex, or a severing or sedating of nerves in the efferent pathway. So movement is by no means necessary for consciousness, as paralyzed patients show, but efferent processes that gear us up to imagine moving are an important part of understanding the action affordances of objects, and therefore play a role in our consciousness of them.
3.2  Inattentional blindness and utilization behavior
A similar conclusion is suggested with regard to visual consciousness if we carefully consider the Mack and Rock (1998) “inattentional blindness” findings. As long as the
1.  This is the basis of one of Ramachandran’s treatment methods for phantom limb pain. The pain can be reduced by artificially supplying some afferent feedback – for example, by having the subject “move” the missing phantom limb simultaneously with the remaining real one, and rigging mirrors so that the subject can “see” the limb moving, and thus receive afferent feedback through the visual system that is a better match for the efferent signals being sent through the motor system. Ramachandran believes that this procedure reduces the imbalance between the efferent action command and the afferent feedback from it.

 Ralph D. Ellis & Natika Newton
subject’s attention is pre-occupied, the subject fails to see a stimulus even when it is presented at or near the center of the visual field for up to 250 ms. Mack and Rock do not discuss the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying their behavioral observations, but we know from other sources (e.g. Aurell 1989) that 250 ms. is about how long it takes for the occipital area to be fully activated and to perform all the transformative functions on the incoming afferent signal. This means that, in the case of vision, all afferent processes can take place without any visual consciousness. I.e. all the relevant afferent information has been received within the first 250 ms., yet there is still no consciousness of the object, nor any conscious memory of it afterward. Consciousness of an unexpected object does not occur until a P300 electrical potential is observed in the parietal area. (In event related potential studies, the numbers, e.g.“P300,” refer to the number of milliseconds after presentation of the stimulus.) So the parietal P300 occurs at the point when efferent activities affecting the parietal area come into play.
When we say “efferent,” we mean nervous activity that normally would lead to some bodily movement, unless inhibited to form action imagery. Those efferent activities in turn seem to be preceded by an action-initiating circuit that in normal subjects interconnects the cerebellum with the thalamus and hypothalamus (Haines et al. 1997), beginning as early as 18 ms. after presentation of the stimulus, and then involving frontal areas, which are activated as early as 100 ms. (Damasio et al. 2000).
In event related potential studies, during the first 200–250 ms. of perceptual processing, there is a spreading of activation that is essentially afferent – i.e. a signal that results from receiving and transformation of incoming perceptual information. The afferent activity spreads from the stimulation of the optic nerve to transmission of signals to the thalamus, and from there to the occipital lobe. The studies show that all of these afferent processes can reach their full activation with no consciousness of the object. The occipital lobe has performed all its duties of interpreting the lines, shapes and colors of the object, but with no consciousness of the object. Only when a P300 event related potential occurs in the area of the parietal lobe does consciousness of the object result. Moreover, this parietal P300 does not occur merely as a result of spreading of activation from the occipital lobe. The speed at which neural signals travel would allow spreading of activation to occur much faster than the 100 ms. delay from occipital to parietal activation. The story must involve the fact that early hippocampal (18 ms) and cerebellar (20 ms.) activation (Woodruff-Pak 1997) – both brain areas involved in developing motivated action routines – then lead to a 100 ms. frontal ERP (Damasio et al. 2000). The frontal ERP would correspond to the inhibition of an action command. So it is very likely that brain processes associated with action commands – the early cerebellar and hippocampal activities – activate the P300 parietal ERP, and when this parietal activity resonates with occipital activity, that is when we

Could moving ourselves be the link between emotion and consciousness? 
become conscious of the object, because we have now understood some of the object’s action affordances, even though we have not overtly executed an action.
The implication, then, is that even afferent visual processing does not become conscious until it is combined with motoric and efference action-initiating processes that correspond with the motivated imagining of how we could interact with the object through bodily movement. Granted, this motor imagery occurs at a minimally conscious or even unconscious level. But it is still an intentional process in the sense that it potentially could be available to our conscious awareness in certain kinds of reflection, and normally occurs just beneath the surface. And it is fine-tuned to our experience, as when we find that complicated calculations of social situations have unconsciously affected the way we felt like acting, all at an unconscious or pre-conscious level. The implicit motor imagery is present even though we do not overtly perform the corresponding actions, in the same way that a musician might minimally imagine fingering a heard melody on an imaginary musical instrument, without even being aware of doing so.
If this hypothesis is true – if we are conscious of objects by imagining how we could interact with them, and if we do so by forming action commands which then are inhibited to prevent overt action – then we might reasonably ask what would happen with a subject whose frontal inhibitory processes had been prevented by brain trauma. There are indeed such cases. In a rare behavioral disorder called “utilization behavior,” the subject often becomes unable to perceive objects without actually performing overt actions relative to them (see L’hermitte 1986). For example, if the subject sees the doctor’s coffee cup, he automatically picks it up and tries to drink (even if the cup is empty). If the subject walks into someone else’s bedroom, he automatically lies down on the bed. Whatever typical action comes to mind relative to the particular object, the subject overtly does the action.
What makes the utilization behavior patient different from the norm is a deficiency of frontal inhibitory activity, just the kind of activity that Jeannerod (1997) shows is needed to image an action without performing it overtly. If the difference between normal and utilization behavior subjects hinges on the deficiency of the frontal inhibitory circuits needed to inhibit action commands, this fact would be highly consistent with the hypothesis that normal subjects, like utilization behavior patients, do form motor imaging when we see objects, although pre-consciously. The difference seems to be that, unlike utilization behavior patients, we are able to imagine the actions without actually going through with them, thanks to our normal frontal inhibitory activity.
If utilization behavior is consistently found to be caused by a deficiency of inhibitory neurotransmitters coming from the frontal brain areas, then it is reasonable to suppose that, in normal experience, we understand objects by imagining ourselves acting upon them or interacting with them, while at the same time we inhibit those action commands frontally, so that the overt action does not actually occur. In the case

 Ralph D. Ellis & Natika Newton
where the frontal inhibitory process is deficient, the subject is unable to inhibit the imagined action, and as a result goes through with it.
3.3  Libet’s paradox
Our hypothesis also explains the long-debated Libet “readiness potential” paradox (see Libet 1999). The paradox is that the brain activity that presumably subserves an action is observable .5 second before the willed action occurs, whereas the subject is aware of the choice to perform the action only .1 second before the action occurs. Libet assumes that this means that the actual choice occurs unconsciously .4 second before we consciously will it. The paradox, then, is that we feel that we are deciding to do an action that our brains had already decided to do .4 seconds earlier.
The idea that action requires a preliminary imaging of the action that is to be decided upon explains this paradox. If the brain activity observed by Libet corresponds to the initiation of an action, then it also makes sense that this brain activity would correspond to the preliminary imagining of the action – i.e. the motor imagery of ourselves doing the action, even in the absence of the overt action. Typically, when we are deliberately deciding whether or not to do an action, we first form a motor image of the action as a part of the deliberative process. Part of the question we form to ourselves has to do with what it would be like to perform that action. So we must image the action, in the sense of Jeannerod’s motor imagery, in order to decide whether to overtly do the action. And this means that the brain processes that would subserve the overt action have already begun, even before we have actually decided to go through with the action. The initiation of the action command is a part of the process of imagining ourselves doing the action, and normally we do this before we decide to actually do the action. The brain activity that subserves an imagined action is very similar to the brain activity that subserves the corresponding overt action. The difference is that, in normal deliberate actions, the point when we decide to go through with the imagined action is the point when the frontal inhibitory processes are damped down, and the action command, which was already underway, is allowed to lead to overt action. This frontal inhibitory process is just what the victims of the utilization behavior syndrome are unable to perform, because of frontal brain trauma or chemical imbalance of frontal inhibitory neurotransmitters. (For further discussion of this point, see Ellis 2005, esp. 142–149).
3.4  Experiments with monkeys
The same conclusion is implied by the behavior of Donoghue’s monkeys (see Donoghue 2002), who are taught to play a computer game, and then electrodes pick up the electrical signal from the brain activity that subserves the monkey’s action command to facilitate moving its hand to move the joy stick. Now the monkey can merely think

Could moving ourselves be the link between emotion and consciousness? 
of moving its hand, and the computer cursor moves just as it would if the monkey had actually moved its hand. Moreover, as the experiment proceeds for a day or two more, the monkey gradually gets away from the need to focus attention on its hand movements, or even imagining the hand movements, and seems entirely focused on the computer screen itself. I.e. as Donoghue describes it, there is a gradual transition from conscious motor behavior to motor imagery, in the sense of the monkey’s moving its own hand and then only imagining doing so, to a final situation in which the monkey no longer even needs to think about its hand at all, but only focuses on the results produced on the computer cursor that is being moved. As described by Donoghue, the monkey seems only to be wanting the computer cursor to move. More recently, the same technique has been used to electrically pick up the monkey’s brain signals to move a robotic arm (Velliste et al. 2008.)
Such an experiment would not be possible if not for the fact that the brain activity that subserves action imagery – the image the monkey forms of what it would be like to move its hand – were not very similar to the brain activity that subserves the corresponding overt action. The difference is that in action imagery the same action command is orchestrated just as it would be for an overt action, but then it is frontally inhibited. So when Donoghue’s electrodes pick up on the signal of the action image, they are picking up the same signal as when the monkey was overtly executing the action. This further confirms Jeannerod’s account of action imagery, in which frontal inhibition is the extra ingredient that makes the difference between overtly executing an action and merely imagining the same action. And, at least in this case, it also suggests that the Jeannerod neurophysiological story corresponds to an unconscious yet intentional and mental activity, because of the gradual transition from overt to merely imagined action, while the same motor and parietal area activity is maintained across this transition. In the case of Donoghue’s monkeys, the imagining of the action then becomes sedimented, and the monkey’s conscious attention is directed only to the cursor on the computer screen (or to the movement of the robotic arm in the Velliste et al. study). But in order to be conscious of what it wants the cursor (or the robotic arm) to do, the monkey is still implicitly imaging the moving of its hand, as suggested by the persistence of motor and parietal area activity similar to what was present in overt action. The movement of the cursor seems to be understood relative to the cursor’s action affordances for the monkey. And implicitly imagining the action affordance corresponds to much of the same brain activity as explicitly imagining it, which in turn overlaps with the brain activity that would be needed to overtly move the monkey’s hand. This also shows that there often can be implicit action imagery, even when conscious attention is directed to the external object.
The upshot of all these observations is that afferent processing of input by itself is insufficient for consciousness, and that action-initiating activity is needed to trigger consciousness of sensory stimuli.

 Ralph D. Ellis & Natika Newton
3.5  Action presupposes motivation
As we have argued, actions need to be motivated by something. We first want our hand to move, and as a result it does move. Although it is beyond our scope here to go into detail (see Ellis 2005; Ellis & Newton 2010), emotional processes that play a role in gearing us up for imagined actions can help us understand why this is the case. Panksepp (1998, 2000), for example, argues that mammalian emotional tendencies like play, exploration, nurturance, bonding, and what he calls “seeking” system (which includes primarily an endogenous “exploratory” drive) are the same circuits that initiate action. Their motivational thrust is primarily to gear the animal up for action. If we combine Panksepp’s emotion-action-initiating hypothesis with Jeannerod’s work on motor imagery, we can make the argument that the having of emotions is inseparable from an intentional (even if pre-conscious) understanding of some of the action affordances of the environment. As Jeannerod shows, when the elaborated action tendencies are inhibited, that is when we get action imagery rather than overt action. This connection provides further support for the view that, if understanding the environment is a way of assessing its possible action affordances, then emotional activations are an important element in this process.
Emotional activation is not dependent on specific inputs, but just the opposite is true: emotional activation is necessary for consciousness of inputs. Panksepp provides voluminous evidence that many emotional systems in mammals, such as the exploratory system, do not need to be reinforced in order to be activated. They are innately motivated and are independent of each other. I.e. we do not need to reinforce exploration with a consummatory reward; animals will explore regardless of whether the ­consummatory motives are reinforced by their exploratory behavior or not. Moreover, there is now ample evidence against the long-suspect implication of traditional behaviorism that, if an animal were completely satiated, it would not be motivated to do anything. Instead, each of the innate emotional systems in the brain has its own selfenergizing mechanisms making use of neurotransmitters triggered by brain-stem activation. This endogenously self-energizing view of motivation therefore offers resources not only to solve problems of mental causation and volition, but also more generally contributes to an understanding of what makes conscious processes conscious. Consciousness of the environment involves (usually unconscious) intentions to act toward it, not merely receiving and transforming inputs.
In enactivist approaches to consciousness, the difference between action and passive reaction suggested by these data can be understood scientifically via selforganization theory (e.g. Kauffman 1993). Complex systems maintain patterns of activity across replacements of physical components used to enact the pattern. Panksepp’s endogenous non-consummatory behaviors such as “seeking” control our attention, curiosity and exploration, and are motivated by the desire to engage in patterns of activity consistent with a complex system’s tendencies to maintain optimal

Could moving ourselves be the link between emotion and consciousness? 
homeostasis and complexity. The efferent and pre-efferent anticipatory gearing up for possible action relative to environmental affordances is at least an important part of the substrate of consciousness, rather than only the afferent receiving of inputs.

4.  Motivated action is a necessary component, but what about representation?

Many contemporary “enactivists” try to construe our intentional activities solely in terms of overt action. While this approach has the advantage that it avoids thinking of subcortical emotional contributions merely as “triggers” for cortical activity, it also should avoid a demand for overt action to carry more weight than it really can. One way in which this problem occurs is by trying to minimize the role of representation. Many enactivists see a stress on action as a way of sidestepping the difficult issue of representation. For example, Hutto (2006) wants to avoid information-theoretic or computationalist accounts by denying that representations (which traditionally entail conceptual interpretation) are part of the enactivist taxonomy:

The crux is that our primary modes of worldly and social responding do not

involve the manipulation of representations or any inferential thought. ... On the

contrary, we are intentionally directed at the intentional and affective attitudes

of others (that is what we are meant to target) by means of natural signs – the

expressions of others.

(Hutto 2006: 165–166)

The danger with this sort of attempt to avoid the errors of computationalist models is that it threatens to undermine the very enactivist approach Hutto supports. As we have argued, in any self-initiated action, the goal of the action must be represented as an essential component of the action program itself. Richard Menary, in his introduction to the volume on Hutto’s work just quoted, makes it clear that when Hutto and some other enactivists reject representation, they are thinking of representations purely as interpretations of afferent data. Hutto and Menary are right to be wary of these. But representations of internal goals as such are necessary to the guidance and completion of any self-initiated action. The motor programs essential to the planning and execution of any voluntary action include representations of the end-state, to which sensorimotor feedback from the completed action can be compared. These representations are sent as corollary discharge to the cerebellum and elsewhere when the action is initiated, and are held online for the duration of the activity itself.
The term “representation” has been the source of confusion in much recent literature. Enactivists rightly want to reject computationalist approaches that treat mental representations as meaningless symbols that map onto the external world and are manipulated by mental calculators. But if they do so by denying a role for representations in any sense of the term, enactivism will fail. As we have argued, action imagery

 Ralph D. Ellis & Natika Newton
that represents a planned action is central to voluntary motor activity (Jeannerod 1997). We have to imagine doing an action in the process of deciding whether or not to do it, and this involves imagery of what it will feel like to do the action: its intermediate stages and its conclusion. Entertaining such representations is not calculating over meaningless symbols; it is incorporating into cognition our interactions with the world. (For more detailed discussion of enactive accounts of representation, see Newton 2003).
It is widely agreed that the human cortex evolved in part to meet the need for complex and long-term action planning. Such planning, whether it involves preparing a meal or setting a distant educational goal, requires the weighing, over time, of a full range of alternatives, from minute-to-minute details of the process to anticipatory specification of the desired end state. This planning must be done in the head; one cannot try out these possibilities in the real world.
Planning and evaluating actions requires motor imagery, and we have argued that this motor imagery is not merely a non-intentional physiological event, but, even when it occurs only pre-consciously, it can still be an intentional one. In our view, entertaining motor imagery is the activity of representing bodily actions and interactions with the external world.
The mental process of representing is not simply a matter of encoding signals from the external world, although these may be incorporated into the representing process. Primarily, representations are mental models of the subject’s embodied activities, including the activity of sensorimotor experience. There is no question here of “accuracy” or “misrepresentation” of this imagery. The imagery is an essential part of a process and does its job as part of that process. If mistakes are made, these involve mismatches between a subject’s goals and the outcome of the attempt to attain the goal, not between a representation and a separate and distinct object it is intended to represent. Thus the view of representations as intrinsically meaningless symbols, manipulated syntactically in order to encode information about the external world, is completely inappropriate in the context of enactivism.
5.  Conclusion
We have argued not only that the neurophysiological substrates of emotionally motivated action commands are among the primary “neural correlate of consciousness,” but also that in fleshing out this view, we should be careful not to make one of two opposite mistakes. We should take caution not to under-emphasize action by having a view of emotion that makes the emotions that motivate “actions” themselves too reactive. On the other hand, we should be careful not to over-emphasize action by implying that any system that can act is conscious. That is where we believe it is necessary to bring in a kind of “representation” in which not only action, but also action imagery that represents the goal of an action is important.

Could moving ourselves be the link between emotion and consciousness? 
With regard to the role of the representation of the goal of an action: To be clear, we are not saying that some end-state out in the world must be represented. If we are sitting with our feet dangling in a swimming pool and moving them back and forth, the goal that we are representing may be simply to move the foot a certain distance in a certain direction. Or in some cases the goal could be just to move the foot in such a way that moving it feels a certain way that we can remember and plan to repeat. So we are not asserting that the “goal” is necessarily some outcome that would occur outside of our own bodies. But with that caveat, we can say that action requires representing what we want to do in some way.
In a very different kind of example, when we hit a baseball, we are not really representing a specific trajectory of movement for either the bat or our arms. What we represent in this case is that the ball (which also is represented) and the bat (which is not yet consciously represented) should make contact. In this case, what we represent is something external, even almost to the exclusion of representing anything within the body. Our attention is directed to something outside of ourselves, even as we plan and execute the action.
There can also be borderline cases between action and reaction. The classic example might be when improvising jazz. In some instances, we may have the idea of what we want a phrase to sound like before we execute it. Other times, we may merely automatically re-act, with a habituated pattern of finger movement. And in many cases, we may rapidly alternate between those two modes of playing. In effect, we alternate between “acting” and “merely reacting.”
So when we say that consciousness can occur only in beings that act, we are not saying that these active beings must always be acting in the fullest sense. However, they are always acting in the more primitive sense we discussed above – that is, in the sense of self-organization that is implicitly oriented toward goals needed for maintaining the self-organizational system. In living beings, this involves seeking out and appropriating material components (such as food) that can be used to maintain the system. That is, living self-organizing systems are always seeking homeostasis at a suitable energy level and any other activities required to enter or sustain their preferred patterns of activity. Understanding how we could act in relation to the environment, as opposed to merely re-act to it, is therefore a crucial requirement for an organism to be capable of consciousness. And this presupposes that the organism has emotion as well.

In this chapter, I argue for two claims. First, creatures that cannot understand themselves as potentially moving or being moved cannot have visual experiences of three-dimensional, spatial objects “out there” in the world beyond their skin. Whilst we might be unable to detect an outright contradiction in the notion of creatures without such understanding enjoying perceptual experiences indiscriminable from ours, it is, as I will attempt to show in the first part of the chapter, highly doubtful whether we can make full sense of their experience as an experience of three-dimensional objects “out there” in space. Second, we should nevertheless not endorse what Noë terms an “enactive” account of perception. In other words, the idea that a creature cannot have visual experiences of threedimensional objects without experiencing itself (or having experienced itself) as actively moving does not stand up to closer scrutiny.

1.  Introduction
Nobody seriously wants to contest the statements that I have chosen as a motto for this chapter. Certainly all parties to the debate I want to consider in the following pages agree that Gibson’s claims are correct as regards the vast majority of humans and animals. The dispute turns on whether there is any essential or necessary connection between self-movement and the capacity for visual perception. Phenomenologists such as Husserl (1997[1907]) and Merleau-Ponty (1962 [1945]),1 and, more recently,

1.  For two other (more recent) examples, see Sheets-Johnstone (1999: Chapters 3–5) and Gallagher and Zahavi (2008: Chapter 5).

 Søren Overgaard
defenders of the so-called “enactive” approach to perception such as Alva Noë (2004), have argued that there is.2 These philosophers have all held that there is a sense in which an ability to move is a precondition for the ability to perceive a stable world of three-dimensional, spatial objects. Others, however, have disputed this claim. They have maintained that whereas it might be the case that all seeing animals that inhabit the planet Earth – or indeed all seeing creatures throughout the Universe – are able to move themselves, this, if true, is merely a contingent fact. There could be immobile creatures that were endowed with visual perceptions just like ours. There is, then, no essential link between self-movement and visual perception. Such claims have not only been advanced outside the phenomenological tradition (e.g. in G. Strawson 1994). Recently, in fact, philosophers otherwise sympathetic to Husserl’s take on perception, Peter Poellner and A.D. Smith, have argued that he ought to have abandoned the ­thesis of an essential link between visual perception and self-movement.3
I shall argue for two claims. First, creatures that cannot understand themselves as potentially moving or being moved cannot have visual experiences of threedimensional, spatial objects “out there” in the world beyond their skin.4 My argument depends, in part, on a clarification of the point of a phenomenological elucidation of visual perception. I shall suggest that phenomenology attempts to make sense of perceptual experience “from within”. Whilst we might be unable to detect an outright contradiction in the notion of such “completely motionless creatures” enjoying perceptual experiences indiscriminable from ours, it is, as I will attempt to show, highly doubtful whether we can make full sense of their experience as an experience of three-dimensional objects “out there” in space.
My second main claim, however, is that we should nevertheless not endorse what Noë terms an “enactive” account of perception. In other words, the idea that a creature
2.  For present purposes an “enactivist” is someone who holds that “perceiving is a way of acting” (Noë 2004: 1), that is, that the ability to have perceptual experiences of spatiotemporal objects essentially depends on skilful, active movement. Could an enactivist, thus defined, also be a phenomenologist? An anonymous reviewer thinks not, but I disagree. Enactivism, as I understand it here, is a thesis about perception. Phenomenology, on the other hand, is a philosophical tradition loosely held together by particular methodological commitment – the commitment to let the phenomena, faithfully described, decide the fate of philosophical theory. There is no reason in principle why an enactivist could not accept that methodological commitment. In fact, I think Noë fits the bill. Perhaps Husserl does as well; he comes close, at any rate, to adopting the enactivist thesis.
3.  For discussions of themes closely related to the topic of this chapter, see Ellis & Newton’s and Sheets-Johnstone’s contributions to the present volume.
4.  I shall sometimes use the concept of “transcendence” to capture this notion of the perceived world as “external” to us.

Visual perception and self-movement 
cannot have the sort of understanding that the first part of my chapter argues is essential to visual experiences of three-dimensional objects without experiencing itself (or having experienced itself) as actively moving – this idea does not stand up to closer scrutiny. It is highly plausible, in my view, that the understanding in question must be derived from actual experiences of self-movement. But it is not obvious that among these experiences there must be experiences of active, self-initiated and self-controlled movement.
The former argument will be developed in the first part of this chapter. In the much shorter second part, I briefly, and somewhat tentatively, sketch my reservations vis-à-vis the “enactive” account of perceptual experience.

2.  The importance of self-movement

2.1  Making fully intelligible
The aim of Husserlian so-called “constitutive” or “transcendental” phenomenology is to make the life-world intelligible. More precisely, the task is to uncover the experiential structures that permit the world to be manifested or given to a subject. The aim of making the world transcendentally intelligible in this way should not be confused with the idealist project of reducing the world to subjective or mental structures. As Husserl explains:

In advance there is the world, ever pregiven and undoubted in ontic certainty

and self-verification. […] There can be no stronger realism than this, if by this

word nothing more is meant than: “I am certain of being a human being who

lives in this world, etc. and I doubt it not in the least.” But the great problem is

precisely to understand what is here so “obvious.” The method now requires that

the ego, beginning with its concrete world-phenomenon, systematically inquire

back, and thereby become acquainted with itself, the transcendental ego, in its

concreteness, in the system of its constitutive levels and its incredibly intricate

[patterns of] validity-founding. At the onset of the epoché the ego is given

apodictically, but as a “mute concreteness.” It must be brought to exposition, to

expression, through systematic intentional “analysis” which inquires back from

the world-phenomenon.

(Husserl 1970b: 186–187)

Two points need emphasizing here. First, the aim of Husserlian phenomenology is, as we might put it, a “hermeneutic” one. The point is not to prove, but to make intelligible. As Husserl writes, the phenomenologist is “unable to have any other scientific theme than that of transforming the universal obviousness [Selbstverständlichkeit] of the being of the world – for him the greatest of all enigmas – into something intelligible [eine Verständlichkeit]” (Husserl 1970b: 180). Second, this making-intelligible

proceeds via “intentional analysis”: we make the manifestation (or “being”) of the world intelligible by “inquiring back” from the world as manifested to the intentional experiences in which the world manifests itself. Ultimately, then, we will unveil structures of the “transcendental ego” – the subject to whom the world is manifested.
Obviously, this means there is a difference between the phenomenological idea of a condition of world-manifestation and the textbook notion of a “necessary condition”. To show that X is not a necessary condition of Y it is enough to produce a coherent example of Y without X. Thus, to show, for example, that believing that p is not a necessary condition of perceiving that p, we need only think of a case in which a person sees a pink rat running by; but, attributing the experience to the influence of alcohol or LSD, the person does not believe that a pink rat is running by. A condition for worldmanifestation in the phenomenological sense, by contrast, is something in the absence of which we cannot make a world-manifesting experience “truly” or “fully intelligible to ourselves”, to borrow some useful phrases from P. F. Strawson (cf. P.F. Strawson 1966: 11, 49, 106, and passim). For a phenomenologist, therefore, there can be cases in which X without Y is logically possible – involving no “formal contradiction” – but in which we cannot make X fully intelligible without Y.5
In particular, as we shall see, there can be cases where we can coherently imagine that creatures, which lack a certain feature we have, experience the world just as we do; but where, due to the lack of the mentioned feature, we cannot make their having such experience truly or fully intelligible to ourselves. In such a case, the phenomenologist will hold that the feature in question is a condition for world-manifestation, notwithstanding the fact that it is not a necessary condition in the standard philosophical sense. Because the phenomenologist is in the business of making intelligible, she or he has a special interest in the former, broader notion.
2.2  The problem of perceptual presence
I am right now looking at my coffee-cup placed on my desk. The cup is uniformly white, except for some writing on one side. From my current viewing position, however, I do not actually see the writing. The side facing me is uniformly white. However, the “rear side” with the writing on it is not an experiential “nothing” to me in this experience. My experience somehow seems to concern the cup as such, complete with front sides and rear sides – and an interior possibly still containing coffee (though I cannot tell from here). Compare the perceptual givenness of the desk. The cup occludes parts of the desk – namely, the parts directly under and behind the cup. Yet I somehow sense

the desk as present under and behind the cup, even though I do not actually see those parts of the desk. Generalizing from points such as these, Husserl writes:

The object is not actually given, it is not given wholly and entirely as that which

it itself is. It is only given “from the front,” only “perspectivally foreshortened and

projected” etc. While many of its properties are illustrated in the core content of

the perception, at least in the manner which the last expressions indicate, many

others are not present in the perception in such illustrated form: to be sure, the

elements of the invisible rear side, the interior etc. are co-intended [mitgemeint]

in more or less definite fashion […], but they are not themselves part of the

intuitive, i.e. of the [strictly] perceptual or imaginative content, of the perception.



(Husserl 1970a 712–13; translation slightly modified)

What are we to say about these co-intended rear-sides and interiors? Psychologists commonly speak of “amodal completion” – “amodal” because there is no sensory information regarding the parts of the table and the cup that are occluded. As at least the most enlightened psychologists emphasize, however, this does not mean that the phenomenon is not genuinely perceptual (e.g. Rock 1984: 120). It is no good saying, for example, that I somehow add the hidden and occluded features in thought or imagination. For, first of all, if I just glance absentmindedly at my desk, thinking of the text I am writing, is it at all phenomenologically plausible to claim that I add, in thought or imagination, any of the occluded features? Surely I do not. Yet no matter how absentminded I am, the various objects are somehow fully present to me as three-dimensional objects with occluded backsides and so on. Second, consider the sheer magnitude of the task of thinking about (or imagining) all occluded features of a scene as crowded with objects as my desk (full of books, papers, pens, and so on). Perhaps a powerful computer with the right sort of software might represent all these in a fraction of second; but it is hardly plausible to suggest that I might do so either consciously or unconsciously. Finally, consider the fact that when I imagine an object, I also imagine it as “presenting” itself from a certain perspective, with certain features “in view”, and thus as having certain other features that are not currently “presented”. (I cannot visualize an object seen from all perspectives at once.) We lose sight of this difference, however, if we say that the “unseen” features are imagined; because so, of course, are the “presented” features in this case (cf. Husserl 1997: 47).
Somehow, then, the presence of occluded features must be a “perceptual presence” (Husserl 1997: 43; Noë 2004: 60). We have a perceptual “sense” of their presence, even though they are not strictly seen or otherwise perceived. To a phenomenologist seeking an understanding of how our experience can present a world consisting of three-dimensional, material objects, this presents a problem, however. The problem is to make intelligible how we can have a perceptual sense of unseen features of a scene. How are we to understand their presence? Following Alva Noë,

whose take on this problem seems deeply influenced by Husserl,6 I shall call this “the problem of perceptual presence” (Noë 2004: 59).
Note that this problem will be central to a phenomenological account of perceptual experience. For arguably, it is crucial to the perception of objects as spatial or three-dimensional that we can have various different perspectives on them. But this precisely means having certain aspects of them in view, while others are “co-intended”, as Husserl puts it. It is obvious that other, strictly “absent” aspects or profiles must be somehow present. For unless my first glance at an object already somehow anticipates other possible views of the same object, it is hard to see how any subsequent perception of the object from another perspective could count as a perception of the same unchanged object. That is, unless any perception of an opaque, three-dimensional object, already co-intends absent profiles of the same object, a continuous perceptual process revealing the object from other sides can hardly count as manifesting the same unaltered object. There must already be more to the object than what I currently see if any subsequent experience is to reveal new features of the same, unchanged object.
But why is it important that we can perceive the same unchanged object from varying perspectives? If all aspects of perceived objects are fully manifest, then perceived objects change whenever the sensory given changes. Suppose the sensory given of a particular experiential sequence is the same as I have when I first view my coffee cup from a position directly above it, and then slowly move my head back and down so that the cup is now in front of me. As we might put it, the sensory given at first involves a circular shape (corresponding to the circular shape the cup projects onto my retina), and then gradually more and more elliptical shapes. Unless we make room for an object to present different profiles to a viewer, then clearly the perceived object in our scenario changes. Every change in sensory content is a change in perceived object. But how, in this sort of scenario, could my visual experiences be experiences of something out there in the so-called “external” world? The perceived object collapses into the sensory given. That is, the perceptual experience would seem to absorb the object, so that there would be no difference between the perceived object and the experience (cf. Husserl 1997: 97–101). We only have a visual experience of a transcendent, physical object if it is possible for the sensory content of the experience to change while the object remains unaltered. And we can only have the latter in so far as other profiles of the same object can be “amodally” co-intended.7
6.  Although I have only come across one single reference to Husserl in Noë’s writings (2004: 17), it is a reference to the volume that contains all the ideas I am outlining here.
7.  What, though, about shadows? Shadows seem to be objects “out there” in the world, even if they are not genuinely material in the way that cups and tables are. But although it is true, of course, that shadows do not have “sides” the way material things do, we can nevertheless

This means that if we are to make intelligible the perceptual manifestation of threedimensional objects we cannot ignore the problem of perceptual presence. From what was said above, it is not plausible that the key to this problem lies in the notion that we construct mental models or representations of the absent profiles. The task would be daunting, to say the least. And besides, the suggestion that we constantly engage in such internal-model building doesn’t do justice to the phenomenology of experience. But if we do not represent them, what is the status of the absent profiles? Both Husserl and Noë, in their respective ways, make the intuitively plausible suggestion that the absent profiles are “present” as somehow available, as something to which we have access (Noë 2004: 63, 67). They are, as Husserl puts it, “freely at our disposal” (Husserl 2001: 47). In other words, in having one side of the coffee cup strictly presented to me, the multiple absent profiles of the cup also have a certain presence, namely as profiles that are available to be (strictly) perceived. This, however, cannot count as a satisfactory response to the problem of perceptual presence. Surely, before we can be said to have made perceptual presence fully intelligible to ourselves, we must understand what this availability of the absent profiles amounts to. This question takes us to the heart of the Husserlian proposal.
2.3  Movement and perceptual presence
The proposal is marvellously simple. According to both Husserl and the enactive account, the basis of the availability of absent profiles is found in what Husserl calls our “kinaesthetic capacity”8 and Noë refers to as “sensorimotor skills” (Noë 2004: 63).9 It is, in other words, because we are able to move and thereby change our perspective on things that we have a perceptual sense of the co-presence of absent profiles. Thus, for example, the
view the former from various perspectives, some of which may reveal features of the shadow that are not revealed from other perspectives (see Smith 2003: 70). Moreover, we can obviously have amodal completion of shadows. Not only can objects occlude other objects, or parts of them; they can also occlude their shadows, or parts of them.
8.  Husserl (1970b: 162). Husserl coins the term Vermöglichkeit to capture this; see the German text of the Crisis: § 47; also Husserl (1973b: 284–5). Vermögen means ability or capacity, whereas Möglichkeit means possibility. A Vermöglichkeit is thus a possibility that I am able to realize.
9.  An anonymous reviewer points out that “kinaesthetic capacity” and “sensorimotor skills” are two very different things. The former is an experiential notion, whereas the latter is a physiological one that “has no anchorage in actual experience”. I think there is something to this point. In fact, I do believe Noë wants his sensorimotor skills to be understood as anchored in experience. Husserl and Noë, it seems to me, both want to claim that our awareness of absent profiles has to do with our ability to experience self-movement. But then here is the point: If that is what Noë wants, why the physiological vocabulary?

inside of my cup is available to me as something that would be (strictly) perceived if I view the cup from above; whilst the rear side is accessible as that which I would see if I moved around the cup (or picked it up and turned it around). All of this is perceptually present to me here and now because I have an implicit awareness of my potential (at least in principle) for moving, and of how such movement would produce ordered patterns of perceptual presentation. The “feeling of perceptual presence” we have of strictly absent profiles resides, as Noë puts it, “in the immediate accessibility, through control of one’s sense organs, of detail that is present there all along” (Noë 2001: 51).
Let me put some more flesh on this proposal. As Husserl likes to put it, the strictly or “properly” presented profile of an object such as a cup is embedded in a “horizon” of other profiles, which are not currently presented in the strict sense. And it is so embedded because my current “kinaesthetic” situation – my current bodily posture and position – is embedded in a “kinaesthetic horizon”, a horizon of “freely possible series of movement” (Husserl 2001: 52) and thus of other viewing positions which I might adopt by moving myself. I am implicitly aware of the two horizonal “systems” as correlated in such a way that if I were to engage in this or that particular series of movement, then such-and-such a sequence of object-profiles would be presented to me.
There is thus a certain systematic structure to the relation between the kinaesthetic horizon and the horizon of visual profiles. A movement of my head to one side will result in a “movement” of the visual profile in the opposite direction. If there is no such (quasi-)movement, then the object will not seem stationary, but will appear to move. A linear movement such as walking up to an object will be accompanied by a continuous quasi-expansion of the visual profile of the object. If not, the object is seen to change: either its position, by moving away, or its size (shrinking). Moving around an object will lead to a continuous revelation of new profiles of the object; again, if not, then the object will seem to be turning. And of course, the continuity of the visual appearances is crucial here. It is the gapless, continuous flow of visual appearances corresponding to the continuous movement around the object that gives me an experience of the “closedness” of the three-dimensional surface of the object (Husserl 1997: 175).
So, when I cast a glance at my coffee cup on the table, the whole three-dimensional cup is present to me perceptually because the strictly presented profile is encompassed by a multitude of absent profiles perceptually “present” as available but not presented. And this availability refers back to my implicit awareness of my own potential for bodily movement. My perceptual experience of the cup is an experience of it from a particular viewing position out of a multitude of possible viewing positions – positions that are, at least in principle, realizable via bodily movement. I am tacitly aware of the current distribution of (strict) presence and absence as one that is the result of my having realized this particular kinaesthetic situation out of an open-ended horizon of kinaesthetic possibilities.

Visual perception and self-movement 
It must be emphasized that the Husserlian claim is not that people who have become completely paralysed are unable to see transcendent, spatial objects. The crucial thing is that a subject has some (implicit) understanding of how visual appearances would change if such-and-such kinaesthetic capacities were exercised. A subject, that is, need not actually be able to exercise the skill in question. All he or she needs is an implicit understanding of the dependence of sensory appearances on self-movement. It might, however, be hard to see how a subject could acquire such understanding without at least at some point having had experiences of self-movement. This seems plausible to me, and I shall assume the truth of this claim in what follows; but I shall not attempt to defend it.
The Husserlian approach, as I understand it, will thus include the following claim:
(1)	Having an implicit understanding of oneself as potentially moving or being moved is a condition for the possibility of perceiving transcendent spatial objects.
Via the (I think plausible) idea that such an understanding can only be derived from actual experience of self-movement, we reach the further claim:
(2)	Having had experience of self-movement is a condition for the possibility of perceiving transcendent spatial objects.
The enactive approach, however, as suggested by its name, goes on to make a stronger claim. Perceiving, in Noë’s words, “is a way of acting” (Noë 2004: 1). “Perception is not something that happens to us, or in us. It is something we do” (ibid.). And again, “perceptual experience” is “a form of active engagement with the environment” (Noë 2001: 50). Note that the suggestion is not merely the plausible one that in fact perception is (mostly or generally) “something we do”. Rather, to say that perceiving as such is a way of acting, or a form of active engagement, is to advance a claim about the essential features of perception.
A similar emphasis on active movement is found in Husserl.10 In the Crisis, for example, Husserl stresses that visual appearances have the character of profiles or aspects of spatial objects “only through the fact that they are those aspects continually required by the kinestheses” (Husserl 1970b: 106). He goes on to say: “Thus sensibility, the ego’s active functioning of the living body or the bodily organs, belongs in a fundamental, essential way to all experience of bodies” (ibid., my emphasis).11

We are now in a position to formulate a third claim, which I shall call the “enactive” claim. The claim is as follows:
(3)	Having had experience of active self-movement is a condition for the possibility of perceiving transcendent spatial objects.
One might hold (1) without holding either (2) or (3). Thus, for example, someone who thinks that an understanding of self-movement could be innate will regard the argument I shall advance as missing an important piece. For anyone attracted to an empiricist outlook, however, I think the transition from (1) to something like (2) will not seem outrageous. In any case, as already indicated, I shall assume that this transition is not in dispute here. My discussion will therefore focus on (1) and (3). It is possible to hold that no (implicit) understanding of oneself as possibly moving is necessary for the perception of spatial, three-dimensional objects with absent profiles – that is, to deny (1). It is, however, also possible to accept it along with (2), but to deny the specifically “enactive” claim (3). On this view, some self-movement is a necessary condition for perceptual experiences of transcendent objects. But there is no reason to think it must be active self-movement.12

2.4  Recent criticism

The most straightforward way to prove the Husserlian thesis false is to provide a counter example: an example, that is, of some creature that is able to have visual perception of transcendent objects in just the way we do, but is incapable of any movement whatsoever, and has no understanding of itself as potentially moving either. Galen Strawson has offered an example that at least in part answers to this description. He claims we can imagine a sort of creatures – which he calls the “Weather Watchers” – that are “rooted”, like trees, and completely unable to move. Nevertheless, the mental life of a Weather Watcher is strikingly similar to ours. In particular, such a creature is fully capable of visual perception:

A Weather Watcher lives the rooted life, but there are many respects in which its

mental life is like ours. It sees the sky and hopes the clouds are bringing rain. It

watches a seed lodge in a gap between two rocks by the edge of the river. It forms

the belief that a tree may grow there before long, and hopes that it will.



(G. Strawson 1994: 255)

12.  This would seem to be the position advocated in Smith (2002: 146–7). However, Smith goes on to suggest (at p. 149) that the idea of a wholly inert subject who has visual perceptual experiences as of objects distributed in three-dimensional space is a metaphysical possibility. His position would thus seem closer to the one discussed in the following sections.

Visual perception and self-movement 

Strawson thinks that unless we can prove that the idea of Weather Watchers is incoherent, the idea that there is a necessary connection between the ability to move oneself and the ability to see three-dimensional, spatial objects, has been shown to be false. Whilst it may well be that all seeing creatures that inhabit our planet are capable of some degree of self-movement, the fact that we can coherently imagine creatures for which this is not the case, means that the connection is merely contingent.
Note, however, that the Strawsonian story so far does not involve a rejection of (1). His weather watchers might, for all we have been told, understand themselves as potentially moving around – even though in fact they are unable to move.13 However, others have advocated stronger claims that do involve a rejection of (1). Such points have recently been raised from within the tradition of Husserlian phenomenology. Peter Poellner, in particular, has invoked the possibility of Strawsonian creatures in direct criticism of Husserl:

Why should a subject only be able to think of, or perceive, an object as

having other, currently unperceived, aspects which could be perceived from

other perspectives, if it can also understand itself, practically or otherwise, as

potentially moving to take up those other perspectives? This does not seem to be

an a priori truth. There might conceivably be subjects who, while embodied, are

paralysed from birth and cannot experience or think of themselves as actively

moving through space at all, and who might yet take their surrounding world to

consist of spatial particulars with aspects unperceived by them, but perceivable

from somewhere else.

(Poellner 2007: 443)

Poellner clearly accepts that in order to have perceptual experiences as of transcendent, spatial objects, a subject must have a perceptual “sense” of absent profiles. What he rejects is the notion that in order to have this sense one needs to be able to move. In fact, Poellner rejects the weaker notion that one needs to understand oneself as potentially moving to take up positions from where these profiles would be visually presented. If so, his perspective cannot be reconciled with the Husserlian one.
In a footnote, Poellner makes it clear that he is committed to the strong claim that I am attributing to him: his target is the very idea that self-movement is essential to perceptual experiences as of spatial objects. As he writes, “Even if one accepts that a grasp of the possibility of movement is essential for perceiving a spatial object as having aspects currently occluded or outwith focal attention, why should this have to include

13.  Indeed, Strawson offers a genetic story that he calls the “rooting story”, according to which the natural course of development of a weather watcher takes it from “an active, mobile youth to a state of immobility” (G. Strawson 1994: 254). Given this story, of course, it is entirely reasonable to assume that weather watchers – despite their immobility – are able to understand themselves as potentially moving around.
