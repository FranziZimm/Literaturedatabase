INTRODUCTION Weopen the current essay with a necessary problematization of the terms of the title assigned us by the editors of the AnnualReview of Anthropology, whichwe have preserved precisely for this rhetorical purp.ose. Onthe one hand, the traditional notion of "language"dissolves as formal linguistics rarefies its object into a smallset of constraints onthe possibilities for autonomous syntactic structure, while semiotics andthe theory of "discourse" advancedby Foucault(58) erase the privilege of specifically linguistic signifiers in a universe of mediating signs and practices. On the other hand, "world view" [Humboldt’s(95) Weltanschauung]h, as served anthropologyas a term for the philosophical dimensionsof "cultures" seen as having a degree of coherence in time and space (174, 175; also l13a). Today, with our confidence in the coherence,integration, and political innocenceof cultures long lost, a term from the high-water mark of bourgeois "Germanideology" must be problematic.1 "Worldview" also suggests reflection and mastery of a repertoire of forms and meanings, neglecting the wayculture is shaped in everydaypractices belowthe threshold of awareness.Today,both theoretical inclination and the ethnographicdata force us to admit the fragmentedand contingent nature

of humanworlds, as opposed to their "wholeness" and persistence. Thus, where"world view" wouldonce have served, "ideology" is often heard, suggesting representations that are contestable, socially positioned, and laden with political interest.
Within these newframeworkslinguistic anthropologists and scholars in related disciplines are returning to classical questions about the relationships betweenlanguage and other forms of knowledgeand practice. (See the citations in footnote 3; also 96, 112, 167, 176, 177; and ethnographicstudies: 41, 68, 69, 89, 117, 144, 149, 168, 223). Ouressay first sketches someconceptual fundamentalsand then aims to correct certain widespreadmisrepresentations of the positions of Boas, Sapir, and Whorf. Wethen review the revival of interest in these three scholars, highlightingseveral importantreinterpretations o2f their workthat are producingnewresearch programs.
"LANGUAGE" AND "NONLANGUAGE"
Problematicin the first instance is the separation of "language"and "nonlanguage"such that these can be then "related" one to another. Thenotion of the "linguistic" versus the "nonlinguistic" eludes contemporarycultural anthropologists. Bloch (15), for instance, argues that whatis mostimportant about cultural knowledgecannot be represented in what he takes to be the terms appropriate to the discussion of language--such as "rules." Bloch is apparently unawarethat contemporarylinguistics conceptualizes speech production as the exemplarpar excellence of "embodied,""expert" knowledge(also see 208). In this the discipline returns to a position advocatedby Sapir (186) whomthe tacit, "aesthetic" quality of the form-feeling of actors for their culture meantprecisely that pattern in culture waslike pattern in language.
Thereis noprimafacie wayto identify certain behaviors---orbetter, certain formsof social action--as linguistic and others as cultural (cf 72). Eventhe most formal and minute aspect of phonetics--syllable timing---completely interpenetrates the mostidentifiably nonlinguistic, unconsciouspart of behavior-the timing of body movementsand gestures (see 46, 47; also 30, 114, 165, 195). Thus "language" and "culture" cannot be neatly separated by distinctions like "structure" versus "practice." Further, "meaning"can only be knownin another languagethrough social action and speech, and the relevant units for analyzing these in another culture can only be workedout through their language. Theentire intricate calibration is undertakenby the ethnographer in the field, often in an intuitive way.Theprocess finally yields a report (usually) in the ethnographer’s native language. So language, culture, and
2 Hill (87) takes a slightly different approachto these questions, emphasizingissues not treated
here. Thetimeliness of the issues discussed here can be gauged by a recent discussion on the electronic mailinglist, Linguist, whichdrewabout 40 responses, includingsubstantive discussions by N. Besnier, W.Kempton,A. Manaster-Ramer,and B. E. Nevin.

meaninghave inextricably contaminated each other in the course of doing ethnography.
LINGUISTIC RELATI3VITY IN THE THOUGHT OF BOAS, SAPIR, AND WHORF
Thestance of "linguistic relativity," a termcoinedtbr the cross-cultural epistemologyof the Boasiantradition by Sapir, is often taken to be a "hypothesis" that linguistic patterning at everylevel exhibits unconstrainedvariation, such that each languagemustbe approachedentirely on its ownterms (106:96). maintainthat "linguistic relativity" as proposedby Boas, Sapir, and Whorfis not a hypothesisin the traditional sense, but an axiom,a part of the initial epistemologyand methodologyof the linguistic anthropologist. Boas, Sapir, and Whorfwerenot relativists in the extremesense often suggestedby modern critics, but assumedinstead a morelimited position, recognizingthat linguistic andcultural particulars intersect with universals (64:9; see 200for a nuanced discussion of Boasian ethnography as "cosmography,"focusing on Sapir’s intellectual style.) 4 Boas,Sapir, andWhorfall recognizedthat kinds of cognitive organization quite general to humanbeings mightunderlie the capacity for language. Thus Boas wrote that "in each language only part of the complete concept that we have in mind is expressed" (18:43), recognizing, if only implicitly, that there is a domainof conceptualorganization that pre-exists language. WhileSapir regarded culture as "a historically derived, shared gestalt of patterns" (64:11; cf 4, 204:87ff)~ he also sought the mechanisms whichindividuals appropriated and configured such patterns, turning to the "personality psychology"of his day in the absence of a developedcognitive psychology.Whorf,almost echoingBoas, suggestedthat a pre-linguistic stratumorganizedlinguistic and cultural experience, "a universal ... wayof linking experiences whichshowsup in laboratory experiments and appears to be independentof language--basically alike for all persons" (235:267; see 134, 194:27-28; compare28:51ff).
Scholars approaching anew the relationship between language and world viewtoday problematizethe formulation of linguistic relativity with an increasingly sophisticated understandingof whatkinds of linguistic phenomena are likely to be universal aspects of humanpsychobiology,and regard this as a positive development(79). Aswe have noted, in doing so they do not depart radically fromthe Boasiantradition. Andthe sophistication with whichthey evaluate the status of proposed universals owes muchto Whorl whowas

acutely conscious of the cultural roots of the language of science. While admitting the likelihood of such universals, mostanthropological students of languageinsist that the epistemologicaland methodologicalfoundationsof the linguistic research through whichputative universals are identified must be subjected to reflexive scrutiny, for--a profoundly "Whorfian"point--it is entirely possible that these foundations are artifacts of Westernlinguistic ideology. Thusthey leave open the possibility that some"universalism" and the associated idea of biological innateness maybe a productof an essentializing ontology,deriving frompractices of referential objectification in European languages(13, 76, 200).5 Beckerproposesthat to think of our glossing of other languages as a form of access to "pure meaning" rather than as a set of metaphorsis to developan exuberanceof English: "the exuber~ancyof thinking of logical categories as reified ’things’" (12:142). Eventhe act of transcription itself is, for Becker, the political imposition of our own"languagegames"on the formsof life of speakers of other languages. Mostlinguistic anthropologists take a moremoderateposition, criticizing specific "universalist" programs while admitting the likelihood of dimensions of language where exuberances and deficiencies betweendistinct codes are minimized, such as abstract conditions on the relationships betweenanaphoraand their antecedents (29), or the extensions of terms for living kinds (5), and where attention shouldturn to similarity.
Boas, Sapir, and Whorfall limited their claims about the powerlanguage had over thought to specific, highly habituated, forms. Boas focused on the "selective power"of obligatory categories of grammar(104). Sapir emphasized unreflective, idiomatic expression (184) and wrote extensively about the alienation that might comewith scholarly consciousness of pattern (88). Whorlrestricts the linguistic phenomenoaf relevance to the habitual "fashions of speaking"(234).6 Theidea of "linguistic relativity" in the writings of Boas, Sapir, andVqhorfmustbe contextualizedhistorically. In their time a naive and racist universalism in grammar,and an equally vulgar evolutionismin anthropologyand history, werelively intellectual forces. Boas(18) criticized grammariansfor their tendencyto see the system of categories of Indo-Europeanin Native Americanlanguages, and argued that it wascritical to identify grammatical patterns by criteria internal to the language. Like his contemporary,
5 Comparebiologist Ernst Mayr(156:41), whoattributes essentialist thinking in evolutionary
theory to category formationand grammaticaldefiniteness in English. 6
Noticethat the "effability" of language(108), the possibility of translating utterances of languageinto anyother (194:27), is not at issue here. Thetranslatability argumentis pushedto its logical extreme by Davidson(39), whoargues that weretwo languages so radically incommensurate that translation is impossible, speakers of one wouldnot recognizethat speakers of the other werespeakingat all. Since Boas’s, Sapir’s, andWhorf’stheses rest on habitual uses of language rather than on radical untranslatability, Davidson’scontention is tangential to theirs. Hunt & Agnoli(96) proposethat the translatability argumentbe rephrasedin terms of processingeffort: principle, a statementin onelanguagecan be translated into a statementin another. Nevertheless, such a translation might render a natural, easily processed statement in the first languageas a clumsy, unmanageablestatement in the other.

Ferdinand de Saussure (192), Boas observed that grammatical meaning could only be understood in terms of the system of which it is part. Sapir also warned against the temptation to treat language as a set of labels on a pre-existing, noncultural (or "objective") world. Such a move would inevitably lead treating linguistic and cultural forms as reflexes of timeless, universal meanings, which could only prevent the ethnographer or linguist from understanding formal patterns in another culture or language. The famous passage from "The status of linguistics as a science" (187) needs to be understood this light:
It is quite an illusion to imaginethat one adjusts to reality withoutthe use of language and that languageis merely an incidental meansof solving specific problemsof communicatioonr reflection. Thefact of the matter is that the ’real world’ is to a large extent unconsciouslybuilt up on the languagehabits of the group. Notwo languagesare ever sufficiently similar to be considered as representing the samereality. Theworldsin whichdifferent societies live are distinct w7 orlds, not merelythe sameworld with different labels attached (187:162).
Sapir’s phrase "real world" is an ironic reminder that the naturalized world of our everyday experience is no more culturally unmediated than that of any other culture. His insistence that it is "to a large extent unconsciously built up on the language habits of the group" prefigures RaymondWilliams’s (239) characterization of language as a "constitutive material practice."
By the middle of the 1950s, a scholarly folklore grew around Sapir and Whorfthat hardened "linguistic relativity" into the familiar formula that treats language, thought, and meaning as three discrete, identifiable, and orthogonal phenomena(194:3-19). This formula rests on a category error that tdentlfies language, thought, and culture with the institutional fields of linguistics, psychology, and anthropology respectively. Such an error does considerable violence to the integrative thrust of the program Sapir and Whorf shared with Boas as they worked with him to create the modern disciplines of anthropology and linguistics. Boas (18), carving out an intellectual rationalization for anthropology as a science, argued for attention to the "unconscious patterning" in language as a guarantee of objectivity regarding "fundamental ethnic ideas," as a source of relatively pristine evidence of areal-geographic connections between peoples, and as evidence for the organization of categories in thought itself, in both culturally specific and universal senses. Sapir’s famous"different worlds" quotation appears in a frankly polemical context, in an address in which he argued for the necessity of a linguistic component in the social sciences. Against the trend of his times, Sapir movedincreasingly away from viewing language, culture, and personality as autonomous systems. In the

middle 1930s, during the period whenhe movedto Yale University to attempt the foundingof a broad interdisciplinary programin the social sciences (38), he appearedrather to regard such a viewas an unfortunate consequenceof the intellectual immaturityof the disciplines of linguistics, anthropology, and psychology, respectively (see 190:592). Like those of his teacher Sapir, Whorf’swritings cut against the grain. In an era whena leading figure suggested in the pages of the AmericanAnthropologist that muchcould be accomplished without fluent knowledgeof a field language, Whorfinsisted on the continued importanceof languagedifference--particularly difference in grammatical patterning--to ethnography.
Almostinvariably, textbooks and reviews refer to a "Sapir-WhorfHypothesis." Yet, just as the HolyRomanEmpirewasneither holy, nor Roman,nor an empire, the "Sapir-WhorfHypothesis"is neither consistent with the writings of Sapir and Whorf, nor a hypothesis. As Grace (77) has pointed out, the rhetoric of "hypotheses" and "variables" makessense only within a view of languageas a mapof nonlinguistic reality. Fromsuch a point of view, Grace suggests, it is impossibleto understandWhorf’sworkas anything other than a sort of failed attempt at a hypothesis. Yet such a viewof languageis hardly found within linguistic anthropology, rendering mysterious the universal perpetuation of this representation.
Note, however, Schultz’s caution against a monological assimilation of Whorf’s work to any single modempoint of view. Schultz (194) holds that positivist science and literary interpretation were in profound tension in Whorf’swritings, and suggests that attempts to assign them entirely to an "interpretive," "social-constructionist," or "ethical" tradition [as in the workof Fishman(56), Alford (1,2), and Grace], is as wrong-headeads attempts to Whorfonly as a scientist. Schultz argues for a Bakhtinian interpretation of Whorf’s work as a polyphonic (and even paradoxical) dialog between the voices of positivistic scienceandpoetic interpretation.
It is wrongto believe that the idea of language, culture, and thought as separate variables is somehowvalidated by the well-knowninsistence of Boas and Sapir on the separation of race, language, and culture. Statements like Sapir’s (183:218-19) that "the drifts of language and culture [are] noncomparable and nonrelated processes" have no direct relevance to any hypotheticodeductive "operationalizing" of a hypothesis of linguistic relativity. Instead they argue against a contemporarytendencyto naively assign "language" and "race" to archaeological remains. Further, Whorfdid not use hypothetico-deductive language; nowheredoes he speak of "dependent" or "independent" "variables," although his mathematical training wouldhave madehim thoroughlyfamiliar with suchlocutions. Instead, the "linguistic relativity" of Boas, Sapir, and Whorfis an axiom(cf 2:87). As with other workingassumptions, suchas "the arbitrariness of the sign," it can only be judgedonthe basis of the extent to whichit leads to productive questions about talk and social action (61), not by canonsof falsifiability. Yet the Boasiantradition does not pre-

clude subcultural universals, as Boasand Sapir implicitly andWhorfexplicitly recognized. Nor does it exclude cross-cultural and cross-linguistic laws of patterning. The moderndebate over "linguistic relativity" has consistently confusedassumptionswith research findings, axiomwith hypothesis.
In a narrower sense, however, a set of claims is being advanced: that grammaticacl ategories, to the extent that they are obligatory or habitual, and relatively inaccessible to the average speaker’s consciousness, will form a privileged location for transmitting and reproducingcultural and social categories. Grammaticalcategories will play a key role in structuring cognitive categories and social fields by constraining the ontology that is taken for granted by speakers. Suchan approachis hardly uniqueto linguistic anthropology. It has been proposedindependentlyof the Boasiantradition by philosopher W.V. O. Quine(169; see also 137) in his declaration that "entification beginsat an arm’s length," influenced by syntactic categoryand definiteness. A substantial body of experimental evidence supports the critical role that majorsyntactic categories play in the acquisition of wordmeanings(22, 73, 109, 141, 148, 219, 231, 232). The narrow interpretation of the Boasian tradition wouldalso fit well with a theory of "structuration," of the sort proposed by Giddens (74:121), in which structure is at once an emergent property of social interaction and constitutive of the interaction. Grammatical categories wouldstructure the cognitive and social fields at the sametime as they are themselvesthe sedimentedoutcomeof long histories of interaction (cf 45). Linguists workingon the discourse basis of syntactic categories (e.g. 70, 92, 93, 94, 224) have begunto explore the process of category formation, thoughstrategically underplayingthe importanceof hard cognitive constraints. Anthropologists have explored howgrammaticalcategories project social positions and relations, especially for the pragmaticsof person(48, 49, 59), and the types and hierarchy of social agents (9: Ch.4; 45, 199, 205). Theprocesses by whichgrammatical categories structure cognitive and social fields, or "Whorfianeffects" (112, also 96), havenot beentied into an integrated theory, both becauseof disciplinary boundariesand becausethe scholarly folklore has diverted attention fromthe narrowinterpretation of Whorfianeffects proposed above. The following section illustrates Whorfianeffects, using a familiar example.
WHORFIANEFFECTS: ENGLISH GENDEREDPRONOUNS
The structure of gender in the third-person pronouns of English provides a politically saturated exampleof a Whorfianeffect. Althoughthey makeup a relatively small part of the waygenderdistinctions are reproducedthroughthe language, the third-person pronounshave received disproportionate attention as the focus of conscious prescriptions since late in the 18th century. The exampleillustrates the complexityof interaction amongthe tacit structure of the categories, the cognitive prototypes associated with each category, the

pragmaticsof their use, grammaticapl rescriptions, and the tacit cultural frameworks and explicit ideologies associated with the categories. Thegendered pronounsof English have been the focus of consciousprescriptions for at least 200years, so they also illustrate the complexityof interaction betweenconscious domination-and-resistance and tacit hegemony.This summarydraws especially on research by Waugh(230) on the categorial hierarchy of the system, McConnell-Ginet(157) on prototype effects for incumbentsof roles designated with related gendered categories, Bodine (19) on the history prescriptive responses to the category system, and Silverstein (202) on the interactions amonggrammaticalstructure, pragmatics, and ideology. (See also 20:93-98, 32:218-24, 116, 150-152, 155, 209, 214.)
Figure 1 uses the non-object, nonpossessiveformsto stand for all personal pronouns.The+ value for eachfeature is the defining feature of the opposition and the morefocused semantically. The Ofeature is systematically ambiguous, betweenan interpretation in whichthe + value is denied(a "-" value) and an interpretation in whichit is merelynot asserted. Froma structural point of view, she has the interpretation [+FEMALE], while he can be understood as either [OFEMALE],with no assertion of gender, or [--FEMALE], that is, "male." Eachfeature that is higher in the tree sets up a contextfor an obligatorychoice betweenvalues of the feature that is one step lower.
A focal property of the system in Figure 1 is that he can be used in an indefinite sense (the default value or "O-interpretation") (whenthe sex of referent is unknownor irrelevant), or in an inclusive, generic sense, as in Everyonein NewYork State is entitled to an abortion if he wants it (example from230:305).

cept in the exampleabove), of course, is male. Evengeneric uses of he evokea maleprototype. In addition, for pragmaticreasons, "indefinite" he will normally be interpreted as male. Theseassociations are madehabitually by speakers, belowthe threshold of consciousness.Hereis a straightforward Whorfian effect, in whichthe structure of a systemof grammaticacl ategories affects the social ontologyposited by the speakers.
Prescriptive remedies for the difficulties that these associations produce were suggested as early as the late 18th century (19, 8:190-216). No fewer than 65 neologismshave been coined for a neuter singular pronounsince the middle of the 19th century. Amonogther options, for political reasons many speakersadopt they as a neuter singular. For theoretical or political reasons, somespeakerschooseto use she in a generic interpretation, andsomealternate betweenthe he andshe. The mostcommosnolution is to use they as a neuter singular. This has alwaysbeen a pragmatic option available to speakers who were choosing to conceal the sex of the referent. Other speakers have been socialized exclusively to a pronounsystem in whichthe default third person pronoun, singular or plural, is they--a system distinct from, and probably older than that in Figure 1. Useof singular they wasattacked by prescriptive grammariansin the middle of the 19th century. [A British Act of Parliament prohibited the usage within that body, requiring use of the generic masculine instead (19:131-33)
Prescriptive suggestions for a neuter or gender-inclusive pronouninclude using it to refer to humansT. his proposalprobablythils becausethe distinction betweenit and the other third person pronounsprojects a more deeply ingrained cultural postulate than the distinction betweenplural and nonplural, a distinction betwccnhumans(and somedomestic animals) as potential social agents and all other referents of nouns. Tomaintaina culturally morecentral distinction in the pronounsystems, manyspeakers of English are giving up (or have givenup) a moreperipheral distinction (cf 119:169-70).
The exampleshowshowa system of obligatory grammaticalcategories has cultural implications. The system naturalizes and reproduces categories of social action. The articulation of the grammarof pronominalgender with the categories of humannessand social agencystabilizes the grammaticalrepresentation of gender by restricting possible changesof the grammaticalsystem and, in turn, the systemof cultural reproduction. Thedirectness of the Whorfian effect is partly obscuredby the tension betweeninternal determinantsand external normativepressures, both establishing and eroding the generic masculine (202). Althoughit is an arena of conflict, the categorysystemcontinues function in everyday contexts even for speakers whoare examiningand purposefully remodelingtheir behavior, for, even as onepart of a categorysystem is broughtinto consciouscontention, other parts remainin place unchallenged. The category systemcreates a particular cultural hegemonyt,he unquestioned acceptance, by both men and women, of men as a normative, unmarked category of person (cf 163).

RETHINKING THE "SAPIR-WHORF HYPOTHESIS"
Weturn nowto a review of the most recent major readings of the work of Boas, Sapir, and Whorf. Most of this scholarship deals primarily with the writings of the latter, althoughthe workof Sapir has been of special interest for Friedrich. Themainsource for interpretations of Whorlis the posthumous collection by John B. Carroll (236), especially, "The relation of habitual thought and behavior to language" (234), the only essay that Whorl"prepared in his lifetime for an audienceof fellow linguists. 9 Beforeturning to the work of other scholars, webegin with a favorite emphasisof our own.
Boas, Sapir, and the Significance of Sound Patterning
Lucystates that nowheredid Boas "give detailed discussion or exhibit much enthusiasm or conviction about the possibility of language influencing thought" (131:81). This ignores one of the most penetrating discussions such influencein the history of linguistics, Boas’s1889article "Onalternating sounds." [Animportant discussion of the significance of the paper is foundin Stocking (211).] The relationship betweensound patterning and soundcategorization was also the site both of Sapir’s most significant contributions to modernstructuralism and his most convincing evidence for the relationship betweenlinguistic and cognitive patterning (185, 186, 189).
Boas(17) showedthat the apparent instability or alternation of sounds AmericanIndian languagedata illustrated not the imperfections of primitive languages but the fact that even trained scholars could not reliably hear a system of sound distinctions different fromthat in their ownlanguage. Boas thereby foreshadowsone of the most profound lessons of Whorf’swork: that the languages of Westernscholars, as muchas any others, imposetheir patterns on their speakers. Boas points out the embodiedand habitual nature of sound production: As speakers master production and perception, they simultaneously formulate a classification to whichnewsoundtypes are assimilated. Werker(233) has shownthat exposure to a native language shapes phonetic discrimination early in life. Whileall children are born with the potential to makeany kind of sound discrimination that is possible in a humanlanguage, betweensix and twelve monthsof age their ability to makediscriminations that axe not present in their native languageis sharply reduce&This reduction

is not a loss of auditorysensitivity but a "language-basedreorganizationof the categories of communicativesounds" (233:58), and maybe related to the infant’s developingcomprehensionof the native language. Thesephonological effects are instances of "categorical perception," in whichlinguistic categories establish thresholds that regulate perception (112; 96:381; 83a). Kuhl et (l18a) showthat the phonological effects of categorical perception can observedin infants as youngas six monthsold.
Sapir’s concept of "phonemic"pattern specified with great precision the systemic source of the categorial effects identified by Boas: the "inner configuration" of the sound system within which sounds acquired functional significance, expressed in patterns of phonotactic distribution, conditioned variation, and contrast. Sapir arguedthat categorization and formalpatterning in phonologywereaesthetic experiencesfor speakers, formsof "art" wherethe pronunciation of a soundwas like the accomplishmentof a step in the dance (Sapir 185:35). This recognition of an aesthetic "form-feeling" for language foreshadowsa contemporaryconcern with sound patterning as a significant and neglected form of humanexperience, a concern to whichwe return below.
Lucy’s Reformulation
John Lucy(131-133, 136) has attempted to breathe newanthropological life into the "hypothetico-deductive" reading of Whorf,thereby challenging our contention of the unlikely nature of such a project within today’s linguistic anthropology. His concern is an operationalization of a "Whorfhypothesis" that is consistent with Whorf’sownlinguistic practice. Lucycomplainsthat previous hypothetico-deductive workhas movedfrom its Whorfianroots by decentering "language"in favor of "cognition," makingthe former a dependent variable. Lucy (131, 132) emphasizes that implementation of Whorf’s analytic project requires recognitionof linguistic patterningona large scale, as in Whorf’sdemonstration of the habitual waysof speaking about time as an "entity" in Europeanlanguages. This example showsthat covert and overt principles of categorization in languagemayexhibit multiple unexpectedlinkages, and we cannot understand the impact these may have on a speaker’s categorization of experienceuntil their complexityis fully grasped. Lucyalso attempts a newconceptualizationof Whorf’sterm"reality," in order to avoid a naive realism that almost invariably turns out to be ethnocentric. Lucy(133) arguesthat "reality" mustbe explicitly "linguistic reality," defined against a universal grid, such as Silverstein’s (205) referential hierarchy of types nounphrases. Further, Lucyargues that a genuinely "Whorfian"ethnolinguistic project mustbe rigorously comparative,identifying the full penetration of particular linguistic patterns in at least two languages and comparingtheir impact on speakers.
Lucy’s research, comparingYucatec and English, focuses not on culture [although he praises Whorffor attention to the cultural resonances of grammatical patterning (131, 132)] but on thought, whichhe understands as

"autonomouslyconstituted cognition" (131:83). Lucy(133) finds three major types of noun phrases in both English and Yucatec, characterized in terms of universally applicable noun-phrase features: TypeA [+ANIMAT+ZD,ISCRETE], Type B [--ANIMATE, +DISCRETE] and TypeC [-ANIMATE, --DISCRETE]. English grammarrequires pluralization of Type Aand Type B noun phrases, while Yucatecgrammadroes not require pluralization at all. Instead, the grammaorf Yucatecrequires "unitization" (the process seen in English "a," "the," and "piece of") whennounphrases are counted. Analyzing descriptions of line drawings by speakers of the two languages, Lucy confirmed that the grammatieal patterns are in fact reflected in waysof speaking, at least in the experimental context. Experimentsusing recall and sorting showedthat English speakers weremorelikely to be sensitive to numberthan to substance, while Yucatecspeakers were the opposite. Lucyargued that this result was related to linguistic patterning: Englishspeakers presupposeunity centering on form, and find numberchanges interesting and noticeable, while Yucatec speakers presuppose substance and are thus somewhatindifferent to number; this is consistent with their characteristic grammaticalstrategy, whichis not pluralization of units, but unitization of substances.
Asgroundworkfor his ownstudy, Lucy(132) developsa series of critiques of earlier studies of linguistic relativity (also see 96:379-81),whichweexemplify with his discussion of research on color terminologies, a body of work that is often said to have accomplisheda "universalist" refutation of Whorfian "linguistic relativity" (14, Ill, 113, 140, to list only a few landmarksin an enormousliterature). 1° Lucy’s (132) important newcontribution to a critical tradition (of 84, 85, 153, 180, 238)arguesthat the "universalist" results of this color-terminology research are largely consequencesof conceptual and methodological choices. First, researchers on color terminology equate "thoughf’ (represented as acts of categorization and memory)with "processing potential," in contrast to Whorf’sownemphasison the actual and habitual. The operational goal of strict comparabilityacross subjects and languagesforces a reduction to decontextualized and purely denotational usage. Individual lexemesare studied withoutreference to their grammaticapl roperties or structural relationships in the lexicon. Lucyarguesthat precisely the domainof investigation, "color," with its parametersof hue, brightness, andsaturation, is constructed within the English language. Manylanguages in fact have no general wordfor "color." The imposition of this English category renders impossible the identification of other categories and parameters, for instance the Hanunro dimensionof "reflectance" or the Zuni distinction betweenyellowas a result of process and yellow as intrinsic. Finally, and consistent with a general tendencyin cognitive psychology,cross-cultural similarities in the experimen-

tal results are referred not to possiblemethodologicaalrtifacts or to patterns of communicationin the research task (cf 71, 135) but to biopsychology. Thus languagebecomesthe dependentvariable, and the initial "Whorfian"trajectory of color research is reversed. Lucydoescredit this tradition for serious attention to methodologya,nd it continuesto be an important Site for research on categorization (cf 138, 139, 140).
Cognitive Linguistics and the Large-Scale Structure of Language
In the last decade"CognitiveLinguistics" (linked to somedegreewith linguistic workin "Cognitive Anthropology")has developedtwo dimensions of the neo-Whorfianresearch program recommendedin Lucy’s programmaticstatements: exploration of the large-scale patterning of grammairn particular languages, and the developmentof a theory of linguistic cognition. Mostsocalled "cognitive linguists" see their project as emergingfrom contemporary theoretical linguistics, but in self-conscious opposition to a numbeor f important assumptionsof the latter (cf 36, 50, 55, 103, 120, 125-127, 164, 181, 216-218,237).
Cognitivelinguists take formal linguistic discontinuities to indexunderlying conceptualdiscontinuities. Thus, the boundariesof denotationof a linguistic elementare held to coincide with the boundariesof a cognitive schema(23, 34, 54, 120, 170, 215, 242). Chafe(27) has suggestedthat intonation units be surface indices of the packaging of consciousness in short-term memory (see also 240, 241). Strauss (213) suggests that syntagmaticcontinuities discontinuities at the thematic level in argumentationand narration maysuggest underlyingcontinuities and discontinuities in the organization of cognitive schemas. Langacker(125, 126, 127) argues that such schemastake the form of images. G. Lakoff (120, 122-124) has argued for the pivotal role metaphorin constituting cognitive schemas.Lakoffargues that his invariance hypothesis--"Metaphoricalmappingspreserve the cognitive topology [that is, the image-schemastructure] of the source domain"(121:54; cf 24)--allows his metaphoricalmodelsto be linked to Langacker’s grammaticalimages, with the latter characterizing the topologyof source domains.
Whilecognitive linguists haveadmittedthat their workcan be linked to the Whorfiantradition, they have not emphasizedcross-linguistic relativity (but see 120:304-37). Instead, Langacker(125) points out that although his grammatical theory clearly permits the possibility that the habitual waysof speaking in different languages are organizedarounddifferent systemsof imagery, he believes that the actual behaviorof speakers reflects a constant shifting of point of view, rather than construction of a fewhabitual images.Kay(110) has also urged attention to the fact that a languagecan encodemorethan one point of view at a time, as with the "Fregean" implications of the English hedge "loosely speaking" (whichimplies that there exists a formof speechthat is

"exact" vis-a-vis the world), versus the "Putnamian"implications of the hedge, "technically" (whichsuggests a "baptism"of appropriate usage by experts).
Cognitive linguists have not been muchinterested in culture. Quinn(172) attacks Lakoff for neglecting the cultural locus of metaphor. She finds that eight metaphorsvirtually exhaust the figurative strategies used by American English speakers she interviewed about marriage. She suggests that this occurs because their choice of metaphorsis motivatedby a cultural scenario about marriage, not by underlying image schemas rooted in bodily experience of space. Thecultural scenario, not the metaphorsthemselves, plays a constitutive role in representations of, and reasoning about, marriage. Quinnsuggests that cultural differences are only understandableif this is the case: Theknowledge of cultural scenarios is shared, but, unlike bodily imageschemasof the type suggestedbyJohnson(105), it is not universal.
Friedrich (67, see below) and Turner (227) criticize the single-mindedness with whichboth cognitive linguists and interpretive anthropologists have concentrated on metaphorto the exclusion of other forms of figuration. Turner turns several classic studies on their heads by showingthat the narrowfocus on metaphor mystifies the semiotic figuration of social forms such as totemism. His study and Friedrich’s (67) theory of interlocking master tropes have the potential of transforming the analytical apparatus of cognitive linguists into a frameworkof sufficient powerto elucidate cultural figuration.
Slobin (206, 207) endorses a limited neo-Whorfianposition that derives fromexplicitly comparativestudy. In a cross-linguistic survey of children’s narrative strategies using pictures as stimuli, Slobin and his colleagues found that from an early age children who speak different languages talk about identical pictures quite differently, in a waythat seemsto reflect habitual ways of encodingexperiencein their languages. Slobin suggests that manydistinctions used by speakers (such as aspect, definiteness, and voice) seemto have no function other than to be expressed in language: Theyare not present in experience. Slobin endorses the Whorfianposition that languages are not neutral codingsystems, but instead are "subjective orientations" to experience. Nevertheless, he proposesthat these orientations maybe limited in their impact, active only while weare "thinking for speaking."
CognitiveLinguistics is often vulnerableto the critique of "linguacentrism" (132). Rather than relating patterning in languageto patterning in nonverbal cultural or cognitive practice, linguacentric research relates a pattern in one formof linguistic organization to a pattern in another. Thusin Slobin’s work the independentvariable is grammaticalpatterning, while the dependentvariable is narrative strategy. These are both "linguistic" phenomenaS. upposed "cultural" scenarios, as in the workof Quinn(170-172)or Sweetser(215) based entirely on linguistic evidence, with no nonverbal attestation of these generalizations. Where"cultural" evidencefor a frameor scenario is proposed, it is usually anecdotal, as in Fillmore’s (53) exampleof children whowere astonishedto see an adult peel a grapefruit andeat it "like an orange."

Silverstein’s Semiotic Reading of Whorl
In contrast to the tradition that organizesthe study of the relationships among language, culture, and thought in hypothetico-deductiveterms, the remaining "neo-Whorfian"workthat wediscuss is largely semiotic or interpretive. Although Silverstein (198, 200-203, 205) occasionally speaks of "science," intends by this the conduct of linguistic analysis in rigorous comparative structuralist terms. Hedoes not talk about "independent"versus "dependent" variables. Instead, he argues that "the total linguistic fact, the datumfor a scienceof language,is irreducibly dialectic in nature" (202:220).Centeringhis workin Peircian semiotics, Silverstein places pragmatics and semanticson an equal footing, privileging the nonreferential, especially the indexical, functions of languageequally with proposition andreference. Silverstein refocuses Whorf’s"habitual thought and behavior" as "ideology" (also see 65, 222). "Linguistic ideology" enters into complexfeedbackrelationships with pragmatic practice and grammaticalform. In a related project, exploring the circumstancesunderwhichsuch feedbackis especially likely or unlikely, Silverstein takes up Boas’sinterest in the relative "consciousness"of patterning in languageand culture, developingpreliminaries to a theory of sites for conscious reflection onpatterning in language(201).
Silverstein (200) sees the suggestion of a systematic relationship between "the grammaticalstructure of the language"and an "ideologyof reference, an understandingat the conceptuallevel of how... languagerepresents ’nature’" (p. 202), as Whorf’smost significant contribution. Silverstein argues that Whorf’sinsight is crucially dependenton his developmentof a newinventory of analytic tools (especially, the distinction betweenovert and covert grammatical categories) through which grammatical systems can be rigorously identified. Onceidentified, systemsof grammaticalcategories can be seen to be "referentially projected" by speakersto produce"objectifications," notions like form, substance, time, and space. Theseare rooted in complexcontinuities anddiscontinuities in the structure of language,but are attributed byspeakers to the nature of experience.
Silverstein’s research goal is to generalize Whorf’sinsight "fromthe plane of reference to the whole of language function" (200:94). He argues that Westernlinguistics has tended to reduce all semiosis to reference. Theproblemis then to reverse this ideological project by developinga fully scientific and comparativetheory of language function, whichwill recognize that indexicality, not referencealone, lies at the core of languageuse.
Silverstein has explored the empirical implications of his theory in several case studies: of speech act theory as a manifestation of English linguistic ideology(200), of Javanesehonorifics in pragmaticand linguistic-ideological perspective (cf 48, 49), of the linguistic ideologyof genderin English(202), and of the pragmatic ideology of Chinookan(203).
Rumsey(179) develops Silverstein’s ideas in a particularly suggestive ac-

396 HILL & MANNHEIM
count of the interaction of structure, usage, and linguistic ideology. In English, he identifies at least two grammatical patterns that distinguish “wording” from meaning: the grammar of reported speech, which distinguishes direct discourse (faithful to wording) from indirect discourse (faithful to meaning); and the distinction in textual cohesion, identified by Halliday & Hasan (80) between reference, the use of discourse anaphors that implicate identical meaning (as in “Raylene told her very best friends. Then Bruce told them”), and ellipsis, a text-forming relationship that implicates identical wording (as in “Raylene told her very best friends. Then Bruce told his”). English linguistic ideology distinguishes meanings, properties of the world, from wordings, properties of talk. In contrast, in the Australian language Ungarinyin there is no distinction between direct and indirect discourse (and, in fact, the representation of “locutions” is not clearly distinguished from the representation of propositional attitudes such as wants and beliefs). Nor is there a formal distinction in Ungarinyin textual cohesion that might distinguish wording and meaning. Ngarinyin people, when discussing language, do not distinguish between talk and action, focusing instead on the social effects of words and seeing them as strongly connected with their referents. Rumsey suggests that the distinct linguistic ideologies of English speakers and speakers of Ungarinyin are closely linked to the formal patterning in these languages, mutually determining one another [although Rumsey hints that, since “a rudimentary formal opposition between direct and indirect discourse [has been present] from ancient times” (179: 357) in European languages, the linguistic pattern may be prior].
Perhaps the most probing and detailed working out of Silverstein’s (202) proposal of an irreducible dialectic among structure, practice, and ideology is Hanks’s (83) account of the relationship among the formal encoding of deictic elements in Yucatec, the practices of spatial reference among its speakers, and Yucatec cosmology. By characterizing reference as a form of practice, Hanks is able to develop a particularly subtle account of Yucatec usage. Hanks argues not only for the pragmatics of the referential, but also for the structure of the pragmatic, emphasizing that the effects of indexicality can be seen not as purely emergent but as schematized through the practice of speakers who repeatedly invoke indexical frameworks in accomplishing reference.
Ochs (161, 162) joins Silverstein in emphasizing the importance of the indexical functions of language: Such indexes can inculcate appropriate sociocultural dispositions in the course of language socialization (162:92; see also 193). Especially significant are indirect indexes. Ochs suggests that the contextual dimension of affect, along with the dimension of epistemological disposition (as manifested, for instance, in evidentials and hedges), are used cross-linguistically in the indirect indexical function, to constitute social identities and categories. Thus, Japanese affective usage (in the particles 20, ze, through which men express strong affect, and wu, through which women express hesitant affective disposition) indirectly constitutes gender. Samoan

LANGUAGE AND WORLD VIEW 397
evidential usage indirectly indexes the realm of phenomena about which one can speculate, precisely not including the thoughts and feelings of other people. Thus Japanese children acquire a folk theory about the aggressiveness of men and the gentleness of women, and Samoan children acquire a folk epistemology that characterizes other people’s minds as inaccessible and perhaps socially irrelevant entities. However, Ochs (16 1,162) emphasizes that children are active participants in socialization, such that indirect indexicality is not irrevocably deterministic.
Friedrich ’s “PoeticImagination ”
The second major neo-relativist reading of the classic sources within the interpretive and semiotic fold is that of Paul Friedrich (62-64). Friedrich argues that Whorf‘s neglect of the unique individual and of poetic language reflects his scientific and pragmatic roots; Sapir, with his emphasis on the aesthetic feeling for language and on the genius of poets, can inspire a new kind of linguistic relativity. In a neo-Sapirian formulation the unique individual imagination must take a central place, alongside structure and context, in a new relativism that will give as much privilege to the relatively indeterminate and chaotic dimensions of language as to the dimensions of structure and formal constraint. A relativism thus configured, Friedrich argues, is likely to give deeper insights than one focused exclusively on grammatical patterning, since poetic language is the most important locus of differences between languages (see also 10, 11, 102,221,240).
In operationalizing (if this is the appropriate word for the project of a scholar whose linguistic practice increasingly takes poetic form; cf 66) his understanding of the poetic and indeterminate aspects of language, Friedrich (67) has recently proposed a theory of five master tropes, arguing that overemphasis on metaphor in anthropology is impoverishing our understanding of the figurative power of language. Of special interest for our topic is his suggestion that these imply characteristic “entanglements” with extra-linguistic understandings. Thus “image tropes” resonate with primary senses of qualities, such as the sense of redness. Tropes of mood are involved in the emotional and epistemological foundations of understanding. Formal tropes resonate with the formal and statistical properties of the world, as in fractal forms. Metonymic tropes are particularly “political,” engaging with part-whole relationships in nature. Analogical tropes (these include metaphor) create new relationships among language, thought, and reality.
The figuration of language extends to the iconics of sound itself. Languages vary in the degree to which they exploit sound icons. They may do so both at the systematic paradigmatic level and at relatively inchoate levels that cannot be characterized in systemic-linguistic terms, yet may have clear resonance with affective and cognitive patterning among speakers. Recent studies of such phenomena are available (e.g. 9:Ch. 4; 4 2 4 4 , 52, 146:Ch.S; 160, 220). These studies, which find that sound patterning resonates intricately with conceptual

patterning, evoke the early Boasianworkon sound configuration and cognition (see aboveand 182, 188). Herethe configurations are loose associational networks, rather than closed paradigms.
By studying relatively indeterminate dimensionsof language and culture, they also present the sharpest challenge to date of the assumption, shared by cognitivist and interpretivist alike, that pattemconsistencypervadescognitive and cultural systems. Studies like these, along with those of DeBernardi(40), showinghowMalaysianChinesereligious practices fail to synthesize into a single self-consistent masterdiscourse, and of Leavitt (128) on the emotionally charged, linguistically marginal"infralanguage"of Kuamansipirit possession, effectively rescue their ethnographicsubjects froman overly focusedemphasis on intellectual order and openup the possibility of exploring’the morechaotic and inchoatesides of languageand social life.

Sherzer’s "Discourse-Centered Culture"

Approach to Language and

Building on Hymes’sdevelopmentof Whorf’s notion of "fashions of speaking" (97, 98; also 100, 101), Sherzer (196) challenges the priority of "grammar" in favor of "discourse." Sherzer suggests that a "discourse-centered approach" will moveawayfrom the virtual patteming of grammar,constituted by difference, or by large-scale patterning of covert and overt categorization, toward a moreconcrete and immediatedomain, about whichhe is deliberately vague. However,anaong the major meaningsof "discourse"--patterning beyondthe level of the sentence, Foucaultiansystemsof rarefaction and restriction that are ideologically constituted, and emergent,immediatelycontextualized and contextualizing, linguistic usage--Sherzer aligns himself with the last. Hearguesthat to center linguistic anthropologyin discourse, "the broadest and most comprehensivelevel of linguistic form, content, and use" (Sherzer 196:305), "enables us to reconceptualize the Sapir-Whorfhypothesis, because "discourse ... is the nexus, the actual and concrete expression of the language-culture-societyrelationship. It is discourse whichcreates, recreates, modifies, and fine tunes both culture and languageandtheir interesection ..." (Sherzer 196:296).
Sherzerfinds these processesto be mostvivid in artistic and poetic speech. This emphasis links the "discourse-centered approach" to the work of Friedrich, but there are also important differences: Thepoetic tradition elaborated by Sherzer (196, 197), Urban(228), and others such as Caton (25, 26) formal one, centering on Jakobson’s theory of parallelism, while Friedrich emphasizes the unstructured, chaotic, and emergent. Urban (228) sharply problematizes "individuality" as a cultural phenomenonw, hile Friedrich gives "individualism"independentheoretical privilege as the site of "imagination."
In addition to Sherzer’s ownillustrations, an exampleof this kind of approach is Mannheim’(s145) study of semantic parallelism in Southern Peruvian Quechuaverbal art, whichfinds that verbal art plays a role essentially

similar to grammaticalcategories in the Boasiantradition. Semanticparallelism constrains the variability of word meaningsby ensuring that they are learned relationally, rather than individually. Ramanuja(n172a, 173) finds entire landscape taxonomyembeddedin the classical Tamil poetic tradition, reproduced through poetic imagery, and mappedonto an affective "interior landscape." Fromthe position of a ritual novice, Trix (226) showshowBektashi Sufi ritual knowledgeis transmitted through, and shapedby, the poetry that is its vehicle. Verbalart is thus a mediumthroughwhichlexicai meaning, imagery, and religious knowledgeare reproduced and transmitted, sometimes by the conscious appropriation of a poetic tradition and sometimesby the unconsciousappropriationof the resources of a linguistic code.
Themostelaborate conceptualization and exemplification of the discoursecentered approachis developedby Urban(228). Urban argues that discourse must have priority over culture conceived as an abstract system of meaning, becausediscourse is public, and becauseit is both sensible (actually occurring and manifestedin sounddistributed in space andtime) and abstract andintelligible (in that speakers mustinterpret momentosf discourse based on historically specific networksof stylistic similarities anddifferences). In Shokleng, languageof Brazil, speakers haveideologized stylistic similarity and difference. Their ideologyof historical continuity is expressedin close similarities betweenmythrecitations by different speakers over manyyears. Their emphasis onsimilarity at the level of discourse, Urbansuggests, is accompaniebdya high tolerance of difference at the level of grammaarnd lexicon; this latter finding challengesSilverstein’s (201) suggestionthat ideological attention will be focused on maximallysegmentableand referential linguistic elements. The Shoklengideology of continuity and similarity contrasts with an ideology of continuity and difference in the NorthwestAmazon.Pascal Boyer (21) also posits a communicativebasis for cultural tradition. Both Boyer and Urban place the concrete momenot f discourse at the center of analysis, but only Urbandevelops a sense of the intricate dialectic betweenwhatis "sensible" and whatis "intelligible." Urban’semphasison the "sensible" is related to the exploration of the concrete powerof figures of soundreviewedabove.
CONCLUSION
Anera in whichthe study of the relationships betweenpatterning in language and patterning in other dimensions of humanknowledgeand experience emphasized universal relationships is giving wayto a morebalanceddistribution of scholarly attention. Nowthose relationships constructedwithin the terms of particular languages and cultural systems of usage and ideology can be approached with newsophistication. This sophistication includes increasing openness to universals amongthose influenced by a tradition of "axiomatic relativism," balancedbya healthy critical attention to the cultural foundations of linguistics itself.
