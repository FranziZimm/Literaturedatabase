This book owes itself in many ways to experiences I shared with four people along the verdant banks of the Maici, many years ago. For some time we lived a rustic existence along that clear, sinuous river, amongst a small tribe of people with a remarkable culture and language. All these years later that time continues to impact my life. And for that I am grateful.

1 Contextualizing the issues
1.1 Introduction
It’s an old question. Does language affect how you think? The answer, in very broad terms at least, has been debated for centuries. A very closely related question has been the focus of intense scrutiny among linguists and other cognitive scientists for less time, on the order of decades: do patterns of thought vary in accordance with one’s native language? Put differently, does there exist a sort of linguistic relativity, such that some aspect(s) of a person’s cognition depends on, or is relative in accordance with, the language employed by that person? To many, this is a fascinating question, and some even spend significant portions of their careers trying to obtain a satisfactory answer to this and related questions. One of the reasons the question is so fascinating (to some at least) is that, apart from any actual evidence that may be brought to bear in formulating a response, people often posit very divergent answers based on their intuition. There are likely few questions in the cognitive sciences that elicit such disparate intuition-based responses. To some, the answer is clearly “yes” and such respondents may even find it puzzling that anyone might answer negatively. To others the answer is patently “no”, and they may be equally perplexed by the opposing view. Given that personal experience and intuition are so clearly insufficient to arrive at a consensus vis-à-vis the answer to this question, empirical data are particularly crucial to generating an adequate response. Perhaps surprisingly, despite the deep historical roots of the question at hand, quality empirical data have only been arrived at somewhat recently. The purpose of this book is to introduce you to some of that data, acquired through the research of many linguists, anthropologists, cognitive psychologists, and others “ists” in related fields. Arguably, enough data have now surfaced in the relevant literature to arrive at some sort of satisfactory answer to this question. While the title of this book hints none too subtly at an affirmative answer, it is worth noting from the outset that careful examinations of the relevant data often suggest that more nuanced approaches to the answer (rather than a vociferous “yes” or “no”), and to the formulation of the question itself, may be warranted (see Malt and Wolff [2010:11]). Nevertheless, we will adopt the position that in some general sense the question must be answered positively, since the findings surveyed in this book are difficult if not impossible to reconcile with a negative answer.
The notion that thought patterns or cognition do vary in accordance with people’s languages is referred to commonly and in this book as the “linguistic

relativity hypothesis”. This hypothesis was first articulated, or at least first quasi-cohesively articulated, in the work of two well-known linguists, Benjamin Whorf and his teacher Edward Sapir. (Though they never actually referred to their ideas on the topic as a “hypothesis”.) For that reason, “linguist relativity hypothesis” is often employed interchangeably in the literature with “SapirWhorf hypothesis” or “Whorfian hypothesis”. Such interchangeability appears to be falling out of favor, though, and probably should fall out of favor completely. After all, the linguistic relativity hypothesis in its current manifestation differs in some ways from the important ideas put forth by Sapir, Whorf, or any of their influential predecessors whose work helped inform current ideas on the topic. Given that the hypothesis is continually evolving in accordance with the ongoing acquisition of relevant findings, it is in some sense inaccurate to credit any particular scholars with the hypothesis. This is not to suggest that the work of some, in particular Whorf, was not seminal to the florescence of the current crop of ideas on the subject. It clearly was, as we discuss in some detail below. Nevertheless, in this book we are not particularly concerned with the history of the linguistic relativity hypothesis, nor with meticulously depicting the ideas of any one researcher or set of researchers who has weighed in on the issue. We are instead concerned with depicting the increasingly clear tableau of evidence that is finally allowing us to rely on experimental data, rather than intuitions and anecdotal evidence alone, in deciding whether and how one’s cognitive processes are affected by his/her native language.
This introductory chapter serves several basic functions: One of these is to define the linguistic relativity hypothesis with sufficient clarity as to allow us to carefully survey the evidence for the hypothesis during the remainder of the book. This requires that some attention be paid to the history of work on linguistic relativity. What will (hopefully) result from this brief discussion of some well-known ideas in the literature is a crystallization of a more contemporary linguistic relativity hypothesis, one that is clearly related to the work of researchers such as Sapir and Whorf, but which is not married to any of their specific proposals. In attempting to define the hypothesis (or more accurately, set of hypotheses), we will consider some contemporary ideas that allow us to refine the notion of linguistic relativity by differentiating types of linguistic effects on cognition. We will also consider some common objections to the notion that linguistic differences impact thought, objections that vary considerably in merit. An ancillary aim of this chapter, taken up prior to the historically oriented discussion, will be to consider intuition-based arguments for and against linguistic relativity. This consideration should allow you to think about the issue from an experiential perspective, in case linguistic relativity is not

something to which you have previously given much thought. Finally, the more pragmatic aim of this chapter is to outline the remainder of this book and to demonstrate how the themes of each chapter will be woven into a cohesive set of claims offering support for the existence of linguistic effects on nonlinguistic cognition across human populations.

1.2 Intuitions regarding linguistic relativity
It is likely that many or most of us have had personal experiences during which it was hard to transfer a thought from one language to another. Even if you speak two or more languages fluently, it is often difficult to translate ideas accurately between them, and frequently it seems that concepts are being missed even after careful deliberations over a given translation. There are clear motivations for the phrase “lost in translation”. Even that phrase itself is difficult to translate into many languages. The 2003 film Lost in Translation, in which Bill Murray plays an American actor in Tokyo, befuddled at times by his surrounding culture and language, was given a number of different titles during its international release.
Have you ever tried to translate a joke from one language to another? This can be a difficult or even impossible task. So often, the foundational concepts of a humorous interaction cannot be accurately captured in a target language. If you have to explain a joke, after all, it generally ceases to be funny. This alone suggests that the humorous aspects to the meaning of any interaction cannot be completely translated, because translation so often entails the explanation of one set of lexical items in terms of a set of others. Take the following Chris Rock joke, selected from a random online joke generator: “I live in a neighborhood so bad that you can get shot while getting shot.” A simple joke, one line long, based on simple premises. But my suspicion is that, should you try to convert it into another language, particularly one not closely related to English, you will quickly confront difficulties. For instance, while the construction “getting shot while X” is commonplace to speakers of American English and can be translated into other languages, the resultant translations may not convey a number of relevant connotations associated with the phrase. Significantly, these missed connotations are not simply a case of absent cultural cues. They relate at least in part to a grammatical phenomenon, namely a morphosyntactic construction (“getting shot while X”), that is present in English and absent in other languages. To cite another example of countless options, Woody Allen once observed that “Some guy hit my fender, and I told him, ‘Be fruitful and multiply,’ but not in those words.” In this case, the humor

results from an English phrase that has no exact analog in many languages, and furthermore is not even explicitly denoted in the quote. Is it possible to “think” this joke in another language? Can we really understand the joke in another language that does not utilize the crucial phrase that is only obliquely referred to in the English original?
Of course translation difficulties are not restricted to humor. If they were, they would have little to offer in the way of evidence of non-trivial cognitive effects dictated by crosslinguistic disparities. Often, though, translation difficulties reflect systematic differences in the way certain semantic domains are encoded in different languages. In these cases, intuition (and, again, we are not claiming that intuition is sufficient to resolve these issues) seems to point to very different associated patterns of thought. Systematic differences of the sort I am referring to surface for example when one language has more words at its disposal when referring to a particular semantic category. Perhaps the most famous example here is the oft-incorrectly-cited case of words for snow in Eskimo. It has been claimed that Eskimos have dozens if not hundreds of words for snow in their language, a claim that we will see is remarkably exaggerated. Yet there are innumerable less extreme yet analogous examples. We will offer a few taken from personal experience. You may very well have your own examples.
Let me start with an example that is at least somewhat systematic and clearly relates to the cultures of two different groups of speakers who enjoy, perhaps to varying degrees, the same game: soccer. The groups are Brazilian Portuguese speakers and American English speakers. Categorizing in a very coarse manner, it is fair to suggest that the soccer-playing characteristics of Brazilians differs dramatically from that of Americans, both in terms of style and success in competitions. Stereotypically anyway, Brazilian soccer players rely on flair and individual ability, while Americans rely on teamwork, athleticism, and less on individual technical ability. Such differences between American soccer subculture and Brazilian futebol subculture are reflected in lexical patterns. So, for example, consider the words for two types of dribbles carried out in an attempt to maintain possession of the ball at the expense of an opponent. One of these involves the ball-holder lifting the ball over the defender’s head and retaining possession on the other side of the defender’s body. The successful completion of this maneuver is most often called a lençol (‘sheet’) or a chapeu (‘hat’) in Portuguese. (These differ from a related dribble called the lambreta [‘scooter’]). The metaphorical bases for these terms are transparent, since both refer to items that can be pulled over one’s head. In Brazil, if you are unfortunate to have an opponent give you a chapeu or lençol during play, you are likely to hear about it afterward. In pick-up games, discus-

sion often ensues after the completion of such a maneuver as to whether in fact the ball cleared the opponent’s head. In some contexts such a maneuver may be celebrated or talked about as much as the scoring of a goal. The point here is that there is often a significant amount of energy and discussion about whether a particular maneuver did or did not constitute a chapeu or lençol. Conversely, in my experience the attention paid to this maneuver is noticeably less among most American soccer players, quite possibly since this maneuver is not lexically encoded. That is, there is no common expression for this dribble in American English (though some Americans may on occasion adopt the Spanish term sombrero). Judging from intuition and personal experience only, it seems possible if not plausible that the absence of any relevant well-known terms for this maneuver has real consequences in terms of the conceptualization of the maneuver itself, and the degree of focus on it, by Americans. Since most American players lack a term for the concept to facilitate discussion of and verbally allow for emphasis of the act, it would be surprising to me if they thought about the maneuver in the same manner as Brazilian players (not impossible, just surprising). In other words, while the soccer cultures in question may play a role in emphasizing the dribble in question to varying degrees, the languages of the two cultures also seem to influence the extent to which the maneuver is conceptually reified.
Even in this very restricted domain of soccer playing across only two represented cultures, other examples could be purveyed. Another common dribble employed in soccer involves kicking the ball between a non-goalie opponent’s legs. Here again American English speakers are at a lexical disadvantage. I am aware of only one common term for this maneuver in American English, nutmeg, while I have heard at least four terms for this dribble (or, more precisely, variants of it) in Brazilian Portuguese: caneta (‘pen’), rolinho (‘little roll’), ovinho (‘little egg’), and saia (‘skirt’). Some players seem more concerned with pulling off such maneuvers than scoring goals. More to the point, some Brazilian players insist there are clear yet minor disparities between some subset of these maneuvers, all of which involve the ball traveling through an opponent’s legs and are represented via the same cover term in American English. So while Brazilian speakers may not have more words for snow than their American counterparts, it seems they have more words for varieties of soccer dribbles, which in some cases reflect nuanced distinctions between maneuvers and appear to have real consequences on the way the dribbles are conceptualized. Of course such experiential examples are useful for anecdotal purposes only, and I have not conducted any experiments to test for differences in the conceptualizations of these dribbles resulting from the manner in which they are described verbally.

Contextualizing the issues

Such cases from day-to-day life do hint at differences in vocabulary potentially generating differences in the attention directed towards, and the construal of, nonlinguistic features of our environment. Nevertheless, they also seem a bit trivial. They do not relate to major differences between languages, only to minor lexical disparities. And it would probably be a stretch to attribute pronounced thought differences to such minor differences in word inventories. But what about more systematic semantic differences between languages? If you have ever had the opportunity to investigate or learn a language that is completely unrelated to your own, you have likely uncovered such systematic differences. Consider an example from my own fieldwork among the Karitiâna, a group of about three hundred people who speak a Tupí language in southern Amazonia. When learning their language I was surprised to discover that the Karitiâna have no exact translation for ‘monkey’. Instead there are numerous words for species of monkeys that are familiar to their ecology, including õrõm (‘ateles paniscus’), pikõm (‘cebus apella’), irõnh (‘saimiri sciureus’), and ery (‘callicebus callicebus moloch’). It is fair to say that most English speakers would be unable to provide names for these species, since monkey-species nomenclature is not a part of their vocabularies. In fact, when presented with pictures of the relevant species, English speakers typically refer to them via the cover term “monkey” that has no analog in Karitiâna. So what are we to make of this? Is this just a trivial linguistic difference? The Karitiâna have potential cultural motivations for lexically accentuating differences among these species, and not grouping them in the way English speakers do. For instance, some of these monkeys (particularly pikõm) are considered great ingredients for stew, and are coveted food items. Others are not. Crucially, all the experiential evidence (a type which has clear limitations, discussed in Section 1.4) I have is consistent with the notion that these terminological distinctions and the absence of a basic superordinate cover term for ‘monkey’ assist in the Karitiânas’ discriminations of these monkey types. At the least, it is indisputable that there is no native concept for ‘monkey’ coded in the Karitiâna language, whereas myriad related concepts are coded in the language in a way that they are not for most English speakers.1 Now of course Karitiâna speakers can learn a superordinate term and most are familiar with the Portuguese term macaco, just as an English zoologist may learn an even greater range of names of monkey species. But the point remains that such non-equiv-

1 As research such as Berlin (1992) and Atran (1993) has demonstrated, in smaller nonindustrialized societies the most basic ethnobiological terms, characterized by developmental primacy, tend to refer to more specific species-categorizations than basic terms in English. In other words, the pattern evident in Karitiâna monkey terminology is not aberrant.

alencies across this semantic category hint at very real distinctions in the manner in which the animals in question are construed by speakers of the two different languages. For any pair of languages, an assortment of such systematic or near-systematic disparities in the structures of lexical categories may be adduced. Often these disparities owe themselves to clear ecological factors (e.g. differences in the flora and fauna encountered in the daily lives of Americans and Karitiânas), or some more abstract cultural factor (e.g. soccer concepts shared by many Brazilians). To many, including myself, it seems plausible that such lexical disparities reflect and reinforce differences in the way speakers conceptualize the relevant entities, even in nonlinguistic contexts. The intuition of others may not accord with this relativistic interpretation, though, and they may remain unconvinced by such anecdotal data. They may even find it implausible that the Karitiâna taxonomy of monkey species reifies/ enforces greater conceptual distinctions between monkey types, even during nonlinguistic thought. They may suggest instead that, just because most English speakers lack the hyponyms for certain monkey species, this does not imply that the speakers do not recognize or conceptualize the differences between those species, at least once they have some experience with the monkeys in question. Conversely, some might suggest that just because the Karitiâna have no superordinate term for ‘monkey’, this does not imply that they do not, or do not typically, recognize a class of species that English speakers label with the term ‘monkey’. I could offer more experientially based opinions and anecdotes based on time spent with the people, but these would not convince skeptics since opinions and anecdotes in and of themselves do not constitute objective data. After all, such intuition-based opinions may be subject to all sorts of biases on my own part, of which I may or may not be cognizant. As centuries of discussion on the relationship between language and cognition have demonstrated pretty clearly, anecdotes and experiential evidence alone will not resolve such debates.
The absence of complete correspondence of concepts across languages was first observed long ago. For instance, the 13th century English philosopher and friar Roger Bacon suggested that variances in semantic concepts across languages made loss-less translation impossible (Kelly [1979:9]). In this way his opinion diverged from another philosopher and clergyman who predated him by nine centuries, St. Augustine. For millennia believers of various faiths have struggled with the translation of their scriptures. It is a very onerous task, often taking decades, and many doubt that the resultant translations are in fact lossless. One of the many difficulties faced in such translation is the transfer of idiomatic expressions. Consider, for instance, translating a concept such as “lamb of God” into an Amazonian language. Just that phrase alone, which is

8

Contextualizing the issues

found in English translations of John’s writings in the Christian New Testament, presents a series of obstacles. An obvious one is that Amazonian cultures do not have sheep or lambs, and have often not typically been exposed to these species. Another is that shepherding is a foreign activity. These difficulties may seem more cultural than linguistic (assuming for now a simple division between culture and language), but other difficulties are not. The phrase itself relies on a metaphorical correspondence between animal sacrifice and other sorts of sacrifice, i.e. those required for spiritual salvation according to some believers of the scriptures in question. In other words, “lamb of God” indexes metaphors shared by speakers of English, while also indexing some major concepts (lambs and a monotheistic entity) that are foreign to many cultures. This phrase has been translated thousands of times into unrelated languages, but it would seem that in many cases there is some inevitable loss of meaning, however minor, across the translations. It serves as a useful illustration since it reflects the centuries with which people have been seriously struggling with representing the concepts denoted in one language in a language that does not share some crucial component concepts.
The difficulty of transferring concepts from one language to another is consonant with the notion of linguistic relativity. Such difficulty implies that, in some cases anyway, there are obstacles to thinking the same exact thoughts while utilizing different languages. In the light of such difficulty, it is not a stretch to think that different languages affect how their speakers think in general terms. But note that the latter claim is different than the former, and while the two are related the former cannot be offered as unequivocal support for the latter. The idea we are interested in here is whether different languages have demonstrable effects on the nonlinguistic cognition of their speakers. Difficulties in translation may provide intuitive support for this notion, but they do not directly impinge on the issue of nonlinguistic thought. Just because people speak in very different ways does not necessarily mean these speech differences yield disparities in how they think when they are not speaking. Furthermore, if real differences in thought are hinted at by differences in languages, this does not imply that the linguistic differences are themselves the shapers of those thought differences. After all, differences in conceptual and linguistic patterns may be due to some other underlying factor, perhaps broad cultural distinctions that yield affects on both language and thought. Regardless of the conceptual differences hinted at by challenges in translation, such challenges cannot establish a causal influence of linguistic disparities on thought, much as intuitions alone cannot. The inadequacy of such kinds of evidence has nevertheless frequently been ignored in the past, to the detriment of serious inquiries into linguistic relativity.

A brief history of the linguistic relativity hypothesis

1.3 A brief history of the linguistic relativity hypothesis
The genesis and dissemination of the linguistic relativity hypothesis has a long and, in many instances, contentious history. The hypothesis is closely affiliated with other tenets in philosophy and the social sciences, and is sometimes mistaken for them. For instance, there is a long line of influential writers who at some point appeared to equate thought with language, to varying degrees. This list includes Plato (1892:252), Kant (1988[1798]:278), Watson (1913), Wittgenstein (1922), and Humboldt (1988[1836]). For instance, Humboldt noted that “Language is the formative organ of thought… Thought and language are therefore one and inseparable from each other.” (1988:54) Now if language and thought are indistinguishable, it follows naturally that which language you speak will have a profound effect on your cognition more generally, assuming that differences across languages exist. In fact, the consequence of such an interpretation of the language-thought relationship is a sort of strong linguistic determinism, according to which your way of thinking is completely constrained and determined by the language(s) you speak natively. In the wellknown words of Wittgenstein, “The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.” (1922, proposition 5.6)
There are difficulties with the tack of equating language and thought. It seems clear, for example, that other species are quite capable of thinking, and often in sophisticated ways. Research on primates, for instance, is continually revealing new cognitive capacities of species ranging from capuchin monkeys to bonobos (see e.g. Tomasello and Call 1997). Research on dogs, dolphins and non-mammals, particularly a number of avian species, reveals frequently comparable results. Given that it is widely accepted that such species do not share language with humans, but clearly share a variety of cognitive abilities with us, it seems clear that language is not required for thought, and consequently should not be equated with it. Furthermore, studies with pre-linguistic infants suggests that they possess a variety of cognitive skills that one might assume requires language, but in fact precedes linguistic behavior ontogenetically. For example, infants are capable of some very basic arithmetic (Wynn [1992]).
Contra the simplified assumptions of some scholars (e.g. Pinker [1994]– see Section 1.5), however, contemporary work on linguistic relativity does not presume that language and thought are completely dissociable. Researchers who do this work are concerned with whether crosslinguistic dissimilarities yield dissimilarities in thought, and with establishing not only the existence but the magnitude of such potential dissimilarities. This very distinguishable issue has also received a fair amount of attention in the literature over the

10

Contextualizing the issues

years, and it is worth tracing the trajectory of the idea, so that we can contextualize the contemporary work discussed in this text. I should stress that what follows is an extremely abbreviated discussion of the history of work on linguistic relativity. For more detailed treatments on this subject I refer the reader to works such as Aarsleff (1982) Koerner (1992), Lucy (e.g. 1992a, 1997, 2004), and Leavitt (2011).
There is a reason that the terms “linguistic relativity” and “Sapir-Whorf hypothesis” are often employed interchangeably, and further that the second term is often shortened to the “Whorf hypothesis”. The reason is simple: more than any other researcher, Benjamin Whorf was responsible for formulating a coherent treatise on the effects of linguistic differences on thought. Whorf’s work on the topic was clearly heavily influenced by his mentor, Edward Sapir, whose own work was colored by Franz Boas and other American ethnolinguists such as William Whitney. Whitney was, in turn, influenced by the renowned German linguist Wilhelm von Humboldt. The latter researcher’s views were themselves affected by correspondence with linguists in America such as John Pickering and Peter Du Ponceau, not to mention some of the ideals that surfaced during the French enlightenment (see Aarsleff [1988]). In short, the lineage of influence on Whorf can be traced back to increasingly remote timedepths, and to some extent the cut-off point to such a tracing is arbitrary. Some, though by no means all, of the central components of a linguistic relativity hypothesis are evident in the work of scholars such Johann Hamman, Johann Herder, and even Ferdinand Saussure. In fact, the prevalent structuralism of the early twentieth century, which owed itself so much to the work of Saussure, was very compatible with the more explicitly relativistic views of Sapir and particularly Whorf (see Gumperz and Levinson [1996], Koerner [1992]). Structuralism suggests, after all, that components of semantic systems such as a particular morpheme are imbued with meaning only in the context of the oppositions they present to other components. In other words, the meaning of a particular morpheme or word can only be comprehended contextually, within a greater semantic matrix. Given the readily apparent divergences between semantic systems across languages, it arguably follows from structuralism that the meaning of a given word or morpheme, and the associated conceptualization of a given denoted entity, depends in large measure on the language being utilized. At the least, it seems clear that structuralism was not inconsistent with the notion of linguistic relativity.
Given the prevalence of ideas that were consistent with a linguistic relativity hypothesis of some kind during the latter part of the 19th century, the first part of the 20th century, and even earlier, it is difficult to definitively establish authorship of the hypothesis. Koerner (1992:174) makes the following pertinent

observation: “As Christmann (1967) has shown, essential ingredients of the idea can be found in the writings of a number of 17th- and 18th- century thinkers, among them Vico and Herder, with the result that Justice (1987:56) spoke of a ‘Vico-Herder-Humboldt-Sapir-Whorf hypothesis’.”
Still, while the geneses of many hypotheses are difficult to pinpoint, there is often a clear stage at which an idea or set of ideas is more wholly developed and lucidly delineated, at which it has truly “arrived”. In the case of linguistic relativity, it seems clear that this arrival only occurred with the work of Benjamin Whorf. Which is not to suggest that Sapir’s work is not extremely important in this context. In fact, among other contributions, Sapir was the first author to co-opt the term “relativity” for linguistic purposes:
It would be impossible to go on indefinitely with such examples of incommensurable analyses of experience in different languages. The upshot of it all would be to make very real to us a kind of relativity that is generally hidden from us by our naïve acceptance of fixed habits of speech as guides to an objective understanding of the nature of experience. This is the relativity of concepts or, as it might be called, the relativity of the form of thought. (1949 [1924]: 159)
It is important to stress, though, that Sapir still viewed humans as sharing an essential psychological common ground, or psychic unity, a perspective he shared with his mentor Franz Boas, the founder of American anthropology who stressed the psychic unity of mankind (see Lucy [1992a] for discussion). As noted in Sapir and Swadesh (1964[1946]:101): “All forms of linguistic expression are reducible to a common psychological ground, but this ground cannot be properly understood without the perspective gained from a sympathetic study of the forms themselves.”
Another important view shared by Sapir and Boas was the notion that the influence of culture on language held more strongly than the converse influence. In other words, the relativity Sapir spoke of might best be termed “cultural relativity” rather than “linguistic relativity”. Nevertheless he did suggest that one’s language could directly constrain her/his thoughts, for example when he noted that “the ‘real world’ is to a large extent unconsciously built up on the language habits of the group.” (Sapir [1949 (1929)]:162) However, in the same work Sapir spoke of language as operating as a “guide” to culture, and elsewhere his writings suggest that language serves to create a common understanding that constitutes culture. In short, while Sapir spoke of relativity of thought, his relevant work was predominantly oriented towards cultural disparity being the primary effector of relativity, with language serving as crucial symbolic guide to cultures. Furthermore, unlike Whorf, Sapir’s discussions of the influences of language on thought, like the work of his predecessors, are somewhat devoid of specifics. He does not discuss in detail any cases or

illustrations of the relativity he envisions, and his perspective on the relevant issues is more nebulous than that of his student. After all, Sapir was not attempting to draft some sort of testable linguistic relativity hypothesis. In touching on this issue, he was in large measure attempting (like Boas) to argue against a simplistic view of linguistic-cultural co-evolution that was so prevalent during his day, and which had been made prevalent in the work of previous influential researchers such as Humboldt. This perspective held, among other oversimplifications, that inflectional morphologies exhibited a positive correlation with more “advanced” cultural features, and was used by some to buttress the legitimization of the notion that some languages and cultures represented earlier evolutionary stages. This misappropriation of the tenets of evolution was objected to by Boas (1966[1911]) and Sapir, who stressed the need to actually examine the complex structural systems evident in indigenous languages, particularly those in the Americas they devoted much of their lives to documenting. In short, Boas and Sapir were both believers in the theoretical existence of a basic “psychic unity of mankind,” who nevertheless apparently felt that fleshing out our understanding of this unity required clear documentations of the numerous complex languages in existence. The clear delineation of any relativity hypothesis seems to have been, at best, tangential to Sapir’s aims. Some of his work is consonant with the subsequent formulations of the notion, though–most notably when he suggests that certain categories reflected in particular languages “are not so much discovered in experience as imposed upon it because of the tyrannical hold that linguistic form has upon our orientation in the world.” (1964[1931]:138)
Only in Whorf’s work is linguistic relativity formulated as a cohesive, or nearly cohesive, set of ideas regarding the influence of different languages on the thoughts of their speakers. Whorf addressed this issue with a greater deal of specificity than had been observed in the literature, and was the first author to develop concrete and specific examples of how features of particular languages putatively generated more widespread effects on the cognitive processes of their speakers (see Lucy [1992a, 1996]). Many of these examples have been the subject of criticism in the intervening years. Nevertheless, Whorf’s ideas on the subject captured the fancy of many, and had a profound effect on the work of other researchers, including many contemporary ones whose work is the real subject of this book. So we will restrict the remainder of our discussion of the origins of linguistic relativity as a coherent concept to Whorf’s work, bearing in mind the close relationship of that work to that of his immediate predecessors, most notably Sapir.
Whorf was a chemical engineer who, despite years of expressed interest in linguistics, only began formal studies on the subject (at Yale, with Sapir) at

the age of 31, and who only lived another ten years beyond that point. Yet, contrary to the inaccurate characterizations sometimes offered, Whorf was not simply an “amateur” linguist. In fact, he was a remarkably productive scholar who published in major linguistic journals while contributing in important ways to a variety of linguistic sub-fields. A very influential collection of his work was published posthumously (Whorf [1956]). It is worth mentioning that much of this work was not related to the topic of linguistic relativity, and included extensive studies of Hopi and Nahuatl grammar, as well as work on Maya hieroglyphs. For an extremely comprehensive treatment of Whorf’s work, as well as some important biographical background, see Lee (1996).
Among the most frequently cited selections from Whorf’s work on the subject is the following, which represents the first clear formulation employing the term “linguistic relativity”: “From this pact proceeds what I have called the ‘linguistic relativity principle,’2 which means, in informal terms, that users of markedly different grammars are pointed by the grammars toward different types of observations and different evaluations of externally similar acts of observation, and hence are not equivalent as observers but must arrive at somewhat different views of the world.” (1956:221)
Lest one assume that the diversity of observations highlighted by different grammars was of a trivial sort, consider the following (also-well-known) excerpt: “Are our own concepts of ‘time,’ space,’ and ‘matter’ given in substantially the same form by experience to all men, or are they in part conditioned by the structure of particular languages? Are there traceable affinities between (a) cultural and behavioral norms and (b) large-scale linguistic patterns?” (1956:138) Aside from the clear Einsteinian homage in the discussion of these ideas vis-à-vis a relativity of “time”, “space”, and “matter”, what strikes one about this excerpt is the gravity of the relativity propounded by Whorf. He suggests that the perception of some very fundamental concepts may be influenced by language. Such a suggestion may seem extreme, and was uncorroborated in Whorf’s work. However, that work hinted at ways in which corroboration might be achieved, and it is interesting to note that recent work has now provided data that are consistent with Whorf’s ideas that even the conceptualization of space (see Chapter 4 of this text), time (Chapter 5), and matter (Chapter 8) are in fact affected by linguistic patterns. This is not to suggest that the

2 Note that Whorf did not refer to the linguistic relativity “hypothesis”, as noted in Lee (1996) and Scholz, Pelletier, and Pullum (2011). Instead he discussed the “principle” of linguistic relativity. According to the analysis in Lee (1996), this principle was one of several crucial principles in Whorf’s larger “theory complex” on the nature of linguistic thought. For a synopsis of the twelve major points in that complex, see Lee (1996:30–33).

relevant research has served simply to vindicate Whorf’s claims, since his claims regarding the domains in question were not particularly concrete or specific.
Perhaps the most famous comments by Whorf on the matter are the following:
The categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do not find there because they stare every observer in the face; on the contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscopic flux of impressions which has to be organized in our minds – and this means largely by the linguistic systems in our minds. We cut nature up, organize it into concepts, and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this way – an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of our language. (1956:213)
These comments, it should be noted, have often been misinterpreted or overinterpreted in the intervening years. They have often been taken as being suggestive of a particularly strong sort of linguistic determinism, according to which speakers are incapable of loosing the linguistic handcuffs placed upon them during infancy. Such interpretations are generally inconsistent with the bulk of Whorf’s work, however (see Lucy [1992a]), though when read in isolation these comments do not seem far afield from a strongly deterministic perspective. Regardless, we are interested in Whorf’s perspective as it relates to the notion of linguistic relativity, i.e. the idea that systematic differences across languages lead to differences in nonlinguistic cognition, differences that are not necessarily impossible to overcome. We are not concerned with the notion of linguistic determinism, which is simply the idea that one’s thoughts are completely governed by her/his native language.
By now it is hopefully clear what Whorf meant by linguistic relativity, at least in general terms. In the years since Whorf’s work, the popularity of linguistic relativity has waxed and waned in large measure in accordance with the popularity of over-arching paradigms in the social sciences. So Whorf’s work was met with initial enthusiasm at a time when behaviorism was prominent, and not surprisingly this enthusiasm dwindled with the rise of nativism, most notably the nativist Chomskyan paradigm in linguistics. (Though the Chomskyan framework is not necessarily incompatible with the Whorf’s principle of relativity–see discussion in Scholz, Pelletier, and Pullum [2011].) The hypothesis was particularly prone to shifts in paradigmatic winds since little convincing evidence was presented on its behalf, either by Whorf or by any other proponents of the idea, prior to the last decade or so of the twentieth century. Which is not to suggest that Whorf presented no evidence in support of linguistic relativity. Next we briefly consider the most widely circulated exemplifications of relativity offered by Whorf, with the caveat that these

examples are not being endorsed here as evidence for the hypothesis. They represent instead cases that may be taken to support the relativistic position on a less rigorous, more intuitive, plane. The examples fall into two broad types of relativistic effects according to which the divergent structures of semantic systems in contrasted languages supposedly influence their speakers’ thoughts.
One type of evidence presented by Whorf related to the way in which languages “dissect nature differently” (1956:208). This sort of evidence was offered prominently in his papers entitled “Science and linguistics” (1940), “Language and logic” (1941), and “Language, mind and reality” (1941), all included in Carroll’s compendium (Whorf [1956]). In “Science and Linguistics”, he offers several cases not too dissimilar from the examples I offered above based on my own personal experience (and not much more rigorously either). In such cases, one language offers several lexical items or categories, including verbal and nominal ones, for a set of distinctions that are apparently not coded in another language. For example, Whorf notes that the Hopi have one noun for flying things besides birds, and that this noun can refer to insects, aviators, or airplanes. The assumption here seems to be that Hopi speakers conceive of flying entities in a dissimilar (more unified?) way than English speakers, perhaps like English speakers seem to conceive of certain soccer maneuvers in a different (more unified?) manner when contrasted with Brazilian Portuguese speakers. Note that no actual evidence was provided for either claim.
Another parallel example was employed by Whorf, and this example (perhaps unfortunately) came to be the poster child for linguistic relativity. Specifically, Whorf (in)famously contrasted the number of words for snow in English and Eskimo, a subject that had received some attention in Boas’ work (1966[1911]:21–22). Whorf stated that:
We have the same word for falling snow, snow on the ground, snow packed hard like ice, slushy snow, wind-driven flying snow – whatever the situation may be. To an Eskimo, this all-inclusive word would be almost unthinkable; he would say that falling snow, slushy snow, and so on, are sensuously and operationally different, different things to contend with; he uses different words for them and for other kinds of snow. The Aztecs go even farther than we in the opposite direction, with ‘cold,’ ‘ice,’ and ‘snow’ all represented by the same basic word with different terminations; ‘iced’ is the noun form; ‘cold’ the adjectival form; and for ‘snow,’ “ice mist.” (1956:216)
There are several well-known issues with this claim, not the least of which is that Whorf makes claims about Eskimo nonlinguistic cognition based entirely on linguistic evidence. One gets the idea of the sort of cognitive disparity being hinted at, though, of the same ilk as that hinted at by the lexical disparities

between Karitiâna and English vis-à-vis basic terms for “monkey” and its hyponyms.
We might call this sort of relativistic influence a “categorization” effect, according to which the way in which a particular semantic field is divided up in a given language impacts the ontological ratiocination of its speakers. Judging from Whorf’s examples, one of the corollaries of this proposed effect is that speakers with a greater number of basic lexical items for a given semantic field construe that semantic field in more precise or discriminating ways than speakers lacking such terms. In the cited section above, for example, the explicit claim is made that Eskimos perceive falling snow and slushy snow to be “sensuously and operationally different.” The only evidence presented in support of this claim is the fact that such concepts can be teased apart lexically with greater ease in Eskimo. The claim for divergent sensory and operational experiences of snow across the two groups in question is not further substantiated. Nevertheless, we get the sense of what Whorf is claiming regarding these “categorization” type effects, viz. that greater perceptual refinement is implied by more detailed lexical demarcations between portions of a given semantic domain.
Another well-known example of such a categorization type of relativistic effect is Whorf’s claim that the means for coding temporal concepts are limited in Hopi, when contrasted with English. Here the categorization effect in question is grammatical, rather than lexical, but it nevertheless denotes a particular semantic domain that is split in different ways across the languages in question. According to Whorf, “Hopi may be called a timeless language” (1956:216), in large measure because “the Hopi verb gets along without tenses” (217). Setting aside Whorf’s oversimplification of the ways in which Hopi speakers denote temporal deixis, the implication is that the types of categories evident in the English tense system affect its speakers’ conceptions of time in a way that is unfamiliar to Hopi speakers. Among other distinctions, the three-fold “past”, “present”, and “future” distinction in English and other European languages helps to yield, according to Whorf, a greater objectification of time that enables speakers to imagine time as the occurrence of sequential “units” in ways not possible (or at least quite difficult) for Hopi speakers. (See Whorf [1956]:143–145, 216–218 for a more detailed account).
Another example of the sort of “categorization” effects offered by Whorf is the count-mass nominal distinction evident in some languages. As Whorf notes, in “Standard Average European” the distinction between count and mass nouns is evident in pluralization strategies, e.g. “mass nouns lack plurals, in English drop particles, and in French take the article du, de la, des.” (1956:140) Significantly, Whorf suggests, the division of matter into two broad

17

categories of countable and non-countable entities does not actually reflect natural categories. Aside from a handful of cases such as air, sand, and water, “few natural occurrences present themselves as unbounded events” (1956:141). The net result of Standard Average European’s rigid division between count and mass nouns is, according to Whorf, that this distinction is forced upon speakers’ perceptions of types of matter. Conversely, Hopi speakers are free to perceive matter types without this particular enforcement of categories since their language “contains no formal subclass of mass nouns.” (1956:141)
The preceding examples illustrate the sorts of categorization-type effects suggested by Whorf in his examinations of the ways in which disparate languages split various semantic fields, supposedly yielding correlated splits in conceptual patterns. There are issues with these particular categorization-type effects, as scholars have noted subsequent to Whorf’s work. Nevertheless these sorts of examples did strike a chord with many readers, and continue to do so. And while Whorf’s examples are largely unsubstantiated by the desirable nonlinguistic corroboration, research related to those examples is now being undertaken, for instance on the nonlinguistic classification of kinds of matter (see chapter 8).
The other principal sort of relativistic effect suggested by Whorf and discussed in detail in “The Relation of Habitual Thought and Behavior to Language”, first published in 1941 and also included in Carroll’s collection, might be termed an “analogy-based” effect. This type of relativistic effect can be further sub-categorized into lexical and grammatical analogies (see Lucy [1992a] for a detailed discussion). Whorf’s most well known illustration of this sort of effect is a lexical analogy that putatively results in a perceptual effect for English speakers who use the word “empty”.
During his employ with the Hartford Fire Insurance Company, Whorf analyzed hundreds of reports regarding the manner in which particular fires started. He believed these reports suggested that individuals were more careful around storage units labeled “gasoline drums” than those labeled “empty gasoline drums.” (1956:135) Assuming Whorf’s claim is correct (he provides no systematic analysis of the reports), this is a noteworthy correlation since it is plausibly explained by linguistic factors. In his words:
Thus, around a storage of what are called “gasoline drums,” behavior will tend to a certain type, that is, great care will be exercised; while around a storage of what are called “empty gasoline drums,” it will tend to be different – careless, with little repression of smoking or of tossing cigarette stubs about. Yet the “empty” drums are perhaps the more dangerous, since they contain explosive vapor. Physically the situation is hazardous, but the linguistic analysis according to regular analogy must employ the word ‘empty,’ which inevitably suggests lack of hazard. (1956:135)

18

Contextualizing the issues

Now the word “empty” can be used in a strict manner that is synonymous with “null and void, negative, inert” (1956:135). It can also be used in a more colloquial manner, though, according to which something is empty but no claims regarding vapor are implied. If I say a barrel (or gas tank or suitcase or room…) is empty, for instance, there is typically no implication that the all gases such as oxygen have been vacuumed out. This duplicity of meaning leads to analogy-based behavior that would presumably not be observed in the behavior of speakers of other languages without the distinction. If a gasoline drum is labeled in a colloquial manner in which no implication of vapor absence is assumed, but encountered in another environment in which the label is interpreted strictly, the results are dangerous according to Whorf. The contents of the barrel are often perceived, by way of an analogy (or simply a misinterpretation) based on a slightly different definition of the word, as lacking all contents including hazardous ones. As a result, suggests Whorf, workers around “empty” gas drums behave carelessly at times, as though no vapors were contained in the drums. There is a prediction here: Workers who do not speak English or any other language that facilitates the sort of analogical reasoning characterized above might exhibit safer behavior in such contexts. The clear implication of such an example, and of other similar ones (see Whorf [1956:135], as well as Carroll [1956:29–30] for discussion), is that nonlinguistic behavior in such cases is conditioned in large part by one’s native language.
Whorf presented numerous examples of analogy-type effects and categorization-type effects in his work. Those described above are illustrative of the sorts of relativistic effects he claimed to exist. In short, he believed that any language is systematically structured in its semantics, and that this structure has demonstrable effects on speakers’ nonlinguistic categorization and perception. (Whorf 1956:252) This structuring is enforced by overt and covert linguistic categories, sometimes termed “phenotypes” and “cryptotypes”, respectively. Even in the few examples of Whorf’s discussed above, it is clear that such systematically structured categories could be lexical or grammatical in nature. Crosslinguistic dissimilarities in lexical or grammatical categories, according to his account, result in correlated behavioral and cognitive dissimilarity. It should be stressed that Whorf never suggested that these effects completely determine speakers’ thoughts in a manner that results in cognitive incommensurability across populations (Kay and Kempton [1984:76–77]).
Whorf’s work was crucial to the establishment of linguistic relativity as a viable concept, and there is much in contemporary research on the topic that owes itself to his relevant ideas. Yet it would also be inaccurate to see the current body of research as connected to that of Whorf in an unbroken fashion, or to see that work as being based primarily on Whorf’s ideas. In fact, the

current research differs dramatically from Whorf’s, in large measure according to methodological parameters that will crystallize during the course of this book but might be pithily encapsulated as follows: the current crop of studies on this topic is based predominantly on experimental work involving nonlinguistic tasks and carried out with speakers of two or more languages. In contrast, Whorf did not conduct any experimental tests on human cognition or behavior. His work was foundational in offering up directions to be followed in future research, and presenting tentative examples that hinted at languageinfluenced habitual thought. These tentative examples went unsubstantiated in his work though. This is not meant as a criticism of Whorf (after all, he died shortly after drafting some of his original hypotheses), merely as a note on the history of this research.
Gumperz and Levinson (1996:24) summarize the linguistic relativity hypothesis, in its most schematic form, with the following syllogism:3
Given that: (1) differences exist in linguistic categories across languages; (2) linguistic categories determine aspects of individuals’ thinking; then: (3) aspects of individuals’ thinking differ across linguistic communities according to the
language they speak.
Now if both (1) and (2) hold, then of course (modus ponens), (3) must also hold. This syllogistic reasoning is evident in Whorf’s work, though not explicitly. Evidence for (3) is only now accruing, however, and the extent to which (1) and (2) hold remains a matter of some debate among linguists and others. Yet it is worth stressing that it is difficult to object to (1) and (2) in an absolute manner. Even the most ardent believer in a universal grammar must admit that some differences exist in linguistic categories across languages (even if they do not believe that these differences are particularly meaningful), and certainly it is difficult to avoid the conclusion, with even a modest amount of introspection, that linguistic categories determine aspects of thinking (even if one believes these to be superficial aspects of thinking that are only required for online linguistic processing). To a large extent, then, the question at hand is not whether (1) or (2) hold, but to what degree they hold. How significant are crosslinguistic differences? How impactful are such categories upon thought, and do they influence forms of thought beyond those directly related to constructing and deconstructing utterances?

3 This can be contrasted with the more specific formulation of the Whorfian hypothesis syllogism (Gumperz and Levinson [1996:25]).

20

Contextualizing the issues

Assuming (1) and (2) hold to some degree, however minor, our attention should naturally gravitate towards (3). How does individuals’ thinking differ across linguistic communities? Is there evidence for very weak or trivial differences only? Or is there evidence for significant disparities in nonlinguistic cognition that can clearly be tied to the linguistic practices of individual communities? Or does the evidence fall somewhere in between these points? Surprisingly, in the several decades following Whorf’s work there was remarkably little research undertaken to empirically address these questions, despite the fact that the acceptance of the relativistic hypothesis naturally hinges upon their answers. The absence of relevant research is particularly surprising given how popular Whorfianism became in some academic and non-academic circles, and also given how virulently it was opposed in other circles. As Levinson (2003) notes, it became a subject that many people were happy to weigh in on while vigorously attacking ideological opponents, while concomitantly adding little in the way of substantive data that could actually elucidate some of the relevant issues.
In many ways, empirical research on linguistic relativity was not taken up in earnest until the early-to-mid 1990’s, most prominently in the work of John Lucy (1992b) and Stephen Levinson (1996). In this book, I take such influential works as the trigger for the explosion of serious inquiries into linguistic relativity. This is not to suggest that related research (e.g. Kay and Kempton [1984], Bloom [1981]) had not been carried out prior to that time. In fact, a number of relevant studies did surface in the linguistics and anthropology literature in the intervening decades, i.e. following Whorf’s work and prior to the work of Lucy, Levinson, and a number of their colleagues mentioned in this book. With few exceptions, though, these works did not advance work on linguistic relativity empirically, and they most frequently did not generate much interest outside their specific sub-field. They often relied on linguistic data alone, and lacked data demonstrating cross-population differences in cognition, that is, they did not address point (3) in the above syllogism. Among these works, which were quite laudable in other respects, were Lee (1944) and Mathiot (1962). I refer the reader to Lucy (1992a) for a discussion of these studies as they relate to the relativity hypothesis. It is worth noting also that, during the latter part of the 20th century, cross-cultural psychology developed into a serious area of inquiry, with its flagship journal being founded in 1970. Unfortunately perhaps, most linguists remained unaware of related developments in this field and there was little cross-pollination of ideas between the fields. As a result, few studies in cross-cultural psychology impinged directly on the issue of linguistic relativity. Thankfully, that characterization is no longer accurate though it could be argued that linguistically motivated differences in psychology across cultures still receive insufficient attention.

A brief history of the linguistic relativity hypothesis

21

The motivations for the decades-long delay in the start-up of the relevant research are multifarious. One significant development that contributed to the delay was the arrival of the generativist paradigm during this period. The acceptance of this paradigm seems to have played a role in leading many researchers to ignore the topic of linguistic relativity on theoretical grounds. Chomsky’s (1965) influential work led many linguists to focus their attention on developing the most parsimonious theoretical treatments possible for “surface-level” crosslinguistic variation, reducing such differences to a limited set of features of a universal grammar. In some sense linguistic homogeneity became a greater focus than linguistic diversity. Practically, the universalist and innatist perspective allowed linguists to rely extensively on native-speaker elicitations, and arguably obfuscated the need for the methodological tools associated with other branches of the cognitive sciences, for instance the generation of experimental results and statistical tests on those results. (These sorts of tools are central to the works on relativity discussed in this book.) Furthermore, the belief held by many researchers that grammars are fundamentally alike seems to have devalued the need for detailed grammars of unrelated languages described on their own terms, i.e. without the encumbrances of a theoretical perspective that presumed some sort of deep-level uniformity across languages. Regardless, data on significant crosslinguistic variation (see Chapter 2), which were less and less amenable to a strong universalist account, continued to surface during the second half of the 20th century–particularly data gathered in areas such as Amazonia, New Guinea, the Caucasus, and Australia. These data contributed to numerous substantive shifts and splits in the universalist linguistic paradigm (e.g. Chomsky [1980], [1995], Pinker and Jackendoff [2005]), to the complete disenchantment of previous proponents of such an approach (e.g. Lakoff [1987], D. Everett [2005]), and to the waning influence of the universalist perspective evident today. Which is not to suggest that this perspective does not still maintain strong influence in some circles, as it clearly does.
Despite the theoretical obstacle of linguistic universalism, which gained strength shortly after the publication of Carroll’s collection of Whorf’s works, essential theoretical developments that were complimentary to the linguistic relativity hypothesis were also disseminated during this time, both in linguistics and in related fields. For instance, Vygotsky’s (1962[1934]) influential work demonstrated the centrality of language in conceptual development. Similarly, work on semantics by authors such as Bowerman (1978) helped lead many researchers to re-focus on the semantic disparities across languages. Furthermore, linguistic anthropologists such as Silverstein (1979) and Hymes (1966) developed influential theoretical frameworks for the study of language, cul-

ture, and thought that invited rather than discouraged work on the issue, while addressing linguistic relativity at the theoretical level and demonstrating ways in which crosslinguistic variation impacts the indexical nature of communication. Within what might be termed by some “linguistics” proper, a number of very influential scholars remained devoted to exploring grammatical description and typology from a functionally and cognitively oriented perspective that did not assume universalism. These scholars include Givón (1984), Bybee (1985), Langacker (1991) and Comrie (1981).
All of these non-universalist strands of research ultimately contributed in one way or another to current inquiries into linguistic relativity, which were more directly triggered by the work of Lucy, Levinson, and their colleagues. This inquiry has been referred to occasionally as a “resurgence” of Whorfianism, or as “neo-Whorfianism”. In many ways it is not a resurgence, however, but a re-envisioning of what work on this topic should consist of. The research described in this book is not modeled specifically after Whorf’s, after all. It relates to some of the issues he drew attention to, but it is very non-Whorfian methodologically. Approaches to the subject are constantly evolving and being impacted by the work of numerous parties in related fields of the cognitive sciences. In this book we will avoid the association of research on linguistic relativity with labels bearing the names of particular researchers such as Whorf. Such terms increase the odds that the research will be judged not on its own merits, but on the merits of work from another era that differed in many significant respects. I will refer instead simply to work on “linguistic relativity”, the hypothesis that crosslinguistic differences have any demonstrable effects on nonlinguistic cognition (Lucy 1997:295). More specific formulations of this general hypothesis are taken to be mutable, changing in accordance with our increasing understanding of the strength and pervasiveness, or lack thereof, of relativistic effects.

1.4 Motivations for criticisms of the hypothesis
There are many reasons that the linguistic relativity hypothesis failed to gain traction during the latter half of the 20th century, some of which were touched on in the preceding section. In many cases the relevant studies produced were susceptible to valid methodological criticisms, which our discussion has so far hinted at but not fully explored. Some of these criticisms have been crucial in shaping the research surveyed in this book. Other points have been less influential since, we will argue, they resulted from misperceptions of some relativistic claims.

Motivations for criticisms of the hypothesis

23

Perhaps the most prominent problem characterizing work on relativity, particularly much of Whorf’s work and a number of other studies in the subsequent decades, is simple circularity. This circularity is the by-product of the choice to employ one sort of linguistic data in support of a hypothesis based on another sort of linguistic data, all the while making claims about nonlinguistic behavior and thought (see discussion in Enfield [2000]). Consider Whorf’s claims regarding numerous categorization-type effects, for instance the way in which water is thought of by Hopi and English speakers. English has a general word for ‘water’, whereas according to Whorf Hopi has two words for the relevant substance. One of these is employed for naturally occurring water (pahe), e.g. in lakes, waterfalls, rivers, etc., while the other is utilized when water is contained (keyi) in cups, bottles, ladles, and the like (1956:210). The different words for water are suggestive of differences in thought. Yet what evidence do we have for this difference of thought? We are offered nothing in this case beyond the linguistic data. If we want to convince skeptics that Hopi and English speakers actually think differently about water, however, we would need some correlation between the differences in linguistic taxonomy and actual behavior outside of language. In short, there must be testable predictions beyond the linguistic realm, and the reliance on data in the linguistic realm to support a hypothesis generated on those same linguistic data is patently circular. Furthermore, the utilization of linguistic data only runs the risk of ignoring parallel expressions that might reflect greater crosslinguistic similarity (see Kay 1996). In this case for, example, while there may be a basic cover term for ‘water’ in English there is also an assortment of other words that distinguish between types of water. I can, for instance, speak of “spring water” and “tap water”. While both terms contain the cover term ‘water’, can we really be confident that English speakers do not distinguish kinds of water in finegrained ways like that hinted at by the different terms for water in Hopi? The point here is not that they do or do not, but merely to illustrate how linguistic data alone offer insufficient support for such claims. Relativistic claims can only avoid circularity if we provide evidence for cognitive differences through some nonlinguistic behavior. Differentiated lexical encoding of a given semantic category does not reflect, a priori, differentiated nonlexical conceptualizations of the relevant category.
A second objection to the relativistic position is that it is particularly susceptible to confirmation bias. That is, researchers are more prone to interpret findings, even nonlinguistic data of some kind, in ways that confirm their hypotheses. Part of the reason claims related to linguistic relativity have been so susceptible to such a bias is that they have frequently been anecdotal in nature. For example, consider the example I offered above regarding the per-

ception of monkey types by speakers of Karitiâna and English, respectively. Now the absence of a superordinate term for monkey in Karitiâna may reflect some important conceptual distinction between particular species of monkey types, and it may help to enforce that distinction in the minds of Karitiâna speakers in a way that English does not. Yet what nonlinguistic data do I have to support this claim? I mentioned above that there seem to be clear behavioral differences of the two populations vis-à-vis monkeys, and that Karitiâna speakers prefer the stew made out of some monkey types, for example. This sort of anecdotal data is problematic though since it is not systematically or objectively gathered, and as a result may be chosen, subconsciously or not, precisely because it supports my hypothesis. Maybe there are aspects of Karitiâna behavior that are consistent with the notion that all monkey types are conceptually grouped. I do not know of any, but I must admit the possibility that my attention is naturally drawn to the ways in which the Karitiâna clearly distinguish between monkey species because of the way I have interpreted the linguistic data, and therefore the possibility exists that I am paying less attention to behavioral data that may contradict my hypothesis. My claims are potentially susceptible to confirmation bias, no matter how strongly I feel about them based on personal experience with the people. In order to provide convincing evidence, such claims cannot rely on either linguistic or anecdotal evidence alone. It is worth stressing, though, that the same point holds for those skeptical of claims for linguistic relativity. Those believing that linguistic disparities do not impact nonlinguistic cognition must offer experimental, non-anecdotal, evidence for the absence of relativistic effects – at least if their position is to be defended on empirical grounds.
This brings us to the third and potentially the most serious criticism of this sort of work, which must be taken into account for claims on linguistic relativity to hold water. For lack of a better term, let me refer to this as the “apparent inextricability of linguistic influences on thought”. Language is perhaps the most unique component of culture, the shared set of behaviors of a particular group of humans, and is crucial to the transmission and negotiation of many nonlinguistic components of culture. However prominent it might be, though, language does not represent the entirety of culture. There are aspects of culture that are clearly nonlinguistic, or that have rather tenuous ligatures to language. With this in mind, let us assume that we have established differences in some aspect of the cognition of two groups of humans, say a group of American college students and an aboriginal Australian population whose spatial orientation strategies differ markedly. Furthermore, let us assume that there are clear differences between the spatial orientation terms employed in the two groups’ languages, and that these differences are consistent with the

groups’ demonstrated disparities in nonlinguistic spatial orientation. This is an interesting finding, one that is certainly consistent with a relativistic interpretation. But, bearing in mind the truism that correlation cannot be equated with causation, another interpretation remains. Perhaps the linguistic and cognitive data are consistent because of a more general cultural factor, one that is evident in nonlinguistic spatial orientation and also in the linguistic encoding of space. Now we might believe that linguistic behavior plays a major role in constraining the spatial orientation strategies of the two groups in question, but how do we extricate that role from a potentially more basic cultural factor that serves as a confounding variable? Methodologically, this is not a simple task. In some cases it may in fact be impossible. Yet as we will see there are ways this apparent inextricability of linguistic influence can be overcome, at least in large measure.
The three issues delineated above must be carefully taken into account in work on linguistic relativity, and are generally at least tacitly acknowledged by contemporary researchers. They have been addressed methodologically, with varying degrees of success, by many of the studies described in this book. They have not always been considered carefully, however, in discussions of linguistic relativity, and have therefore served as impetus for warranted criticisms of the hypothesis. In addition to these three substantive motivations for criticism of the hypothesis, there has been another more trivial (or more precisely, trivializing) motivation, namely exaggeration.
Some claims on linguistic relativity are based at least in some part on the exaggeration of differences between languages. Perhaps the most famous documentable case of hyperbole relates to the aforementioned disparity between number of words for snow in Eskimo and English. Pullum (1991:163) notes that Whorf’s claim is based on an exaggeration of Boas’s description of Eskimo words. According to Boas’s (1966[1911]) description, Eskimo contains four words for snow, but Whorf “illicitly inflated” (1991:163) that number to seven (on Pullum’s count) while also glossing over the varied sorts of words for snow in English (e.g. sleet, slush, snow…). In that sense Whorf was guilty of both the confirmation bias discussed above (by ignoring parallel translations in English), while also being guilty of exaggerating the actual Eskimo data. As Pullum humorously notes, however, Whorf’s data then formed the basis of second-hand and third-hand (Eastman [1975]) discussions on the subject. The net result has been the popularization of claims that the Eskimos have “one hundred” (New York Times, Feburary 9, 1984) or more words for snow. Such claims are clearly apocryphal, though, and reflect a serious distortion of any actual linguistic data.
Judging from our discussion to this point, the motivations for criticisms of research on linguistic relativity are largely methodological. These issues must

26

Contextualizing the issues

be taken into account if claims on the subject are to be taken seriously. It is worth underscoring, though, that the criticisms of many claims regarding linguistic relativity, both in the past and present, have often related in equal measure to aspects of the intellectual climate in which the research was or is received.
Many of Whorf’s central points were initially accepted by a variety of social scientists, at least in part because of the common empiricist epistemology and behaviorism of the time. Shortly after the publication of the collection of Whorf’s works (1956), however, there was a radical shift in the dominant ideology in linguistics, as discussed in the preceding section. The nativist linguistic theory popularized at that time appeared incompatible with the idea that linguistic disparities foster any sort of significant cognitive disparities. After all, how can such relativistic effects exist if there are no significant fundamental disparities across languages, that is, if languages share a universal grammar? More specifically, how can grammatical dissimilarities yield conceptual dissimilarities if all grammatical dissimilarities are ascribed to surface, non-“deep structure” phenomena only? Furthermore, if language is modular and detached from other cognitive processes in the way implied by the prominent nativism of the time, what extant mechanisms could allow language to influence nonlinguistic thought?
Significantly, the strong nativism that pervaded linguistics during much of the second half of the twentieth century (see discussion in Landau and Jackendoff [1993]) operated synergistically with some consonant contemporary developments in psychology. Some of the more significant strains of thought here were the nativist and modular approaches lobbied for in works such as Fodor (1975, 1983)4, Piaget (1955, 1977) and more recently in Keller and Keller (1996). The details of the approaches characterized by such works are not altogether relevant here, though it is crucial to note that these influential frameworks are generally consistent with a unidirectional sort of influence of thought processes on language, rather than vice-versa.5 Given a climate in which such nativism held sway, claims on linguistic relativity faced theoretical obstacles to serious consideration by many in the cognitive sciences. The skepticism towards relativity was in some cases voiced explicitly, for instance in Clark and Clark (1977) and Devitt and Sterelny (1987). It is somewhat surpris-

4 The modularity characterized in these works has given way to the massive modularity evident for instance in Pinker (2007), as well as weaker forms of the modularity hypothesis, e.g. Gibbs and Van Orden (2010). Note that Fodor himself does not advocate the massive modularity perspective (see Fodor [1998]). 5 Which is not to say that such perspectives admit no possibility of any relativistic effects. See e.g. Fodor (1975:389).

ing, though, that the universalist perspectives popular during much of this period were sometimes taken to be inherently anti-relativistic, since proponents of linguistic relativity do not maintain that no aspects of cognition or language might be universal or native. Even Whorf (1956:239) noted that language was “in some sense a superficial embroidery upon deeper processes of consciousness.” Put differently, acceptance of significant linguistic diversity, along with associated cognitive effects of such diversity, does not imply the non-acceptance of universal aspects of human cognition. Given how much humans share genetically, most contemporary researchers presume a fair amount of universalism in human cognition. Many feel, however, that the extent of that universalism is an empirical matter that requires exploration. Proponents of linguistic relativity believe that this exploration will allow us to better establish which facets of human cognition are in fact susceptible to variance, perhaps due to linguistic influence. Socio-cultural and linguistic contexts of the acquisition of knowledge were to some extent de-emphasized by the popular nativist approaches mentioned above, and one of the by-products of this de-emphasis was that serious research on relativity was undervalued by many language researchers, some of whom were in fact theoretically adversarial to such work.
These various hindrances to work on linguistic relativity characterized much of the research climate of the latter half of the 20th century. They do not characterize the current climate, however, at least not to the same degree. Which is not to suggest that research on the subject does not face ideological opposition in some quarters. Much of this opposition doest not actually stem from familiarity with current work on linguistic relativity, but results instead from the wholesale association of the linguistic relativity hypothesis with the work of Whorf, which as we have noted is not immune to serious methodological criticisms. More troublingly, given the frequent exaggeration and distortion of some of Whorf’s claims, work on linguistic relativity is sometimes characterized by distortions of Whorf’s perspective itself, for instance in the oft-cited work of Pinker (1994). As Monaghan (2011:227) notes, the “ongoing distance between popular notions of Whorf and his legacy as seen from within linguistic anthropology is something members of the field continually attempt to correct.” One could argue, though, that such attempts at correction represent a misappropriation of energies. That is, researchers in some cases have focused significant exegetical efforts on defending Whorf’s actual intents. While it is disappointing to see any scholar’s work grossly misinterpreted, though, in some sense Whorfian hermeneutics are immaterial to the contemporary discussions of linguistic relativity, which should be shaped not by his work but by the wealth of research presently being generated with an eye toward address-

28

Contextualizing the issues

ing the issues outlined above. As Deutscher (2010) notes, evidence against the strongest Whorfian claims has incorrectly been “taken as proof that people of all cultures think in fundamentally the same way.” As the same writer points out, though, this is surely a mistake. So, rather than defending the original claims of Whorf, proponents of the linguistic relativity hypothesis might be best served by drawing attention to contemporary claims that are more wellgrounded empirically. In doing so, perhaps some ideological opponents will engage more seriously with the topic of linguistic relativity.
Finally, in discussing issues that are troublesome to the linguistic relativity hypothesis, we should mention a political factor. As scholars have previously noted (Fishman [1982], Lakoff [1987:337]), admitting the possibility of cognitive disparities due to crosslinguistic factors allows for radical viewpoints according to which some linguistic features are seen as resulting in more complex/ advanced thought patterns. Such admission runs the risk of effacing cognitive similarities across groups of people, and exaggerating cognitive differences in simplistic terms. While most linguists and other cognitive scientists are not out to simplify and/or politicize their results, popular interpretations of such results may run that risk, as evidenced by claims regarding Eskimo words for snow. Exaggerated interpretations of data that distort the degree of cognitive dissonance across cultures are obviously not desirable. Yet it is worth noting as well that, from the perspective of many, linguistics and cognitive science more generally has suffered considerably from the superficial attention sometimes paid to profound kinds of linguistic diversity. If we are truly concerned with understanding human language and human cognition, surely we must by necessity be concerned with the evidence for diversity of these two phenomena across human populations. We need to better understand the observable ranges of these sorts of diversity, and any documentable correlations between them. Put differently, to advance our understanding of the role that language might play in “the mediation of culture and mind” (Lucy 2004:1), we must be willing to acknowledge the possibility of diversity in human cognition across populations. The acknowledgement of such diversity does not after all imply any simplistic conclusions regarding variant complexity or desirability vis-àvis the diverse patterns in question.

1.5 Issues with some prominent criticisms
In addition to the warranted methodological and disputable ideological motivations for objections to linguistic relativity, some well-known objections are based on more tenuous motivations. More specifically, some objections are based on caricaturizations of the relativistic position.

Issues with some prominent criticisms

29

Consider perhaps the best known attack on the relativistic position, Pinker’s (1994) so-called “obituary” for linguistic relativity (see also his discussion of the “Whorfian hypothesis” in Pinker [2007:126–28]). Pinker (1994:57) posits that the hypothesis of linguistic relativity, which he defines as the notion “that differences among languages cause differences in the thoughts of their speakers” is “wrong, all wrong.” This is a strong claim, yet in substantiating the claim Pinker fixates on an entirely different claim, one that is in fact objectionable: “The idea that thought is the same as language”. In other words, he equates the latter Orwellian claim (see discussion in Casasanto [2008]) with the relativistic position. The caricaturization allows for a facile assault of the relativistic position. It is clear, after all, that thought is not isomorphic with language. Not even in Whorf’s work is the claim made that thought and language are entirely dissociable, however, and certainly contemporary proponents of linguistic relativity do not adopt that position. As Casasanto (2008:65) notes, it is possible “that language can shape the way people think even if they do not think in language.”
In many cases criticisms of the relativistic position have also pointed to Whorf’s data and noted that his claims about other languages were inaccurate in various ways (e.g. Malotki [1983]). As noted above, these criticisms are fair as they relate to some of Whorf’s work in particular, but they are not necessarily germane to discussions of much of the current research on relativity. One impetus for the current volume is that many skeptics of relativity still seem to operate under the assumption that Whorf’s work represents the current state of the discussion on these issues.
In a similar vein, it seems that some of the ideological objections described above may be appealed to far too strictly. Much as strong deterministic claims equating language with thought are easily discarded, though, one can dispense with perspectives that completely ignore the potential for any sort of linguistic influences on thought. Such perspectives trivialize the profound variation in the semantic systems evident across languages by relying on universal approaches to meaning. Less radically, approaches such as Wierzbicka (1992) have suggested that the semantic concepts evident in crosslinguistic lexical variation can nevertheless be decomposed into atomistic units that are in fact universal, a conclusion that does leave open the possibility of some relativistic effects. Even such a decompositional universalist approach is considered by some untenable, however, since it may be difficult to reconcile with psycholinguistic data indicating that lexical concepts are activated holistically, not according to some series of semantic primes (see discussion in Levinson [2003]).
The notion that crosslinguistic semantic variation is somehow superficial and does not generate at least some variation in conceptualization is trouble-

30

Contextualizing the issues

some. Maintaining such a position on rigidly nativistic or modular theoretical grounds arguably does little to advance substantive debate on this important issue. An alternate position seems much more reasonable: As Vygotsky (1962[1938]) noted, “Thought is not merely expressed in words; it comes into existence through them.” Or we might say that some thought seems to come into being through words. Words may relate to more basic concepts, but they are not simply mapped on to antecedent concepts, at least not in all cases. Instead they are tools that at least facilitate thinking about concepts. For example, terms such as “mortgage-backed securities” or “derivative-oriented hedge funds” help us think about financial instruments in new ways, just like rolinho and caneta might help some people think of soccer in new ways. The expansion of scientific knowledge correlates with lexical expansion, as people need to exchange concepts and combine concepts in novel ways. This is all commonsensical, but the point is that lexical variation must play some role in conceptual variation. Which is not to say that speakers of different languages cannot adapt to such variation. Again, this alternative position is not a deterministic one. It simply admits at least some role of lexico-semantic variation in conceptual representation, and this admission constitutes an admission of at least a weak form of linguistic relativity, given the evidence for lexico-semantic variation across languages. Much as we cannot simply equate thought with language, then, we must admit that we could not think in all the ways we do without language. Furthermore, if language is instrumental to certain kinds of thought, then it is far from unreasonable to consider the possibility that linguistic disparities impact nonlinguistic thought.
Another difficulty with some strong objections to the relativistic position is that they occasionally restrict their attention to a particular aspect of cognition. This is particularly true with respect to discussions of color perception. While initial work on the subject (Brown and Lenneberg [1954], Lantz and Stefflre [1964]) offered support for a relativistic position, subsequent work, most notably Rosch (1972) and Berlin and Kay (1969), seemed incompatible with a relativistic position. In fact such studies served as the death knell for the linguistic relativity hypothesis in some quarters. Setting aside for the moment the fact that numerous subsequent studies have now demonstrated linguistic effects on the perception of color (see Chapter 7), one wonders how the absence of evidence for linguistic relativity in one domain could be taken as evidence for its absence in all domains. To truly appreciate the possibility of linguistic influences on nonlinguistic cognition, we need to consider carefully acquired data for a number of cognitive domains. If we restrict our attention to one domain only while formulating general hypotheses on the matter, those hypotheses will likely be short-lived. Hopefully the evidence presented in this

Issues with some prominent criticisms

31

volume will allow those concerned with this issue, perhaps even some skeptics, the chance to consider pertinent evidence in a more holistic manner. If, after having considered such evidence, such skeptics are not persuaded, at least their decision will not be based on data associated with only one cognitive domain.
As noted in Section 1.4, one of the issues facing research on relativity is the challenge of extricating linguistic influences from nonlinguistic cultural influences on cognition. In conducting such work, it may be misleading to demonstrate that cognition varies across two tested populations, and then offer a strictly linguistic interpretation of such variation. After all, other nonlinguistic cultural variables may be at play in such variation. In short, the anti-relativists often accurately claim, sometimes implicitly, that correlation does not imply linguistic causation. Nevertheless, it is worth noting in this discussion of issues with some anti-relativist positions (more specifically, those that are recalcitrant vis-à-vis the existence of any linguistic influences on thought), that extensive correlation of the sort in question also cannot be ignored. We cannot discard inductive reasoning in our attempts to better understand these issues, after all. If numerous correlations are established between particular linguistic features and particular behaviors, for example directional term types and spatial orientation strategies (see Chapter 4), the consistency of such correlations may crucially inform hypotheses on the subject. Correlation may not establish causation definitively, but it often points to the most reasonable explanation of a series of observations, as evidenced for example by the mere “correlation” between cigarettes and lung disease.
Finally, it is worth addressing one other major complication confronting strong anti-relativistic positions. Some anti-relativists maintain that language may influence thought, but only by providing us with referable concepts (Devitt and Strerelny 1987:178), or only when we are thinking in relationship to language, i.e. they admit only some on-line processing effects such as the “thinking for speaking” effects discussed in Slobin’s (1996) work. Yet an implicit assumption in this perspective is that the role of thinking for the specific purposes of language production and comprehension is somehow comparatively minor when contrasted to other forms of thought. This position is difficult to maintain completely, however, given how much language plays a role in our conscious experience. Consider for instance the results in Mehl et al. (2007) on the number of words American and Mexican college students produce per day. In that study, based on hundreds of participants, it was found that students produce approximately 15,000 words per day (irrespective of gender, contra popular assumptions). Now consider that most of these students must listen to and comprehend at least that many words, produced by their

32

Contextualizing the issues

peers and others, on a daily basis. Consider as well what a large percentage of the students’ lives is spent reading, writing, texting, or emailing, etc. The point is clear: Humans use language incessantly, for some large (though variable and admittedly undetermined) portion of their waking hours. So even if linguistic effects on cognition are restricted to the realm of language, a point that is vociferously disputed by proponents of linguistic relativity, it is worth stressing what a large realm that is! The activities of speaking, hearing, and otherwise engaging our language faculties comprise a sizeable chunk of our experience.
This, it would seem, is one of the problems with strong anti-relativistic positions: any admission of linguistic effects on cognition, even those associated with the processing of language only, forces one to consider just how pervasive such supposedly trivial effects may be. In addition, an actual consideration of just how experientially ubiquitous language is calls into question the notion that the systematic variations across “linguistic thought” does not bleed over into other aspects of thought. As Reines and Prinz (2009:1028) note, “linguistic behavior is so frequently rehearsed that it is likely to promote habits of thought that extend beyond language use.” For instance, given the overwhelming frequency of pronouns, does it not seem at least possible that thinking “with” markedly divergent pronominal systems during speech would result in at least some disparate patterns of nonlinguistic thought related to the semantic categories that are relevant to pronouns? (See Chapter 9 for some tentative evidence for such a disparity.)
In sum, much as there are issues with simplistic positions of linguistic determinism, there are also issues with the strongest anti-relativistic positions. Not all of the relevant issues have been surveyed here, either. (See Levinson [2003], Lucy [2004], Boroditsky [2011], inter alia, for further discussion.) This is not to suggest that there are no reasonable objections to some claims regarding linguistic relativity. It is to suggest instead that the linguistic relativity hypothesis is also not susceptible to simple off-hand rejections. In fact, there is much about the hypothesis that strikes many language researchers as appealing and intuitive. As Levinson et al. (2002) note in addressing Li and Gleitman’s (2001) critique of some work on relativity, “Resistance to this humble truth – linguistically-motivated categories pervade, change, and facilitate our thought – is puzzling.”

1.6 Types of linguistic relativity
To this point, we have discussed the linguistic relativity hypothesis in the broadest manner, as the basic belief that differences across languages generate

Types of linguistic relativity

33

effects on nonlinguistic cognition. Prima facie, such a characterization may seem sufficient. Yet while it is a useful starting point, it is a bit too generic. It says nothing, for instance, about the potential strength or pervasiveness of the putative effects. Such a broad interpretation of the relativity hypothesis allows us to consider influences on nonlinguistic cognition that differ markedly from the strong sorts of deterministic influences unfortunately associated with the hypothesis (see Gordon [2010] for discussion). Aside from the magnitude of the supposed relativistic effects, our working definition is vague in another respect: It does not divide relativity into any categories of effect types. As various authors have noted (e.g. Lucy [1996], Reines and Prinz [2009], Wolff and Holmes [2011]), relativistic effects can be categorized according to the general manner in which they influence cognition.
Consider for example Lucy’s (1996, 1997, 2004) basic categorization of “types” of relativity into three categories: “semiotic”, “structural”, and “discursive”. The first sort of relativity relates to the question of whether language “fundamentally alters the vision of the world held by humans in contrast to other species” (1996:39). Semiotic relativity is a closer affine to the philosophical treatments of the subject which date back centuries, focused on the basic question of whether language and human thought are dissociable. Understanding semiotic relativity is an important goal, but one that does not necessarily require the clearer understanding of cognitive differences across human populations. The latter two sorts of relativity, structural and discursive, are related to such differences. Discursive relativity refers to the notion that variations in patterns in the usage of language may influence the thought patterns of particular speakers. Even within particular linguistic communities, usage varies across speakers for functionally oriented reasons (Hymes [1974], Gumperz [1982]), such as vocation, status, gender, etc. Such variation in usage may foster relativistic effects among speakers of the same language. While discursive relativity is a fascinating topic, it too is not the focus of this book. We are concerned with what Lucy terms structural relativity, which is taken here to be linguistic relativity proper. Structural relativity refers to the notion that “characteristics of specific languages have an impact on the thought or behavior of those who speak them” (Lucy 1996:41). Unlike the other two sorts of relativity, structural/linguistic relativity is inherently crosslinguistically focused. In investigating such structural relativity, researchers are generally concerned with the ways in which systematic disparities across languages influence nonlinguistic cognition. In this book we will assume, like most contemporary researchers of the topic, that the study of linguistic relativity is concerned with variations of nonlinguistic cognition, rather than mental processes directly associated with speech or speech acts, and rather than with

34

Contextualizing the issues

other aspects of nonlinguistic behavior that are obviously tied to speech events or acts. More widely encompassing definitions of linguistic relativity are possible, however.6
The systematic linguistic disparities motivating relativistic effects may be grammatical or lexical.7 Other relativistic topics associated with, for instance, variations in linguistic praxis within a given socio-cultural milieu, are interesting issues that are related to the topic of this book. But that topic is more narrowly defined so as to highlight a particular strand of research, that on linguistic relativity proper. Of course that strand is part of a larger fabric of work on language, culture, and thought, work that includes treatments of topics such as semiotic and discursive relativity.
Assuming one equates linguistic relativity with structural relativity, as we have done, the concept can still be further sub-divided. There are different approaches to this sub-categorization in the literature. Since there is significant overlap between certain characteristics of different kinds of relativistic effects, such categorization efforts imply a neatness of divisions between effect types that may not be entirely accurate. Nevertheless, they can serve as a usual heuristic, as we attempt to make sense of the potential ways in which linguistic relativity manifests itself. In Chapter 11 we present one such heuristic categorization, after surveying the various kinds of relativistic effects now evident in the literature.
In this book we maintain the traditional division between language and thought. It is worth noting, though, that this traditional dichotomy is a bit misleading. As Boroditsky (2011:65) notes: “What researchers have been calling ‘thinking’ this whole time actually appears to be a collection of both linguistic and nonlinguistic processes. As a result, there may not be a lot of adult human

6 Sidnell and Enfield (2012) suggest another alternative definition, according to which linguistic relativity refers to how the language one speaks may have “consequences for thought, and for social life more generally” (2012:302). They suggest three potential loci of relativistic effects. One of these is the topic of this book, the way in which language impacts nonlinguistic cognition. The other relates to the way in which linguistic disparities impact the indexical relationships of a speech act (see Silverstein [1979]). A third loci, according to Sidnell and Enfield, relates to the way in which social actions are given different local “spins” in accordance with the lexicogrammatical resources of a given language. Note that only the first of these loci actually pertains to the way in which language impacts thought outside of the context of speaking. For other research on such broadly defined relativity, involving facets of cognition more directly tied to discourse, see Niemeier and Dirven (2000). 7 Part of the reason we would not want to exclude systematic lexical differences is that, as much work on construction grammar (Goldberg [1995]) has demonstrated, the bifurcation of language into lexical and grammatical components is, from the perspective of many linguists at least, in some sense artificial.

thinking where language does not play a role.” Rather than considering the ways in which language effects thought, we could frame our entire discussion in this book along different lines, for example: How much of thought is linguistic? How closely intertwined are linguistic thought and other thought types? Are linguistic facets of thought extricable from the greater web of thought? The standard convenient division between language and thought is utilized in this book, in large measure since this utilization facilitates interaction with the literature. Nevertheless, to some researchers at least, language represents one of many types of thought, and when we explore linguistic relativity we are essentially exploring the extent to which this type of thought interacts with others. Even if one chooses to frame the issue in this manner, however, the sorts of interactions between linguistic thought and other forms of thought cannot be stipulated a priori – we first need to look at the evidence across cognitive domains and languages.

1.7 The structure of this book
In this book some of the most crucial findings on linguistic relativity, uncovered primarily during the last two decades, are surveyed. The purpose of the survey is to represent the range and the depth of contemporary research on relativity in an easily digestible manner. To that end, we will consider the cognitive domains that have received the greatest amount of scrutiny. While the survey aims for comprehensiveness, it does not seek to be exhaustive. After all, much work on the subject is currently under way in this rapidly expanding field. Yet the remaining chapters of this book should at least familiarize you with the bulk of the significant recent research on this topic, while allowing you to come to your own conclusions regarding the evidence for different kinds of linguistic relativity.
It is worth stressing what this book is not. It is not a consideration of the cognitive mechanisms that allow for linguistic relativity, though some discussion of these mechanisms is offered in Chapter 11. It also does not address the social or political implications of linguistic relativity, or even whether such implications exist.
To more clearly depict where this survey will take us, it is worth encapsulating each of the following ten chapters. Chapter 2 serves as further background and considers the range of linguistic diversity that exists in the world. The discussion of such diversity is vital since relativistic effects crucially hinge on crosslinguistic diversity, and since many non-linguists are not familiar with the range of linguistic diversity actually in existence. We note in Chapter 2 that

36

Contextualizing the issues

few (if any) meaningful linguistic universals have actually been found despite decades worth of field research. We point out that the 7,000 or so extant languages reflect a remarkable diversity of human experience and cultures developed during the course of their histories in diverse ecologies. We also discuss the existence of general cognitive diversity across human populations. In Chapter 3 we discuss how a causal link between linguistic and cognitive diversity might be established methodologically. We offer an overview of basic methods employed in contemporary research on linguistic relativity. In Chapter 4 the crosslinguistic, cross-domain evaluations of the linguistic relativity literature begin in earnest. The chapter consists of a survey of findings related to the construal of spatial relationships. We examine research on the effects of disparate spatial language features on speakers’ spatial orientation strategies. We also consider work on the effects of various spatial adposition types on the perception of spatial relationships between objects. We devote the majority of our attention to providing overviews of several prominent studies, while also referencing numerous associated ones. This strategy of dwelling on some of the most noteworthy findings while indexing related ones is adhered to in subsequent chapters as well. Chapter 5 consists of an overview of research on crosslinguistic differences in temporal metaphors and their apparent influence on speakers’ perception of time. In Chapter 6 we consider a seemingly extreme sort of linguistic relativity that has surfaced in studies on numerical cognition. We devote a significant portion of that chapter to work among anumeric populations, work that indicates a clear ligature between cross-group differences in numerical language and numerical thought. In Chapter 7 we discuss several studies on the discrimination of color. This domain is arguably the most studied in research related to the linguistic relativity hypothesis. Much of this work has been used to support the linguistic relativity hypothesis, and much has been used to support anti-relativistic positions. We consider the most recent evidence for linguistic effects on color discrimination. In Chapter 8 we survey findings gathered among speakers of languages with nominal classifier systems, findings that suggest speakers perceptually discriminate some objects in accordance with such systems, unlike speakers of languages without classifier systems. Similarly, we consider evidence that crosslinguistic differences in count-mass distinctions lead to real-world effects on the individuation of objects and substances. Chapter 9 consists of an overview of a number of studies on the demonstrable cognitive effects of systems of grammatical gender on the perception of inanimate objects and other non-gendered stimuli. In Chapter 10 we tackle several miscellaneous cognitive domains for which there is now a growing body of studies related to linguistic relativity, but which have received less attention than those focused on in Chapters 4–9. These domains

The structure of this book

37

relate to phenomena such as event discrimination, counterfactual reasoning, and the perception of agency. In the eleventh and final chapter, we draw some broad conclusions, based on the evidence surveyed in the other chapters. The most basic conclusion we will draw goes something like this: There is now strong evidence for some form of the linguistic relativity hypothesis, across a variety of cognitive domains and languages. The evidence for relativistic effects in some domains is particularly strong, in others less so. We offer suggestions as to why this might be the case. We also underscore that, while our understanding of linguistic relativity has been greatly refined by the research described in this book, more work is required in order to better establish the extent of the influence of particular features of languages on the thought processes of their speakers.

2.1 Introduction
The existence of linguistic relativity is clearly contingent on diversity. That is, if we are to accept that linguistic diversity helps to foster cognitive diversity of any sort or to any degree, we must first agree that there is evidence for both cognitive diversity and linguistic diversity across human populations. Furthermore, for the concept of linguistic relativity to merit exploration, we might expect these diversities to be non-trivial. The purpose of this chapter is to establish that cross-cultural cognitive and linguistic diversities are real and demonstrable, though they have arguably received insufficient attention in the cognitive sciences and linguistics more specifically. The bulk of this chapter will be occupied with exploring linguistic diversity, since a) there is a presumption among some that linguistic diversity is limited, and b) cross-cultural cognitive diversity receives greater attention during the remainder of the volume.
2.2 Cognitive diversity across human populations
Our understanding of the variance of cognitive psychology across human populations is in many ways inchoate. Yet the growing evidence being gathered on this topic suggests that, in ways that sometimes defy expectations, humans think in very different ways. Perusal of the Journal of Cross-Cultural Psychology, for instance, hints at both similarities and dissimilarities in certain facets of human cognition, and this despite the fact that much of the work in this venue focuses on western and/or industrialized societies. The extent of cognitive dissimilarities is unclear since careful inquiry into cognitive variance across human populations remains in its incipient stages. While numerous studies on cognitive variation across radically disparate cultures have been produced in recent years, their numbers pale in comparison to those of studies based on a much narrower range of the spectrum of culture types. Only now are we beginning to appreciate how the absence of a truly cross-cultural focus in the relevant work has potentially generated incorrect assumptions of uniformity of human cognition. This is not to suggest that uniformity of any sort does not exist, as we stressed in the preceding chapter. After all, humans share the same biology. This shared biology includes, however, massive cortical plasticity and other features that allow for adaptation to an assortment of ecologies. Furthermore a wealth of evidence points to cultural and biological co-evolution (Boyd

and Richerson [2005], Boyd, Richerson, and Henrich [2011]) among humans, and the overwhelmingly shared DNA among human populations does not preclude variation in supposedly fundamental facets of human cognition, some of which may result ontogenetically from what are in fact culturally dependent factors. Establishing the universality of certain cognitive processes and associated behaviors, even some seemingly basic ones, remains in many cases an open-ended task necessitating cross-cultural and crosslinguistic approaches, only some of which are represented in this book.
As obvious as it may seem to some, it is important to reiterate that what is at issue here is the role of cultural factors, specifically language, rather than genetic ones. The comparatively limited role of allele variation in cognitive diversity is evidenced when pre-linguistic infants are transplanted from one culture to another. In such cases of cross-cultural adoption the children subsequently exhibit normal cognitive and social development. To cite one relatively uncommon sort of example, a friend of mine was born into a Tupían family in Brazil. Her native culture and language differ markedly from those of western industrialized societies in a number of respects. For a variety of reasons, including the death of her biological parents during her infancy, she was adopted by missionaries. Eventually she gained American citizenship, and presently resides with her American husband and children in the South. Her unsurprisingly typical cognitive development is evidenced by, among other things, a successful academic career including a college degree. Furthermore she is deeply ensconced in her current “southern” culture. While I am unaware of any other American Amazonian indigenes, her case is illustrative of a wider pattern, since humans native to one culture are frequently raised in another while exhibiting linguistic and cognitive development considered normal in their new culture.
Cross-population genotypic heterogeneity may play a relatively limited role in cognitive development, but nevertheless there is strong evidence for crosspopulation differences in cognition that result from socio-cultural, including linguistic, disparities across human groups. Since language-based motivations are the topic of this book, it is worth demonstrating that a number of nonlinguistically motivated variations in human cognition across human populations have already been detailed in the literature.
Consider the two horizontal lines (parallel to the text) in Figure 2.1. Which is longer, the one on the left or the right? If you are like most people that have been exposed to this pair of lines, you will select the one on the right though the lines are actually equal in length. The perception of these lines results in a well-known illusion, the Müller-Lyer (1889) illusion. This illusion was once presumed to result from some basic feature of human visual perception. Given

that it is a very low-level processing effect, certain accounts would seem to predict its universality, since according to them (e.g. Fodor [1975]), low-level basic cognitive processes are not predicted to vary across people groups. It turns out, however, that there is in fact extensive variation in the perception of paired lines such as those in Figure 2.1, in accordance with the culture of the perceivers. A team of cognitive scientists investigated this and other perceptual illusions across sixteen societies, representing a variety of cultural categories (Segall, Campbell, and Herskovits [1966]). Astonishingly to some, they discovered that this optical illusion varies to the point of non-existence in some cultures. For example, San foragers are not susceptible to this illusion and do not typically perceive the line on the left to be shorter than that on the right. Tellingly, of the sixteen societies tested, the pool of American participants demonstrated an extreme degree of susceptibility to the illusion. The next mostsusceptible group was the European contingent of participants. The remaining societal groups varied in their susceptibility. To better understand the variance in the perception of these lines, Segall, Campbell, and Herskovits (1966) increased the length of the line on the left incrementally, in order to test at which length that line was perceived to be the same length as the line on the right. They referred to this modified length as the “point of subjective equality” or PSE. For over half the populations of the adults tested, the line on the left was only required to exceed the other line in length by six percent or less for the PSE to be reached. For two tested groups, PSE was reached with a one percent difference. The American undergrads tested comprised an outlier group, and the PSE was only attained for this group when actual length discrepancy neared twenty percent. In short, this illusion that was thought to instantiate a basic low-level perceptual characteristic of the human species turned out to be far from universal. Analogously variable results were obtained for some (though not all) of the illusions tested for in Segall, Campbell, and Herskovits (1966), including the Sander-Parallelogram and Horizontal-Vertical illusions.
It is unclear exactly what sort of cultural and ecological factors motivate the heighted susceptibility of Americans to this illusion, though Segall, Campbell, and Herskovits (1966) note that the repeated exposure to phenomena such as “carpeted corners” and other environmentally-contingent factors associated with American culture may play significant roles. As Henrich, Heine, and Nor-

enzayan (2010) suggest, these results imply that the “visual system ontogenetically adapts to the presence or recurrent features in the local visual environment.”
Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan (2010) discuss these results on visual perception in suggesting that the focus on Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic (WEIRD) people in research on human psychology has led to an assortment of similarly erroneous assumptions regarding putatively universal cognitive processes. Much as linguistics has had a historical tendency to focus on “average European” languages, a tendency that Boas, Sapir, Whorf and other anthropological linguists labor(ed) against, psychology has had an unfortunate tendency to focus on subjects from WEIRD societies, according to Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan (2010).8 This conclusion is supported by Arnett’s (2008) meta-analysis of major psychology journals, which suggested that between 2003 and 2007, 99% of the authors in the relevant journals were from Western industrialized nations, and that 96% of their samples came from such societies. This sample skewing results from practical considerations in most cases, and in many instances a more cross-cultural sample would not benefit the studies’ aims. Nevertheless, the skewing is troublesome to the extent that some psychological processes are assumed to be universal when the studies that have uncovered them are based on a narrow and frequently non-representative cross-section of culture types. While no doubt many features of cognition are universal, many researchers believe such universality can only be established once those features have been uncovered in a widerange of human cultures, including hunter-gatherer groups that are likely to more closely resemble in crucial respects the cultures shared by humans during the majority of the time in which our currently-shared neurophysiological apparatuses evolved.
Where cross-cultural sampling has been taken seriously in investigations into basic cognitive processes, some results have in fact suggested universal patterns. This is true, for instance, in work on the universality of certain basic emotions such as fear and joy (Ekman [1999]), the apparently universal belief in the autonomy of human mental and biological functions (Cohen et al. [2011]), or in the seeming universality of psychological essentialism discussed in Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan (2010:69). (See also Gelman [2003], Astuti, Solomon, and Carey [2004])9 In other cases, however, careful cross-cultural

8 In fact, research subjects typically represent a narrower segment of WEIRD societies, namely undergraduates. Results based on undergraduates often do not generalize to the other populations (Atran and Medin [2008], Medin and Atran [2004]). 9 Though see Prinz (2012) for an extensive critical discussion of much of the extant work on putative universals of human behavior, as well as a critical assessment of many of the universal features of human cognition positied by prominent evolutionary psychologists.

sampling has revealed variation where it might not have been expected. This is true in the case of some visual perception phenomena such as the MüllerLyer illusion, but also in cross-cultural variations in folk-biological reasoning, self-evaluation processes, evaluation of others’ behavior, and heritability of IQ.
Consider the case of folkbiological reasoning. Widely circulated work (Carey [1985]) has concluded that there is a crucial developmental stage, occurring between the ages of seven and ten, during which the perspective of humans vis-à-vis other biological entities is altered. Prior to this stage, children tend to anthropomorphize other biological phenomena, perceiving their characteristics in quasi-humanistic terms. Following this stage, the perception is generally reversed, to the extent that humans then perceive themselves as one of many kinds of biological entities in existence. While this transmogrification is interesting, it is unclear in fact how generalizable it is to the species as a whole. It turns out that the findings on which this conclusion is based have not been replicated in studies among smaller-scale societies indigenous to the Americas (Atran et al. [2001], Ross et al. [2003]). In fact, the transition appears to occur much earlier in non-urban societies in which humans interact more habitually and directly with a greater variety of flora and fauna. In some sense, the children in these less urban and industrialized societies exhibit less anthropocentrism in their reasoning concerning biological categories. Variant degrees of anthropocentric reasoning represent another non-trivial sort of cognitive difference. Yet this sort of variance can easily be missed or glossed over if assumptions of cognitive uniformity are made from the results obtained among one type of population. Such assumptions are particularly troubling since the populations they are based on, viz. western industrialized ones, are aberrant with respect to their members’ familiarity with non-developed ecologies, and since non-industrialized cultures more closely resemble the cultures of humans residing in Africa prior to the scattering of the species into radically disparate environments. This presumed (relative) semblance between nonindustrialized cultures, particularly hunter-gatherer tribes, and the original African cultures is due to shared features such as the absence of technologies like agriculture and writing, which have had profound effects on those cultures in which they have been adopted.
Another commonly held assumption of universality that is actually contravened by cross-cultural data relates to the notion of self-evaluation. It is commonly assumed that humans have a tendency to view themselves, on an individual level, in a positive light. The idea that “everyone is above average” is not merely shared by the fictitious citizens of Lake Wobegon. The tendency for people to have a comparatively positive assessment of self certainly surfaces in some western societies. People in such societies are often biased to perceived

43

themselves and their behaviors in a more positive light than an objective assessment might warrant. This sort of perceptual narcissism is remarkably intuitive to many, perhaps since the positive valuation of self is inculcated in them from an early age. Certainly positive self-evaluation corresponds with the cultural values espoused in many media in contemporary American culture, for example. Yet, as you might have guessed given the course of the current discussion, it turns out that this tendency towards positive views of the individual self are far from universal. Studies among Native Americans (Fryberg and Markus [2003]), Fijians (Rennie and Dunne [1994]), and East Asians (Heine and Hamamura [2007]), inter alia, have demonstrated that there is extensive cross-cultural variation in the extent to which individuals are inclined to generally perceive themselves in a better-than-average sort of manner. One might even argue that some of these cultures exhibit a greater tendency towards self-objectivity. Regardless, what is clear is that such self-enhancing thought patterns are not universal, at least not in the manner sometimes assumed.
Just as there are cross-societal dissimilarities in aspects of how the self is perceived, there are dissimilarities in the manner in which others are perceived. Studies among Westerners have revealed an essentialist tendency according to which people perceive comportment to represent the nature or inherent disposition of a given person exhibiting the behavior in question (Jones and Harris [1967], Ross, Amabile, and Steinmetz[1977]). The behavior is assumed to represent some unwavering quality of the person in question, with less attention paid to mitigating situational factors. This pattern of attribution, though, turns out not to surface in studies of members of some societies. Studies among East Asians (Miyamoto and Kitayama [2002], Akiko et al. [1999]) and Russians (Grossmann and Varnum [2010]) suggest that members of these groups are more likely than Americans to attribute behavior to contextual constraints rather than to the essential disposition of the actors. In investigating the perception of personality across eight populations, Church et al. (2006) found that members of Western societies were more likely to judge personality traits to be stable concepts, less malleable by experiential factors, when contrasted to members of non-Western groups. The latter subjects were more likely to consider such traits poor descriptors of people, and more likely to perceive them as contingent on external factors. The variability in the perception of personality attribution strikes some Westerners as counter-intuitive. It is precisely because the results of systematic cross-cultural data collection are sometimes counter-intuitive, however, that such collection is crucial to the formulation of ideas on universal thought processes. After all, such ideas are typically promulgated by Westerners whose intuitions are, not shockingly, more likely to be matched by data gathered among other Westerners.

As a final example of cross-population variation in cognition, consider the example of IQ heritability. There is a strong assumption among some that measures of IQ are primarily determined by genetic factors rather than those associated with family environment. Even within American society, however, socio-economic status appears to play a significant role in the extent to which IQ is heritable. Turkheimer et al. (2003) present data on twins representing divergent socioeconomic statuses, and these data suggest convincingly that genetic factors play a much more prominent role in IQ variation among members of higher socioeconomic status, whereas factors associated with family environment play a comparatively greater role in those of lower status. The influence of socioeconomic status on heritability of IQ suggests that even cognitive processes with clear genetic influences remain susceptible to contextual influences and, more specifically, that IQ is affected by environmental factors within a western culture. The latter point is perhaps unsurprising but nevertheless worth stressing. If something like IQ, which is associated with an assortment of cognitive processes, can be affected by contextual factors within a given culture, it seems fair to assume that the cognitive processes in question would vary in accordance with the even-wider range of contextual factors evident in multiple cultures. After all, the differences between the childhoods of Americans from lower and higher socioeconomic statuses, respectively, pale in comparison to those between childhoods in western industrialized societies and, for example, indigenous tribal societies. (Rogoff, Morelli, and Angelillo [2003])
The aforementioned instances of cognitive variation, along with others surveyed in Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan (2010) and elsewhere, have surfaced through the examination of data from a number of cultures, and have resulted from the recent surge in interest among cognitive scientists on the roles of culture and language in shaping cognition. As Bender, Hutchins, and Medin (2010) suggest, anthropologically oriented considerations of cultural influence on cognition are crucial for the future health of cognitive science and, more specifically, cognitive psychology. Such health is contingent on the recognition and exploration of cases of variation such as those mentioned here. Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan (2010:78) make the following insightful claim regarding the potential motivations for such variation: “The causal origins of such population-level variation may be manifold, including behavioral plasticity in response to different environments, epigenetic effects, divergent trajectories of cultural evolution, and even the differential distribution of genes across groups in response to divergent evolutionary histories.” To this manifold list of causal origins, we might add crosslinguistic variation, a causal feature that is potentially subsumed by “different trajectories of cultural evolution”, yet merits

explicit stipulation. In the next section we briefly survey the range of such crosslinguistic variation, in order to get an idea of how profound it is and how it too might help foster cognitive variation within our species.

2.3 Linguistic diversity across human populations
There are approximately 7,000 extant languages detailed in the most comprehensive listing of the world’s languages, the Ethnologue (Lewis [2009]). This figure represents, somewhat closely anyhow, the number of mutually unintelligible languages in contemporary usage. Degree of intelligibility is a tricky notion though, and the decision to consider two speech varieties separate languages or separate dialects is not always easy, and is often informed by political rather than linguistic criteria. The decision to consider Mandarin and Cantonese ‘Chinese’ is largely political, as is the decision to consider Serbian and Croatian separate languages. In fact the former pair of languages are more dissimilar from each other on purely linguistic terms than the latter pair are from each other. In these cases linguistic criteria may suggest an alternate classification, but in some cases even linguistic criteria related to degree of mutual intelligibility are insufficient to arrive at such decisions since the division between “separate dialects” status and “separate languages” status is cline-like.
Regardless of the exact number of extant languages, what is clear is that there is a remarkable diversity in the linguistic practices of human beings. Some languages are manual, with dozens of signed languages in existence, and some of these, like American Signed Language, are spoken over enormous geographic areas. Not all languages involving manual signs are in the visual modality, either, as evidenced by the tactile signing of the deaf-blind. Most languages are conveyed via the vocal-auditory channel, but even these spoken forms can be represented in other modalities–via writing, Morse code, semaphores, etc. Given the limitations of human sensory and motor capacity, the diversity of forms that human language can take is remarkable.
Yet when we focus on speech only, the extent of linguistic diversity is no less impressive. About 100 spoken languages are isolates, with no known related languages. The remaining languages can be divided into 300 or so “stocks” or families of various sizes (Nichols [1992]), based on historical relatedness. Some areas of the world are particularly diverse in terms of the number of language families: There are approximately 50 language stocks in Amazonia alone (Everett [2010]), and even more in New Guinea. Since modern linguistics has been dominated primarily by native speakers of languages utilized in rich

46

Acknowledging diversity

industrialized nations, in particular Indo-European languages, the vast majority of the linguistic enterprise has been focused on a very narrow band of the spectrum of linguistic diversity (i.e. one “stock”).
Some things about speech are universal, at least to the extent that human groups share the same biological features that have been exapted for speech. These include vocal-auditory tracts with a lowered larynx that, paradoxically, facilitates both speech and choking. (Lieberman [2007]) The approximately 1:1 ratio of the lengths of the oral and pharyngeal portions of the supralaryngeal tract, which has resulted from the lowering of the larynx, is crucial to the production of disparate vowel types. Another universal biological feature that is crucial to speech is the cochlea in our inner ears, which is particularly sensitive to frequencies below 5,000 kHz, where most speech information is conveyed. The etiology of such universal features is a matter of some debate in current work on the evolution of language (Smith, Smith, and Cancho [2008]), yet computer-simulation-based studies suggest unequivocally that they predate the emergence of language itself (Christiansen, Chater, and Reali [2009]). Given the rapidity of linguistic and cultural change when contrasted to genomic change (see Atkinson et al. [2008]), it seems very plausible that such features were co-opted for linguistic purposes some time relatively recently, perhaps as little as 60,000 to 200,000 thousand years ago (see Kenneally [2007] for one survey of the relevant evidence). Language itself may well predate such co-opting, though, in non-spoken form.10 Despite the universal nature of certain biological features co-opted for language by humans, the extant language stocks show remarkable diversity. This diversity is most easily understood within an evolution-oriented framework, so it is worth making a few relevant comments regarding the evolution of the only linguistic species.
The truth is, our understanding of human evolution is in constant flux. While it is clear, for instance, that hominids were bipedal as far back as Australopithecus, the bipedal status of our common ancestor with chimpanzees has become a topic of debate since the discovery of Ardipithecus (White et al. [2009]). The origins and motivations of bipedalism remain a source of discussion, as do the origins of other biological characteristics of our species such as our high encephelization quotient (E.Q.), i.e. the existence of our large, very calorie-consuming, brains (Schoenemann [2004]). Some research suggests that

10 In fact, one influential current strain of research on the evolution of language suggests that our biology was only exploited for speech well after the origin of language in the visual modality of gestures and signs (Corballis [2003], Arbib [2005]), after humans had begun demonstrating the ability to share attention and intentions with each other in ways that other primates lack even today (Tomasello [2008]).

47

our high E.Q.’s, like our relatively small gastro-intestinal tracts, may have benefited from the advent of cooking among our hominid ancestors, potentially as far back as 1.6 to 1.9 million years ago (Wrangham [2009]). In other words, cooking may be an example par excellence of culture influencing evolution.
While some of the motivations for our shared human biology are debated, though, findings on the development of our species point clearly to an African origin. These findings include countless fossil findings by physical anthropologists, genetic evidence (e.g. Nei [1995]), and most recently (and much more controversially), linguistic evidence (Atkinson [2011], Jaeger et al. [2011]). The dispersion of our species from Africa occurred at least 50,000 years ago (Klein [2009] and probably much earlier). This point is crucial to our understanding of synchronic linguistic diversity, since relevant findings suggest that the first members of our species to exit the continent were already equipped with language and culture. This conclusion is supported by certain complex behaviors in human culture apparent around this time in the fossil record, for instance the complex glue-making processes evident at the Sibudu caves in South Africa, which would seem to have required language (Wadley, Hodgskiss, and Grant [2009]). In short, by the time we began our circum-ambulation of the world, we were equipped with the tools of culture and language; we were well adapted for adaptation.
This brief digression into the history of our species suggests then that the remarkable linguistic diversity that we see in the world today is primarily the result of processes that have occurred over dozens of millennia, during the transmission of language across social groups and across generations. In fact, linguists estimate that the current diversity on offer represents but a small segment of the diversity that has existed. Pagel (2000) posits the existence of over half a million human languages during the course of our species’ history, or more than seventy times the amount currently in existence. The first language (or less likely, the small set of first languages) has changed in innumerable ways over the millennia, through processes such as grammaticalization (Hopper and Traugott [2003]) and phonetic change (Labov [2001]) that are still at work today. Rapid expansion helped foster rapidly diversifying language, which changed, at least in part, to meet local ecologies and cultural contexts. The net result was extreme synchronic linguistic diversity, to the point that few, some argue no, linguistic universals can be found in the world’s languages today – which again only represent a fraction of the human languages that have been spoken since the African exodus.
As Evans and Levinson (2009) suggest in some detail, decades of research by linguistic fieldworkers and typologists have not yielded substantive linguistic universals of the sort many linguists in the mid-twentieth century expected

48

Acknowledging diversity

to uncover. Instead, such research has yielded a phenomenal breadth of diversity in the forms and practices associated with language. Much as Henrich, Heine, and Norenzayan (2010) suggest that assumptions of universality vis-àvis some human cognitive features are based unduly on findings among WEIRD populations, Evans and Levinson (2009) suggest that many expectations of linguistic universals were based in large measure on an over-reliance on European languages. This claim is familiar to many typologically oriented linguists, who have been making it in one form or another for some time. Put differently, an ever-growing number of linguists believe that assumptions of a “universal grammar” were inordinately influenced by the grammar of a small subset of the world’s languages. As our knowledge of many non-Indo-European language groups has developed, it has been increasingly difficult to reconcile the relevant data gathered by linguists in the field with beliefs of grammatical homogeneity at any meaningful level. This has led to increasingly abstract formulations of what is universal to human languages (Chomsky [1995]). Hauser, Chomsky, and Fitch (2002) suggest that syntactic recursion is an exceptionless linguistic universal, yet even this feature is apparently not common to all human languages (D. Everett [2005, 2009]).
Members of all cultures have the capacity to learn language. Given the genotypic homogeneity of our species, this is not surprising. We all share common cognitive and perceptual capacities that facilitate the acquisition of speech. Our genes grant us certain features that allow us to learn language, but also to walk, and parse colors, and sounds, and generate various other behaviors that are common to our species. We share certain basic goals and needs as a species. We also share “exposure to salient discontinuities among entities that the world presents to the observer” (Malt and Wolff [2010:9]), for instance between water and earth, earth and sky, and the like. Yet, despite all that we share as a species, we are also a remarkably diverse one. In fact, some researchers have suggested that the most distinguishing characteristic of our species is its behavioral diversity. In the words of Prinz (2012:xi), for instance, “Human beings are genetically more homogenous than chimps, but behaviorally more diverse than any other species.”
In the face of our genetic similarity, and the universal features of our environments, goals, and needs, it is perhaps not surprising that there are some basic commonalities shared by many languages. Also, relationships between languages and contact between unrelated languages have resulted in many other linguistic commonalities. In fact, given such motivations for linguistic similarity, the range of existing linguistic diversity is particularly noteworthy. After all, while there are certain statistical tendencies for “conditional” patterns in the world’s languages (Greenberg [1966], Dryer [2003]), there are no

Linguistic diversity across human populations

49

uncontested “unconditional” linguistic universals. Furthermore, conditional or implicational patterns in the world’s languages simply demonstrate that some linguistic features are more marked than others, and such markedness is often of a trivial sort. For instance, I could make the following true claim: “If a language has a word for the number seventeen, it must also have a word for the number one.” This implicational universal holds true, but it is obviously vacuous. As Evans and Levinson (2009:438) suggest, once less vacuous conditional universals are examined, many are confronted with exceptions despite the fact that the vast majority of the languages that have ever existed are undocumented.
In those cases where implicational patterns are universally valid, they can frequently be explained by the greater processing cost of the antecedent with respect to the consequent (Haspelmath [2009]). For instance, with respect to the implicational universal just cited, it is more difficult to conceptualize “seventeen” than “one”. More importantly, there are no substantive, non-implicational universals accepted by the all linguists. We cannot even claim, for instance, that all languages have vowels or consonants, since many languages are signed. We might claim that all spoken languages have vowels, but this illustrates another issue with some statements on universality: they are arguably tautological. If people use language in the vocal-auditory channel, then they must vibrate their vocal cords and open their mouths to be heard at most distances. So by necessity any language associated with this channel must have vowels – it would be pratically inaudible otherwise. Furthermore, some (though by no means all) implicational universals are based on such tautological expressions. Consider the following implicational, which is familiar to many linguists yet arguably meaningless:
“If a language has nasal vowels, then it has oral vowels.”
Given that the consequent of this implication (“then it has oral vowels”) is circularly exceptionless in spoken languages, any antecedent could be placed before it for the entire implicational to hold logically. For instance, these other candidate conditional universals are equally valid:
“If a language has forty-three adjectives, then it has oral vowels.”
“If a language is spoken by agriculturalists, then it has oral vowels.”
Ad infinitum. In short, the search for meaningful universal aspects of the grammars of
languages has been a largely frustrating one for linguists. Candidate universals

50

Acknowledging diversity

such as constituency, recursion, and word order patterns are inevitably met with exceptions of various kinds (Evans and Levinson [2009], Croft [2001]). The absence of clear universals is particularly remarkable in the light of the sample of languages used to corroborate their absence: a very small percentage of the languages that homo sapiens has employed during its history. Furthermore, those in existence today have clearly affected each other in pervasive and demonstrable ways, resulting in some cases in linguistic tendencies that occasionally give the impression of universality with respect to some feature.11
Much as it is difficult to establish universal features of language, it is difficult to establish whether certain parts of the brain are genetically wired for linguistic tasks. While particular cortical areas such as Broca’s and Wernicke’s have long been known to correlate with certain linguistic abilities, people without these areas are capable of learning language, assuming the areas in question are removed very early during life–even in the extreme cases of hemispherectomies. Given the plasticity of the human cortex, many of its regions can be adopted for language usage. Furthermore, the results from neuroimaging studies paint a murky picture with respect to the cortical loci of language (Fedorenko and Kanwisher [2009]), and researchers are only now beginning to appreciate the importance of non-cortical anatomy, such as the basal ganglia, in linguistic functioning. (Lieberman [2007]) In a related vein, just as it is difficult to pinpoint areas of the brain specifically associated with language, it is also difficult to pinpoint particular genes associated with this human behavior. One oft-cited candidate “language gene” is FOXP2. While adaptations in the FOXP2 gene may have played a role in the development of language, though, this gene itself is common to many nonlinguistic mammals and its precise role in language production is far from clear.
Clearly it is difficult if not impossible to establish universal features associated with language, either in human speech or in human biology. Obviously, there are many universal aptitudes and capacities that relate to language, and there are certain common tendencies evident in the grammars of spoken languages. Such tendencies do not preclude the possibility of extensive linguistic variation, though, and as we focus increasingly on non-European languages, the visible wealth of diversity is impressive. Next we attempt to illustrate the sort of linguistic diversity that actually exists in the world’s spoken languages. The illustrations given may be unfamiliar to non-linguists, some of whom have been led to believe that “the grammars and lexicons of all languages are

11 See for example the suggestions made by Dunn et al. (2011) vis-à-vis word order patterns. As the authors of that study note, lineage-specific tendencies point to socio-cultural and humaninteractive factors determining linguistic structure in very real stock-dependent ways.

51

broadly similar.” (Li and Gleitman [2002]) It is worth re-stressing that the ultimate goal of this entire discussion of linguistic diversity is to consider whether the typological data are consistent with the notion of linguistic relativity. After all, for the linguistic relativity hypothesis to even begin to hold water, there must be evidence for non-trivial variation in cognition and language across human populations.
Perhaps the most obvious way in which spoken languages diverge is through their sounds. At the coarsest level we can note that a language may have as few as eleven basic meaningful units of sound, for instance in the case of Pirahã and Rotokas. (Though these units may take different forms depending on their contexts, i.e. phonemes may exhibit extensive allophonic variation.) The phonemic inventories of these languages contrast markedly with a language such as !Xóõ, a Khoisan language with over one hundred phonemes.12 (Maddieson [1984]) Admittedly these cases are statistical outliers, but they serve to illustrate the point that languages vary tremendously in terms of size of their sets of basic sounds. In many cases as well, languages differ in the way these phonemes are distributed. Some dialects of English, for example, have over twenty vowel phonemes and over twenty consonantal phonemes. While the overall number of phonemes in English is not particularly remarkable, the relatively high number of vowel types is.
Not only does the number of sounds vary from language to language, but the types of sounds used also vary. This range of sound types relates to every part of the human vocal tract, beginning with the vocal cords. As is well known, in many languages the fundamental frequency at which a speaker’s vocal cords vibrate (pitch) can be used differentially to change meaning. In fact, over half the world’s languages exhibit such tonality (Ladefoged and Maddieson [1996]). Yet to speakers of many languages, tone distinctions are notoriously difficult to learn. Furthermore, many languages require other kinds of vocal cord modulation in order to create meaning contrasts. For instance, the arytenoid cartilages in the larynx can be drawn closely together in order to create particularly tense vocal cords. This laryngealization causes the cords to

12 As Port (2007) suggests, the concept of the phoneme itself may be too heavily based on the Western tradition of segmenting sounds into letter-size units. According to Port, our alphabetic tradition gives the impression that such sounds are basic to language, an impression that is actually difficult to support with acoustic or experimental data. Syllables may be more meaningful units of sound to speakers of unwritten languages, or those with non-alphabetic traditions. After all, the difference between many plosives and fricatives are inaudible in the absence of adjacent vowels with characteristically influenced fundamental frequency harmonics known as vowel “formants” (Sussman et al. [1999], Everett [2008]). In other words, consonant-vowel clusters are difficult to tease apart perceptually and articulatorily.

vibrate more slowly than in cases of normal voicing, and creates a distinctive creaky sound. Such laryngealization is used to create meaning contrasts in some languages, for instance Danish, but is completely absent in others. The vocal cords can be used in other ways as well, for instance in “breathy” sounds. For a discussion of the range of ways in which vocal cord movement is altered across languages, see Ladefoged and Maddieson (1996).
Another very basic manner in which the languages of the world exhibit phonetic/sound-based diversity is in the range of airstream mechanisms they utilize. To create sound in the vocal tract, air must pass through it. The most natural way for an airstream to be generated would seem to be via compression of the lungs, and in fact an egressive pulmonic airstream is utilized for most sound types. Yet languages utilize three other airstream types also. In the case of the clicks of many sub-Saharan languages, for instance, air runs into the mouth after occlusion is created at two points in the oral cavity. This double occlusion results in a small chamber of air, whose size is then increased to reduce air pressure. When the occlusion closest to the front of the mouth is released, air rushes in to fill the chamber of lowered pressure, creating the popping or clicking sound. In the case of “ejective” sounds, found in many languages of the Pacific Northwest and elsewhere, air is ejected out of the mouth after pressure on an analogous chamber of air is increased rather than decreased. This chamber is created by closing the glottis at the same time occlusion is made at some location in the supralaryngeal tract. The glottis is then raised, the occlusion is released, and air is ejected from the mouth. Finally, implosives (common to Southeast Asia and found in other regions) are generated in a similar manner to ejectives, except in the case of the former sound type the glottis is lowered prior to the opening of the air chamber. The net result is a rush of air into the mouth. Spoken languages utilize an impressive variety of airstream mechanisms in their production, especially considering the clear physical bias towards using an egressive pulmonic airstream.13
We are beginning to get some sense of the phonetic diversity that exists in human languages, and we have not even considered the most obvious and significant way in which human languages vary according to this dimension: the manner in which people use their supralaryngeal articulators to make sounds. These articulators include the tip, blade, and root of the tongue, as well as the lips, teeth, and soft palate. The articulators are brought into contact or near contact with various parts of the vocal tract, and manipulated in other

13 Only the pulmonic airstream causes air to rush past the vocal cords in such a way as to create reduced air pressure across the vocal cords (via Bernoulli’s effect), causing them to vibrate together in order to make the loud voiced sounds so crucial to language.

ways, in an as-yet-undefined number of ways. In other words, it is unclear how many sounds exist in the world’s languages. A glance at the chart of the International Phonetic Association may give the impression that there is a fixed set of sounds in the world’s languages, but this chart is merely a heuristic tool used to transcribe, sometimes approximately, languages’ consonants and vowels.
Suffice it to say that, given that humans share tongues, alveolar ridges, teeth, soft palates, and the like, we appear to exploit this biology to the extent that is biologically permissible in the creation of dissimilar sounds. There are some crosslinguistic tendencies in the creation of meaningful sounds. These tendencies typically have clear articulatory or perceptual motivations, as evidenced by the commonality of contrasts between easily distinguishable vowels made with the tongue positioned in the back or the front of the mouth, respectively, and the commonality of sounds made with the lips or tongue tip. Despite such motivations for commonality, however, humans exploit their vocal tracts in a remarkable variety of ways during the production of speech. This variety is so extreme that the careful inspection of any one particular language often turns up uncommon or unique phonetic characteristics.
For an example of this, let me return to Karitiâna, an Amazonian language I have spent a fair amount of time investigating. One of the interesting things about the language, which is readily noticeable if you are attempting to transcribe it, is that certain words can be pronounced in very different ways from one utterance to another, by the same speaker. Some words with nasal sounds, produced with a lowered velum (soft palate), can vary in seemingly random ways. In particular, bi-syllabic words with nasals in the onset of the second syllable exhibit this variation. The word for ‘thing’, for example, can be produced as kinda, kida, or kidnda. The word for ‘waist’ can be pronounced as senda, seda, or sednda. Analogous examples abound. In most languages, such variation is impermissible. If you frequently pronounced an English word such as ‘summer’ as ‘sumber’ or ‘submber’, listeners would be puzzled. So why is such variation permitted in Karitiâna? Systematic acoustic analysis of many such words, produced by a number of speakers, suggests that the duration with which the Karitiâna lower their velum in such words is largely random. Basically the language does not insist on neat nasal sounds of a given duration. (Everett [2011a]) Since there are no other clearly documented cases of this sort of nasal pattern, Karitiâna may be unique in this respect. Crucially though, it is very non-unique in its utilization of a unique sound pattern. The point is that, whenever linguists look very carefully at the sound systems of relatively little-documented indigenous languages, they often uncover sound patterns that were previously unknown. It so happens that I have spent time analyzing

54

the Karitiâna sound system. Had I spent time investigating some other indigenous language I might well be able to provide some unique feature of that language’s sounds. The frequency with which field linguists uncover such unusual phenomena hints at the extreme diversity of sound patterns in the world’s languages. In fact, many phoneticians are skeptical of the notion that there is some describable basic inventory of sounds in human languages. (Port and Leary [2005]) Many phonologists who have considered the wealth of data on sound diversity are equally skeptical that such a list could be generated (Pierrehumbert [2001], Bybee [2001]). In the most comprehensive survey of linguistic sounds to date, Ladefoged and Maddieson (1996:369) note that “the next generation of speakers… may even create sounds that have never been used in a human language before.” In short, while humans share the same vocal apparatus, they exploit it in such diverse ways that it is impossible to place an upper limit on the kinds of sounds we make.
In illustrating the extremity of extant diversity in spoken languages, it makes sense to start at the lowest level, variation in the meaningful sounds produced and heard by humans. Physically at least, spoken language consists of sound waves transferred from the vocal tract of speakers to the inner ears of listeners. If extreme variation in the form of these acoustic signals exists, this variation may point to extensive variation at higher-level stages of language production and comprehension. Nevertheless, in principle this soundpattern diversity could exist without concomitant variation at such higher levels. If linguistic variation plays a role in cognitive variation, though, there should also be evidence for significant crosslinguistic diversity in the semantic structures of lexicons, not to mention profound crosslinguistic diversity in morphological and syntactic patterns. In fact evidence for such diversity abounds. We will discuss several sorts of lexical variation during the course of this book. Suffice it to say that languages differ in how they demarcate many lexical domains including “color, space, body parts, motion, emotion, mental states, causality, and ordinary household containers” (Malt and Wolff [2010:5]). For now we survey some morphosyntactic variation via the consideration of some particularly salient examples of grammatical diversity.14
At the level of morphology, languages exhibit an impressive array of basic word structure types. Some languages allow words to consist of a long string of concatenated morphemes. Consider the following word from the aboriginal language Bininj Gun-wok (cited in Evans and Levinson [2009]): abanyawoihwarrgahmarneganjginjeng. This word is best translated with an entire clause

14 Interested readers unfamiliar with such variation may wish to consult typologically oriented surveys of morphosyntactic phenomena (e.g. Payne [1997], Givón [1984]).

55

in English: “I cooked the wrong meat for them again.” The Bininj Gun-wok word is equivalent in meaning, but consists of a number of morphemes that cannot occur independently as in the English clause – this difference is not simply a matter of orthographic convention. Typologists refer to a language like Bininj Gun-wok as an extremely polysynthetic language, meaning that it allows words to consist of a large number of morphemes. English also allows words to have more than one morpheme, though not to the same extent. In the English translation just cited, the word ‘cooked’ has two morphemes, one denoting a type of event (‘cook’), and the other indexing when that event occurred (‘-ed’). Clearly, though, English is less polysynthetic than Bininj Gunwok. Many languages allow even less morpheme synthesis than English. At the other end of the continuum of polysynthesis, when contrasted to languages like Bininj Gun-wok, are isolating languages such as Mandarin. In such languages, few if any words consist of more than one morpheme. In other words, seemingly basic categories such as tense and number, which English expresses via verbal and nominal suffixes, respectively, are not denoted via word inflections. So while some languages are particularly polysynthetic, others are isolating, and most fall somewhere in between. It is difficult to imagine how languages could vary more along this dimension.
In addition, languages allow morphemes to be attached to words in every way conceivable. The most common kinds of affixes are prefixes and suffixes, both of which are evident in an English word such as ‘deconfigured’. It might seem that the beginnings and ends of words are the only places where affixes might be attached. It turns out, however, that languages also allow affixes to occur word-medially. This strategy is popular in particular among Austronesian languages. For example, in Bontok the word fikas means to ‘be strong’, while the word fumikas means to ‘become strong’. (Payne [1997:30]) In other words, a -um- infix is employed to denote the transitional sense of the latter word. Languages also utilize morphemes that are comprised of two segments, one of which is obligatorily attached to the front of a root and the other of which is obligatorily added to the end of the root. The most well known example of a circumfix (to speakers of European languages anyway) is likely that denoting the past participle in German verbs such as gespielt. The root in this case is the verb spielen, ‘to play’, to which the circumfix ge–t is attached at both ends.
Clearly, there is extensive variation in morphological form across the world’s languages. Some languages don’t allow more than one morpheme per word, others allow a few, and others allow a large number. For those languages that allow the combination of multiple morphemes in one word, this combination may occur in a variety of ways. Some of these, such as prosodic combinations, have not even been touched on here.

56

Acknowledging diversity

Morphological diversity is not simply of matter of different kinds of forms, however. Such diversity also surfaces in a way that more obviously impinges on the issue of linguistic relativity, namely the variety of semantic and pragmatic categories denoted morphologically. Here the diversity is even more impressive. Consider a category as seemingly basic as tense. In English we have tense suffixes denoting whether an event occurred in the past, present, or future. It may be difficult to imagine verbs without such tense inflection. Yet tense inflection is much less basic than it may seem, and as many as half of the world’s languages lack this morphological category (Bybee [1985]). Furthermore, those that do code for tense do so in myriad ways. Languages with past, present, and future distinctions are in the decided minority, and many languages appeal to a two-way distinction between future and non-future or past and non-past. In Karitiâna, for example, the future/non-future strategy is adopted. The word ytakatat means ‘I went/am going’ (though usually the former). When an –i future suffix is added, the resultant word ytakatari means ‘I will go’. Verbs without a suffix denote events that are not in the future, and verbs with an -i suffix denote events that are. While there are only two tense distinctions in Karitiâna and many other languages, there are three in English, and even more in others. For instance, in Yagua there are seven tenses indexed morphologically (Payne [1997:236]).
Seemingly basic meaning categories such as tense and number vary significantly across languages, but the morphological instantiation of such categories is itself quite common, i.e. many languages have tense and number distinctions of some kind. There is another sort of morphological variation, though, variation in the kinds of categories to which individual languages appeal. Many category types only occur in a small subset of human languages. One sort of category that occurs in approximately a quarter of the world’s languages is direct “evidentiality” (Aikhenvald [2004]). Evidential morphemes are used to denote the manner in which the information described in a clause was ascertained. For example, in the New Guinean language Fasu, a verbal circumfix must be used to denote information that was gathered visually. The word ape-re means ‘I see it coming’. The root in this case, pe, means ‘come’. The remainder of the meaning is conveyed via the visual evidential circumfix. (Loeweke and May [1980:71]) In the Muskogean language Koasati, on the other hand, an auditory evidential is often employed. The verb aksóhka-ha, for example, might be uttered when something nearby is charring. In this case the –ha suffix at the end of the word denotes the fact that the speaker can hear something charring. (Kimball [1991:207])
Many inflectional categories are less common than evidential affixes, for instance desiderative affixes. Such affixes are employed when speakers express

57

someone’s desire, likely their own, for a particular event to occur. In Karitiâna, for example, the verbal suffix –wak serves this function. So while the verb pyt’y means ‘to eat’, the verb pyt’ywak means ‘want to eat’. Suffixes with similar functions are employed in languages such as Japanese and Sanskrit, yet desideratives are not particularly common.
More unusual categories are not hard to uncover either. One category that is familiar to linguists but is relatively uncommon is mirativity. Mirative morphemes are employed to denote events whose occurrence was somehow unexpected. In Turkish, for example, a suffix –mIs is attached to verbs in such cases. If it is attached to the verb root gel meaning ‘to come’, for example, the speaker is denoting an arrival that surprised them: Kemal gel-mIs means ‘Kemal, surprisingly, came’. (Payne [1997:255])
The categories discussed here are of course just a sample of those evident in the morphologies of the world’s languages. Numerous other morphological distinctions could be adduced, many of which would seem exotic to speakers of English. As linguists have begun to analyze data from a greater sample of the world’s languages, they have confronted a greater range of morphological diversity. This is not to suggest that certain tendencies do not surface – as in the case of sounds they certainly do. For instance, more languages express tense distinctions than evidentiality distinctions. Languages utilize suffixes at a greater rate than infixes. And so on. Nevertheless, despite such tendencies, there is no clear upper limit on the number of morphological categories exhibited by the world’s existing languages, not to mention the sum of all languages ever spoken.
A similar conclusion can be reached with respect to the last branch of phenomena treated in this brief survey of linguistic diversity: syntax. The most obvious syntactic sort of diversity evident in crosslinguistic surveys is the broad range of word orders permitted by the world’s languages. If we take transitive sentences that consist of a subject, object, and verb,15 for instance, the word order of English is typically S-V-O, e.g. “The jaguar ate the person.” It is often difficult or impossible to establish the basic word order of a given language, though, and English is a particularly clear-cut case. Even if we restrict our attention to those cases where some sort of basic word order can be arrived at, there is remarkable variability across languages. (Dryer [1997]) It seems clear that, of the six orders in which S, V, and O can occur, some are more common than others. SOV ordering such as that evident in Japanese or Turkish is quite

15 Such terms are descriptively useful, but are not meant to imply universality. What is a subject in one language is not necessarily reified grammatically in another. See, for example, the discussions in Croft (2001).

58

Acknowledging diversity

common, as is SVO. VSO ordering is also not uncommon, and VOS has been attested for some time. Until the 1970’s it was theorized that object-initial default word orders did not exist. As in so many other cases of claims regarding universal characteristics of language, however, such supposedly impermissible features eventually cropped up. In this case, several exceptions surfaced in Amazonia, most famously the Hixkaryana language (Derbyshire [1979]), whose most basic word order is O-V-S. In this language, the back-translation to a clause such as “The jaguar ate the person,” would read something like “The person ate the jaguar.” Hixkaryana speakers comprehend the last noun of the clause to represent the entity performing rather than undergoing a given action.
Equally extreme examples of syntactic variation, at least from the perspective of speakers of a language such as English that is characterized by rigid word order, are those cases in which languages permit words to come in any number of orders. Latin is perhaps the most famous case of such a “free word order” language. What is particularly remarkable about such languages is that their so-called constituents (like noun phrases or verb phrases) can be separated by other words. In clause (2.1) an adjective occurs at the opposite end of the clause with respect to the noun it modifies:

(2.1) ultima Cumaei venit iam

carminis aetas

last

Cumae come now song

Age

‘The last age of the Cumaean song has now arrived.’ (Matthews

[1981:255], cited also in Evans and Levinson [2009:441])

This clause represents just one of the many permissible orders in which these same words could be strung together. Such clauses were intelligible to Latin speakers since the language utilized an extensive case system to disambiguate semantic roles. In general, languages with extensive case systems are less reliant on conventionalized word orders for the expression of meaning.
Another major way in which languages exhibit syntactic diversity, and the last we will consider here, is through variation in the sorts of “pivots” they employ. The term pivot refers to a syntactic characteristic that typically correlates with the semantic agent and the pragmatic topic in a given clause. These attributes are often combined into a category called “subject”, but in the case of a number of languages they are not. The syntactic pivot surfaces when a gap in a given clause refers implicitly to a preceding overt noun phrase. For example, in the clause “The woman slapped the man and Ø laughed,” the gapped or implicit element (Ø) refers to the agent of the clause, the woman. Speakers of English omit the second occurrence of “the woman” and do not need to refer to her pronominally either. In Dyirbal (Dixon 1972), the transla-

59

tion of this clause would take the following form: yibinggu yara bunjun Ø miyandanyu. Here, though, the “gap” or omitted element refers not to the woman (yibinggu) but to the man (yara). In other words, the syntactic pivot in Dyirbal does not link an omitted element with the preceding agent, in this case the person doing the slapping. This sort of gapping strategy is part of a larger phenomenon known as ergativity (Dixon [1994]), a phenomenon that has caused many linguists to question whether the notion of “subject” is universal to all languages. At the least such examples have allowed linguists to realize that the syntactic pivots in some languages (e.g. English) are associated with agents, and in a much smaller number of languages (e.g. Dyirbal) they are associated with the entities that are undergoing an action (in the case in question, being slapped). In some languages, the syntactic pivot is unlike either that in English or Dyirbal, since it is not definitively associated with either the agent or the undergoer of an action. Karitiâna represents just such a case. When clauses are decontextualized the pivot is completely ambiguous. Consider (2.2):

(2.2) nonso

nakamit taso

pyrypykynan Ø

woman

hit

man

ran

(gap)16

‘The woman hit the man and she/he ran.’

As we see in this example, the gapped element at the end of the clause may refer to either antecedent noun phrase, either the man or the woman. Karitiâna speakers rely on contextual cues to establish co-reference in such cases.
The syntactic pivot strategies utilized by languages clearly evince a profound sort of diversity. As in the case of object-initial word orders, the discovery of non-agentively-oriented pivots violated the expectations of many. This discovery, like that of unusual word orders, resulted from the careful description of lesser-known languages.
While we have only surveyed a few morphological and syntactic phenomena, the preceding examples serve to make our point: the diversity of morphosyntax evident in the world’s languages is extreme, and often violates expectations based on centuries of careful examination of European languages. This extreme diversity is only apparent once unrelated languages in far-flung corners of the world are analyzed in detail. In the light of such diversity, the suggestion that linguistic diversity may play some role in cognitive diversity does not seem implausible. It seems quite possible, for instance, that Dyirbal speakers, Karitiâna speakers, and English speakers may conceptualize aspects of agency in different ways, given that their languages’ syntactic pivots require

16 This is a simplified gloss, omitting morphemes that are irrelevant to this discussion.

60

them to index agency to varying degrees. While I have no experimental support for this suggestion, the idea does not seem particularly implausible in the light of the linguistic data.
There are common constraints on language production and comprehension shared by all humans, e.g. restrictions of short and long-term memory, limitations in the innervation of muscles used in articulation, biological constraints on the ability to perceptually discriminate certain acoustic signals, etc. Nevertheless, languages are so diverse that it is increasingly difficult for linguists to maintain once-commonly-held assumptions about many linguistic categories. One noted typologically oriented linguist describes the current state of affairs as follows:
Thus, descriptive linguists still have no choice but to adopt the Boasian approach of positing special language-particular categories for each language. Theorists often resist it, but the crosslinguistic evidence is not converging on a smallish set of possibly innate categories. On the contrary, almost every newly described language presents us with some “crazy” new category that hardly fits existing taxonomies. (Haspelmath [2007:119])
Haspelmath’s claims are made in the light of the extensive and ever-growing surveys of the lexical-grammatical structures of the world’s languages, most prominently the World Atlas of Linguistic Structures (Haspelmath et al. [2011]).
In addition to the diverse practices associated with language acquisition across the world’s cultures (Ochs and Schieffelin [1983]), and the diverse patterns associated with discourse, verbal play, and verbal art (Hymes [2001]), diversity in the structure of spoken languages clearly abounds. And of course linguistic diversity extends beyond spoken languages, as we have noted, since language can be produced with the hands, or heard in a series of beeps, or understood by touching a series of bumps, or read with ideograms, or read with sound-based symbols, etc. Perhaps the single most impressive feature of human language is in fact the diversity it exhibits.

2.4 Conclusion
In this chapter we have drawn attention to some of the variation in human cognition across cultures, and also to the extreme variation that characterizes extant spoken languages–which represent only a slice of the language pie that has existed to date. Based on the extent of these two broad sorts of variation, we conclude that the hypothesis that linguistic variation plays some role in fostering cognitive variation is not implausible. Nevertheless, it is a hypothesis that requires empirical substantiation, and the mere existence of cognitive and linguistic variation does not constitute substantiation.

3 Refining methodology
3.1 Methodological issues to be addressed
In this chapter we discuss some of the methodological implements currently available in the toolkits of researchers concerned with exploring a causal role of linguistic variance in cases of cross-cultural cognitive variance. These implements have been honed so as to address the issues sometimes associated with work on this topic, particularly the three primary issues outlined in the first chapter: “circularity”, “confirmation bias”, and the “apparent inextricability of linguistic influences on thought”.
Well-established diversities of the sort discussed in the preceding chapter suggest that a relativistic account is not precluded by factors such as the putative universality of language, or the psychological homogeneity of humankind. Since such universality and homogeneity is still often presupposed, our first task was to dispel such notions. Nevertheless, even if one accepts the suggestion made above and elsewhere in the literature that significant cognitive and linguistic diversity exist across human populations, this acknowledgement does not necessitate the acceptance of meaningful linguistic effects on nonlinguistic cognition. It is possible after all that cultural-historical factors, aside from language, have helped foster both linguistic diversity and cognitive diversity, and that linguistic diversity has not played any role in promoting cognitive diversity.
How then do we establish that there exists a relationship between the two sorts of diversity we have delineated, particularly in the unidirectional sense we are concerned with here, i.e. how do we establish that linguistic diversity itself helps to promote cognitive diversity? This is actually a tricky question to answer definitively, and the truth is that there are clear methodological obstacles, some of which were outlined in Chapter 1, that must be circumvented in careful research on this issue. In his discussions of work on the linguistic relativity hypothesis, and in his re-envisioning of contemporary work on the subject, Lucy (1992a, 1997, 2004) presents a tripartite distinction of basic methodological strategies adopted in studies on the subject. According to Lucy, such strategies can be categorized as “structure-centered”, “domain-centered”, or “behavior-centered”, and each of these approaches has characteristic strengths and weaknesses. This categorization serves as a useful starting point for our discussion of methodology (though not all studies surveyed in this book fit naturally into one of these categories), so let us address each in turn.
“Structure-centered” approaches are characterized by a focus on some set of differences between given languages. The assumption of those adopting this

62

Refining methodology

approach, traditionally at least, is that different semantic structures in two or more given languages implicitly reflect differences in the conceptions of their speakers with respect to relevant ontological categories. This approach characterizes Whorf’s research, for instance his work on the construal of time among English and Hopi speakers. Whorf (1956) noted, for example, that English speakers treat temporal units as discrete substances via their denotation as nouns, e.g. days, months, years, etc. Hopi speakers, according to Whorf, construe time in a less discrete manner, judging from the way temporal events are indexed in Hopi. Accepting for the moment Whorf’s claims on Hopi grammar, though, the limitations of a strict structure-centered approach are evident: As discussed in Chapter 1, in order to make claims about the nonlinguistic cognition of a language’s speakers, we actually need evidence outside the linguistic realm. Claims for linguistic relativity based entirely on a language’s structure are patently circular. Fortunately, the structure-centered approach has been refined and expanded. While still utilizing structural differences between languages as a point of departure, researchers adopting this approach now use relevant linguistic differences to generate hypotheses on nonlinguistic cognitive dissimilarities, and then test these hypotheses experimentally with nonverbal tasks. A variety of studies surveyed in this book could be considered structure-centered according to Lucy’s taxonomy.
Rather than utilizing a given set of differences between languages as a point of departure, “domain-centered” studies are focused from the outset on a particular cognitive or experiential domain, for instance the categorization of color or the perception of space. Researchers survey the manner in which the given domain is encoded linguistically in a number of languages, in order to ascertain whether there is indirect linguistic evidence for differentiated conceptualization of the domain in question. One potential weakness of the domain-centered approach is the same as that noted for the structure-centered approach, namely that researchers may restrict their attention to the linguistic encoding of a particular domain, and draw conclusions on nonlinguistic cognition based on linguistic differences only. Ironically perhaps, the most notable misstep in the literature associated with this approach resulted in strong antirelativistic claims. As we will see in greater detail in Chapter 7, a number of findings on color naming across the world’s languages demonstrated that there were implicational universals in the way in which color terms are coded linguistically. These universal linguistic encoding strategies were taken as strong evidence that color perception does not vary across human populations. While some experimental work seemed to offer support for this claim (Rosch 1972), the claims on universal patterns of color construal were based primarily on the linguistic data associated with this domain. Once careful experimental work on

Methodological issues to be addressed

63

the actual perception of color was undertaken, though, cross-group differences in color perception began to surface. It turns out these differences correspond with differences in color terms, despite the existence of common lexical patterns associated with the domain. The domain-centered approach has more recently been employed in dozens of studies on spatial orientation, some of which are discussed in the following chapter.17
The “behavior-centered” approach adopts a different tack, and is focused on explaining some noticeable difference in the behavior of two human populations by uncovering a linguistic source for the noticed behavioral difference. One example of this approach is Bloom’s (1981, 1984) work on counterfactual reasoning, discussed in Chapter 10. Bloom began with the observation that Chinese speakers exhibited difficulty in answering questions requiring counterfactual or hypothetical reasoning. With this observation in hand, he sought a linguistic explanation, and concluded that the differentiated way in which counterfactuals are marked in English and Mandarin plausibly explained the poor performance of the Chinese respondents. To his credit, he provided experimental data in support of this conclusion, however the stimuli used in the experiments were subsequently shown to be problematic (Au [1983], Liu [1985]). Nevertheless, one gets a sense from Bloom’s work of the form of the behavior-centered approach. This approach has been adopted in other work, but most contemporary work on linguistic relativity cannot be characterized as behavior-centered. Perhaps this is the case because the approach suffers from an over-reliance on post-hoc reasoning: If one is searching for a linguistic motivator for behavioral differences that have already been observed, some linguistic difference might surface as a viable candidate. Yet the selection of such a candidate on intuitive grounds does not preclude the possibility that a number of other cultural or linguistic factors might be involved. Most contemporary work takes a more subtle tack of beginning with linguistic differences, perhaps associated with a given domain only, and generating testable hypotheses on how such differences in language might foster differences in cognition. The choice to begin with behavioral differences runs the risk of generating more deterministic-like claims on the interaction of language and behavior, while potentially ignoring other factors that might motivate the behavioral disparities in question.

17 In this book categories of experiential and cognitive domains like color perception, quantity recognition, and the like, are treated separately. Structuring our discussions according to domains allows for us to consider the relevant work in cohesive chunks. It should be noted, though, that many of the individual studies considered are not “domain-centered” when considered in isolate.

Refining methodology

The three broad approaches described by Lucy are useful starting points in a discussion of methodology, though like many heuristic taxonomies this tripartite grouping represents somewhat of an oversimplification. After all, many contemporary studies exhibit characteristics of more than one approach. For example, in our discussion of quantity recognition among speakers of the anumeric language Pirahã (in Chapter 6), we will see that the relevant studies are in some sense structure-centered, domain-centered, and behavior-centered. Much of the initial impetus for understanding numerical cognition among the Pirahã owed itself to outsiders’ observations of their behavior. Later careful descriptions of the structure of terms for approximate quantities in their language further motivated experimental work on their quantity discrimination abilities, by several researchers (including myself). These careful descriptions were informed by other studies in the semantic domain of quantity representation, across numerous languages. So the studies on Pirahã numerical cognition could be considered structure-centered, domain-centered, behavior-centered, or some combination thereof.
Ultimately, studies on linguistic relativity should arrive at some similar place involving claims about the interaction between linguistic structure and nonlinguistic cognition, associated with a particular experiential domain and possibly with overt behavioral norms. With this similar end-point in mind we might think of the three suggested major methodological approaches as descriptions of starting points only, e.g. rather than characterizing a study as structure-centered, we might characterize it as structure-motivated. Differing initial foci may draw attention to potentially relativistic processes in divergent fashions, but once that attention is generated, the resultant studies should hopefully offer something for all concerned about the nexus of language and other types of cognitive processes.
It is by now clear that systematic investigations on linguistic relativity, whether motivated by structural or behavioral disparities, or concerned with better understanding a given experiential domain, are a recent innovation. Given the various ramifications of a careful understanding of linguistic influences on thought, this recency is perhaps puzzling. The motivations for the recency are in some cases theoretical, as discussed in the first chapter. They are also methodological, though. Ultimately careful examinations of potential cases of relativity entail both detailed linguistic fieldwork and the concomitant adoption of experimental tools and associated statistical analyses. These sorts of methods, the linguistic and the experimental, differ significantly in practice. The fact of the matter is that many linguists are well equipped for describing languages, but unfamiliar with the methods common to psychologists and others who commonly undertake experimental tasks on human cognitive proc-

esses. Conversely, many of the latter camp are unfamiliar with the detailed linguistic analysis that is foundational for some studies on the interaction of language structure and thought. This is somewhat inevitable, as it would of course be impracticable for all those interested in human cognition to be familiar with the minutia of morphosyntactic analyses. And extensive understanding of experimental and statistical methods would offer little payback to the research program of many field linguists. Whether or not this characterization holds going forward is another matter, however. Many graduate programs in linguistics now require students to take courses on experimental methods that are common to other branches of the social and cognitive sciences. Furthermore, there is an ever-growing reliance on quantitative approaches to linguistic analysis.18 (Johnson [2008], Eddington [2009]) Despite the trend towards greater sharing of methods across fields in the cognitive sciences, though, for some time there has been inadequate cross-disciplinary interaction, and this inadequacy at least partially explains the recency of serious inquiries into linguistic relativity.
So how can experimental methods and traditional descriptive tools be utilized synergistically to arrive at a better understanding of the issues? The short answer to this question is that there are a number of ways, and these ways will only become sufficiently clear during the remainder of this book, as the strategies of various researchers are considered in turn. Still, we can sketch here some of the recurring strategies evident in the studies. First, researchers must establish the way in which two (or more languages) differ lexically or morphosyntactically. This is done via original fieldwork, or through the examination of previous reliable field studies. The challenges of linguistic fieldwork, particularly that carried out with little-documented languages in remote locales, are numerous. Once the onerously acquired results of such work are scrutinized, some significant differences between the described language and some other described language(s) (often a widely spoken Indo-European one) inevitably surface. These differences may relate to some other aspect of the culture in question, and ethnographic accounts may play a crucial role in establishing whether there is some behavioral feature of the society in question that correlates with the linguistic divergence. In some cases, though, researchers may be interested in a linguistic feature that would not be expected to

18 In some linguistic fields such as quantitative sociolinguistics (e.g. Labov [1966, 2001]) or experimental phonetics (e.g. Beddor and Strange [1982], Solé, Beddor, and Ohala [2007]), such methods were adopted some time ago. However in work on morphology and syntax, which more directly relates to the subject of linguistic relativity, this adoption has generally been more recent.

correspond to any overt nonlinguistic facet of the culture in question. Such a feature may in fact prove to be of particular interest, since its subsequent correlation with cognitive variation of some kind is less likely to be ascribable to general cultural factors.
Once the crosslinguistic differences are established, hypotheses may be generated regarding potential nonlinguistic cognitive effects of these differences. This is when the experimental methods prove handy. A nonlinguistic task, or an assortment of such tasks, must be designed and carried out among representative samples of speakers of the languages in question. The kinds of tasks that could be utilized are potentially limitless, but in practice they tend to fall into basic task categories that are familiar to cognitive scientists. These include reaction-time tasks, triad-discrimination tasks, tests of recall, and the like. Once the task or assortment of tasks is run with the populations in questions, the results obtained are quantified. Assuming a quantifiable disparity between populations results, this disparity is tested for statistical significance to establish that the results are not merely due to chance. For results to be considered significant, the odds of their being due to chance must be less than 5% (p<0.05) or, more desirably, 1% (p<0.01). The statistical tests adopted vary according to the structure of the experimental design, including the number of factors involved, and according to whether the resultant data are parametric or nonparametric. Frequently employed tests include Chi-square, Fisher’s exact test, t-tests, analyses of variance (ANOVA’s), logistic regression, and other procedures common to the social sciences.
Once a statistically significant disparity between populations is established for a given task or set of tasks, researchers have some evidence that the previously established linguistic disparity may in fact influence nonlinguistic cognition. At this stage, though, the strength of this evidence is debatable. After all, the correlation between a linguistic disparity and a particular nonlinguistic cognitive disparity may be due to some confounding variable. The sorts of potential confounding variables that need to be ruled out vary in accordance with the linguistic features in question, as well as the cultures of the populations being tested. How then do we establish the influence of a linguistic feature on a nonlinguistic feature, when all we have is correlation between the two for a particular task? There are various approaches to circumventing this “correlation” obstacle. One way is to introduce the speakers of one language with a linguistic feature from another, and to see whether this familiarization leads to changes in their nonlinguistic strategies. This approach is adopted for instance in Boroditsky [2001], discussed in Chapter 5. A newer approach is to present stimuli differentially (in a given task) to the two cerebral hemispheres. If the cross-population differences are more pronounced with respect to stimuli

presented to the left hemisphere where language primarily resides in most people, this hemispheric effect hints that language disparities are most directly responsible for the differences in nonlinguistic cognition across populations. This approach is exemplified by Gilbert et al. (2006), discussed in Chapter 7.
Some cultural contexts are not amenable to such tactics, however, and in many cases all that can be definitively established is the correlation between a facet of the structure of a language and an aspect of nonlinguistic cognition. Nevertheless, if such linguistic-cognitive correspondence is established via multiple tasks, this correlation may infuse relativistic conclusions with a substantial degree of plausibility. While in theory correlation does not necessitate a causal relationship, the data might be most simply and directly explained via an account suggesting a causal role of language on nonlinguistic thought. In fact, there might be no plausible alternate accounts. The onus is on the researcher(s) in question, of course, to carefully consider and eliminate alternate explanations for their findings, and to convince readers of their interpretation.
Assuming that experiments have demonstrated (at least with some high degree of plausibility) the role of crosslinguistic disparities for a particular cognitive task, yet another lurking factor must be systematically taken into consideration: A linguistic feature could influence the results on a cognitive task, but only because speakers have appealed to language–perhaps as a last resort–to help them complete what may be to them an odd task. In other words, the results may be due to linguistic factors but not because the linguistic feature under investigation typically influences the speakers’ nonlinguistic cognition. Instead, the results of the experiment(s) may simply say something about the strategies used by speakers during a given experiment. The adoption of such linguistically influenced strategies in experimental settings is not necessarily insignificant (as it does reflect the influence of language on thought), but it may offer little insight about speakers’ day-to-day thought related to the cognitive domain being tested. One way this variable can be accounted for is by designing tasks so that participants cannot develop any one strategy for completing an experiment, or designing tasks so that their relationship to any relevant feature(s) of the participants’ language is not transparent. Another way to account for this variable is through the usage of verbal interference during a particular task, in order to prevent respondents from relying on their language faculties simply to complete a given task. If differences across populations persist or are exacerbated during verbal interference, it is easier to make the case that the results are due to general cross-group cognitive differences that have become ingrained through previous linguistic practice, rather than through the use of language during the given task. If the differences

68

Refining methodology

disappear once participants are presented with a verbal interference task, however, this finding suggests that the cross-population differences are almost definitely due to linguistic factors. However, such a verbal-interference effect also suggests that the cross-population differences owe themselves to disparate online linguistic processing used during the experiment(s), rather than to deeper, more general cognitive disparities between the groups. The verbal interference method is used for example in Gilbert et al. [2006], examined in Chapter 7.
The methods characterizing this research will crystallize during the surveys presented in chapters four through ten. For now, though, it is worth illustrating the general approach being suggested through the discussion of a brief, hypothetical example. Recall that in the first chapter we noted that Karitiâna has no analog for the word “monkey”. Rather than having a cover term for the range of species entailed by that term, speakers of this language use more specific terms for the animals in question, for instance õrõm (‘ateles paniscus’) and pikõm (‘cebus apella’). We also suggested that certain aspects of the Karitiânas’ behavior seem consistent with the notion that they think about these species in very distinct ways, compared to speakers of a language like English that groups them with the common term “monkey”. Intuitively at least, the linguistic taxonomy seems to enforce or reenforce the given conceptual taxonomy. How might I investigate this potential linguistic-conceptual connection, though? More specifically, how would I explore the potentially causal role of the linguistic on the conceptual in this case?19
The first step, given that the relevant linguistic description is already at our disposal, would be to design a nonlinguistic task to be administered to speakers of Karitiâna and speakers of another language (or languages) with a commonly-appealed-to cover term for “monkey”. Ideally this would be the language of another hunter-gatherer Amazonian tribe, allowing us to reduce some of the obvious conflating cultural variables such as degree of familiarity with the monkeys in question. What sort of task might we design to test for disparities in the conceptualization of monkey types? There are numerous candidates, so let me offer one: We could present a series of images of monkeys, perhaps via computer screen, to the two pools of experiment participants. Each speaker would be presented individually with several images at a time, of monkeys from a variety of relevant species familiar to the participants. Perhaps the images might depict portions of the bodies, or the bodies might be visually obstructed to increase confusability. For each presentation of images, one of

Methodological issues to be addressed

69

the images would represent one species, say ateles paniscus, and the remainder would represent a different species, say cebus apella. For each set of images, the speakers would be told to select the image that most differs from the others, though the images might differ in numerous ways besides monkey species. Now let us assume that, after repeated trials with dozens of image types and groupings, the Karitiâna speakers are found to more consistently discriminate (at a statistically significant rate) images according to e.g. the ateles paniscus-cebus apella distinction, while speakers of the other indigenous language(s) in question, with a cover term akin to “monkey”, tend to exhibit greater perceptual confusability between the monkey types. Findings on categorical perception suggest unequivocally that people are more likely to confuse members within conceptually cohesive categories, so the greater relative confusability of the non-Karitiâna would suggest that those speakers tend to think of the relevant species in a more monolithic manner, when contrasted to the Karitiâna speakers. Put differently, the Karitiâna language might be responsible for its speakers’ greater perceptual acuity vis-à-vis the monkey distinctions in question.
Assuming that we uncovered such a significant disparity for the cognitive task in question, how might we best establish that it is most likely due to the linguistic disparity between the two populations? One option might be to familiarize some Karitiâna (perhaps children) with a cover term for “monkey”, and to see if their familiarity with such a term had a deleterious effect on their discrimination abilities. In fact, given that many Karitiâna are familiar with the Portuguese term ‘macaco’, the results based on speakers familiar with this cover term might be contrasted with those unfamiliar with the term. In addition, we might utilize verbal interference during this and other discrimination tasks to eliminate the possibility that participants are using linguistic clues merely as means to complete the unusual tasks in question. Ultimately, we may discover some cross-population differences in the conceptual discrimination of monkey species, and might be able to formulate a plausible account suggesting that the monkey taxonomy of Karitiâna enhances its speakers’ species’ discrimination abilities. Or perhaps the results may suggest nothing of the sort. It is quite possible in fact (and to some reading this, extremely likely) that no significant cross-population disparities would surface through such a task. Until such tasks are conducted though, we certainly have little to offer in the way of a concrete relativistic account.
This is a completely illustrative exercise, of course, and I have not conducted any experiments of the sort suggested here on monkey perception. If I were to do so I might encounter unforeseen methodological obstacles to the approach suggested. Nevertheless, one can begin to get a sense of the ways

70

Refining methodology

we can address the methodological challenges posed by this sort of research. There are a number of procedural steps that must be taken, and confounding issues that must be addressed. The relevant studies in the literature do so with varying degrees of success. In the remainder of this text we will focus on work that could be characterized for the most part as methodologically refined, conducted by researchers well aware of the sorts of concerns described above.
Finally, it is worth noting in this discussion of methodology that most of the studies in the literature on linguistic relativity are structured around experiments carried out with adult populations. This is due in large measure to the fact that controlled research with children in the non-laboratory contexts of many indigenous cultures faces serious methodological obstacles. While most (though not all) of the studies are adult-focused, though, there is a clear recognition by researchers interested in the issue of linguistic relativity that data gathered among children are likely to play a crucial role in our eventual heightened understanding of the association between linguistic diversity and cognitive variation. There are various ways in which such research will likely play a role. For instance, ongoing cross-cultural research on human ontogeny might help us to better understand what sorts of cognitive strategies are universal to humans. The documentation of these universal strategies will allow us to clarify the sorts of semantic structures across languages that do not clearly reflect these universal strategies, and will allow us to see whether the universal strategies in question fail to develop or atrophy among speakers of languages characterized by the structures in question. In a related fashion, detailed descriptions of the acquisition of unrelated languages may be complimented with experimental data gathered with speakers of those languages related to particular experiential domains, in order to more carefully explore the ontogenetic processes through which language may begin to constrain or facilitate thought. In short, our future knowledge of linguistic relativity will hopefully be informed by careful cross-cultural studies of the development of linguistic skills and other facets of cognition. While child psychologists have generated an ever-growing body of knowledge on the role of language in cognitive development, few studies with young children have specifically addressed the potential role of crosslinguistic disparities in the development of different cognitive strategies across cultures.20 (Bowerman and Levinson [2001:14])

20 Work with other primates is also playing a role in growing our understanding of the influence of language on conceptual development (see Tomasello [2001]), though it is obviously limited in what it can tell us about the influence of crosslinguistic variation on cognition.

3.2 Conclusion
In our discussion of the common methodological approaches adopted in contemporary work on linguistic relativity, we have demonstrated how some wellestablished issues confronting such research can be handled. In the following chapters, the methodological approaches in question will come into focus more clearly, as they are exemplified in discussions of numerous explorations of the topic.

4.1 Introduction
Here is a simple task that you can try, wherever you may be while reading this: Point north. Or point south. Or point in any other cardinal direction. Can you do this confidently, without consulting the GPS on your phone, a map, or some other external technology? My guess is that you cannot, at least not with a great degree of confidence. The truth is, most readers of this book would not be able to do so. On a number of occasions I have asked all of the students in a large lecture hall to point north. Inevitably, what results is a room full of hands pointed in a variety of directions, with seemingly all of the headings of a 360° arc represented. Certainly there is little-to-no correlation between north and any pattern in the pointing. If you are located in a grid-like city such as Manhattan, where the avenues run (roughly) north to south, and the streets run east to west, you might find this task more manageable. Even in such cities, though, most of us tend to have pretty meager direction-recall abilities once we are indoors, especially once we have made a series of turns. This is perhaps not surprising, and you might wonder why anyone would expect that people could perform this task accurately. As Boroditsky and Gaby (2010) note, however, some 5-year-old speakers of Kuuk Thaayorre, an aboriginal language in Australia, point in any number of directions requested of them with uncanny accuracy. Boroditsky (2011) notes that, while she has seen such children perform this task with relative precision, her experience with speakers of English at institutions such as Harvard, Princeton, and Stanford suggests that they cannot with any reliability. She is not the only one to make this observation either. In a series of experiments, a number of groups of people besides the Kuuk Thaayorre have been shown to excel at this sort of task. In this chapter we will discuss this and other related research, much of which has been conducted by Stephen Levinson and his colleagues at the Max Planck Institute for Psycholinguistics. The common thread of the research is a consideration of the ways in which systematic crosslinguistic differences in spatial language yield systematic disparities in nonlinguistic cognition associated with spatial reference and orientation. This subject that has received attention in books dedicated entirely to the topic (Levinson [2003], Levinson and Wilkins [2006], Dasen and Mishra [2010]), and also in numerous articles in widely circulated journals (e.g. Pederson et al. [1998], Levinson et al. [2002], and Haun et al. [2011]). Given the breadth and depth of the relevant work in the literature, a caveat is in order: This chapter does not exhaustively survey the literature on

this topic. Instead, it focuses on some of the major findings presented in research on this cognitive domain, paying particular attention to the major experimental paradigms that have been implemented in the relevant investigations. Our primary goal will be to convey the state of the art of inquiries into this topic.
First, though, another illustrative task is in order, one that you could again undertake: Collect four objects within arm’s reach. On my desk I have a pen, a book, a cell phone, and key ring. Now take the four objects and place them in a randomly sequenced linear array on some horizontal surface in front of you. Then memorize the order of the objects in the line. Even though there are only four objects, this may require a modest amount of focus since the order is arbitrary. Have you memorized the order? Now shuffle the objects, collect them, and turn around 180° so that you are facing the opposite direction. Place the objects back down on a flat horizontal surface now in front of you, the floor if necessary. Be sure and arrange the objects in their original order, i.e. their order in the first linear array. Are you confident in your recall abilities? What order are the objects now in? You might respond that they are in the “same” order, but what does that mean exactly? My guess is that you employed a strategy such as the one I did, in which I memorized the order of the objects relative to the left and right sides of my body. That is, when I initially placed the objects on the desk in front of me, the pen was to the left of the book, which was to the left of the phone, which was to the left of the key ring. After turning around, I kept the objects in what was to me the same left-to-right order. This array reformation is represented schematically in Figure 4.1. This strategy seems intuitive to many, and may even seem like the “correct” answer. It is not the only strategy available, however. Consider Figure 4.2. The orientation strategy described by Figure 4.2 is another “correct” option. On an informal basis, I have conducted variations of this task numerous times

with over a dozen speakers of Karitiâna. In all cases the strategy they employed is that depicted in Figure 4.2, not the one depicted in Figure 4.1. The Karitiâna are not special in this regard, either. Many tested populations use the orientation strategy in Figure 4.2 as a default strategy. Differences in approach to this sort of recall task point to cross-group variations in an aspect of nonlinguistic spatial cognition.
In this chapter we will consider evidence for cross-group variation in nonlinguistic tasks, including dead reckoning tasks of the “point-north” variety and rotation-based tasks of the sort just described. We will consider claims that such variation is most plausibly motivated by fundamental divides in the way spatial orientation and spatial frames of reference are structured in different languages. Prior to tackling these topics, however, we should address another major way in which languages have been shown to vary vis-à-vis spatial semantics: spatial topology.
4.2 Spatial topology
Not all spatial language relates to the linear orientation of objects or places with respect to each other or the human perceiver. In fact, much spatial language relates to notions of spatial topology, specifically those such as convergence, containment, connectedness, contiguity, and general proximity. For example, English particles such as “in”, “on”, and “under” denote spatial relationships of proximity, containment (in the case of “in”) and vertical continuity (“on” and “under”). It has been suggested that such concepts correspond to extremely basic elements of neurocognition shared across the human species (Landau and Jackendoff [1993]), and this position would seem to predict the

75

universality of the linguistic reification of such concepts. Such universality would also be predicted by suggestions in the literature that these seemingly basic topological notions are ontogenetically primitive (Piaget and Inhelder [1956]), i.e. that children have some innate set of basic topological notions such as “in”, “on”, and “under”, which they bring to the table prior to the acquisition of their native language. According to such a perspective, children match the adpositional spatial terms of their languages early on (Johnston and Slobin [1979]) to pre-linguistic concepts of spatial topology. These predictions of universality confront serious challenges, though, upon careful consideration of the crosslinguistic utilization and acquisition of topological terms.
Perhaps the most well known way in which languages systematically vary in how they encode topological notions is the variety of means through which the path of a referent’s motion is described. One way in which languages encode such concepts for event-path description is through adpositions, for instance the English prepositions “in”, “on”, “out”, “over”, etc., as in “He walked out”. Germanic languages such as English, which tend to rely on adpositions for event-path descriptions, are often referred to as “satellite-framed” languages and contrasted with “verb-framed” languages (Talmy [2000]). In verb-framed languages, including Romance languages such as Portuguese, the path of the event (outwards in the example just cited) is typically denoted without reliance on an adposition, as in Ele saiu (‘He went out’). The distinction between satellite-framed languages and verb-framed languages is far from dichotomous, and languages may have ways of expressing topological notions

through either strategy, for instance English can employ verbs to express “in” and “out” paths through Latin-based verbs such as “enter” or “exit”, respectively. Nevertheless, this typological distinction gives us some sense of the sort of variability that exists in the grammatical realization of topological notions.21
Apart from the formal variation in the ways in which topological distinctions are conveyed, there exists a more profound sort of semantic variation of topological concepts. This variation is evidenced by the fact that some languages do not exhibit a distinction between “on” and “over”, a distinction that is sometimes erroneously assumed to be universal. Consider clause (4.1), which was elicited from several Karitiâna speakers independently after they were asked to describe the scene depicted in Figure 4.3.

Crucially, the postposition okyp is used when an item whose location is being highlighted, the “figure” (in this case bywo, ‘lamp’), is in a linear vertical relationship vis-à-vis another item, the “landmark” or “ground” (in this case pytypa, ‘table’). While the figure is necessarily near the landmark, its position cannot be described with okyp if it is under the landmark or contiguous with the bottom surface of that landmark. It can be described with this term only if it is located above the landmark or contiguous with the top surface of that landmark. In other words clause (4.1) may refer to cases such as that depicted in Figure 4.3, but it also may be used when a lamp is found directly on top of a table. The word okyp is also elicited when Karitiâna speakers are presented with images such as that in Figure 4.4, which is describable via clause (4.2). In short, the concepts of “over” and “on” cannot be linguistically dissociated in the language, at least not via a simple adpositional distinction as in English.

In fact, many languages conflate topological distinctions that exist in other languages, while distinguishing topological notions that are conflated in others. Consider that English “on” conflates the Dutch distinction between op and

21 In fact, topological notions may even be represented in other parts of the clause, for instance via locative case markers. (See Levinson [2003:98–110] for a survey.)

aan. The latter Dutch term is typically used to refer to situations in which the figure must counteract gravity to stay “on” the landmark, for instance a piece of fruit on a tree branch. Conversely, English makes a distinction between figures being “on” or “in” landmarks, while other languages may conflate these distinctions via the usage of one term, for instance the Spanish particle en.22
While crosslinguistic surveys of such distinctions are limited by the scarcity of quality data available, it seems clear from the extant surveys such as that in Levinson et al. (2003) that there are no topological concepts that are universally codified in the world’s languages. This is not to suggest that there are no crosslinguistic tendencies related to spatial topology. In fact, Levinson et al. (2003) suggest that there are certain semantic “attractors”, or topological notions that are frequently codified. One such attractor is the okyp (‘on/over’) spatial category evident in Karitiâna and many other languages. Other attractor notions are glossed in Levinson et al. (2003) as “in”, “attachment”, “near/ under”, and “on-top”. While such notions are common, they are hardly universal, as evidenced by the fact that “on/over”, “attachment”, and “near/under” are not coded as unitary concepts in English prepositions.23
The question that naturally arises in discussing such topological variability is whether this variability implies disparities in speakers’ actual perceptions of spatial relationships between objects. For example, do Karitiâna speakers
22 English does not rigidly enforce the on/in semantic distinction. There are numerous idiomatic exceptions. Hence I can speak of being “on the bus” or “on the plane”, or “in my chair”. 23 Some are more likely to be codified in a given language than others, and Levinson et al. (2003:510) go so far as to posit an implicational hierarchy of topological notions, though they note that this hierarchy must be interpreted with caution.

perceive the relationships in Figures 4.3 and 4.4 to be more similar than English speakers do? Some evidence from language acquisition is at least consistent with the claim that the differentiated semantic structuring of topological notions has demonstrable effects on the manner in which some spatial relationships are perceived. Building on previous work on the acquisition of spatial terms (e.g. Bowerman [1994, 1996a, 1996b]), Bowerman and Choi (2001) contrasted the way in which English-speaking and Korean-speaking one-to-three year-olds verbally discriminate topological categories. Their results suggest that, as early as eighteen months, speakers of the two languages exhibit differences in their topological concepts. These differences relate to lexical distinctions such as kkita vs. “in”. The former Korean word refers to a spatial relationship in which the figure is located in or on the landmark, but in a tight-fitting manner. The English word “in” makes no such requirement of tight-fittedness. Bowerman and Choi (2001) investigated whether young learners of these languages show signs of construing spatial relationships in accordance with such language-specific categories, or in accordance with some universal category. Put differently, they sought to uncover whether the construal of spatial relationships of each of the two groups of children was more similar to the other group’s construal, or more similar to that of the adult speakers of their own language. One task the authors conducted was video-based. Children between the ages of 18–23 months viewed videos of objects coming into spatial relationships, for example a peg being inserted in a tight-fitting hole, a Lego being put in a box, or a book being inserted in a tight-fitting box. In some cases the viewing involved the audio presentation of a descriptive question including a relevant spatial term, e.g. “Where’s she putting it IN?” or “Eti-ey KKI-e?” (‘Where’s [she] tight-fitting it?’). (Bowerman and Choi [2001:496]) When the spatial term in the audio stimulus matched the spatial relationship being witnessed visually, the young children stared longer at the visual stimulus. Given the crosslinguistic disparity, however, the actual stimuli stared at more intensively varied across the two groups. So, for example, Korean speakers had a tendency to stare longer at a video of Legos being put on other Legos in a tight-fitting way after hearing audio stimuli with kkita, while English speakers had a tendency to stare longer at a video of Legos being put in a box after hearing audio stimuli involving “in”. ‘Speakers’ is a bit of misnomer here since the majority of experimental participants were unable to produce the relevant words in either language. Yet they clearly comprehended the words on some level, and their attention to the video and audio stimuli was demonstrably affected by the topological categories of the language they were in the process of learning.
While researchers do not doubt that there are universal facets of human perception of spatial-topological concepts, work such as Bowerman and Choi

Frames of reference

(2001) implies that children do not bring a rigid set of topological concepts to the language-learning table. Were that the case, we might expect 18–23 months-old children to show similar orientation patterns associated with topological stimuli, regardless of differentiated linguistic stimuli. Instead, it appears that such patterns are shaped even before humans can appropriately produce the spatial terms in their language. From the moment we are able to observe such concepts in the behavior of children, they show signs of linguistic influence. Any universal biases that they do bring to language acquisition are apparently malleable. Topological notions take shape as children learn the relevant categories of their native languages.
Bowerman and Choi’s (2001) findings, along with others on the development of spatial categories, do not constitute unequivocal evidence for linguistic effects on nonlinguistic processes of spatial perception since their tasks involved linguistic stimuli. Yet the findings are useful for framing discussions of such effects, since they demonstrate the way in which language helps shape orientation towards spatial concepts at an extremely young age. They suggest strongly that nonlinguistic conceptual categories associated with the domain of space are not as strong or inflexible as is sometimes assumed. As the authors note, “This outcome is particularly striking because, of all semantic domains, space is the one that has been cited most often in arguments for the critical role of children’s autonomous concepts in early lexical development.” (2001:497)
Given that linguistic influences on the development of topological concepts are not prevented by any putative autonomous concepts, it would not be altogether surprising to find that there exist linguistic influences on the nonlinguistic conceptualization of space. In the next section we consider the evidence for such influences on spatial “frames of reference”, a facet of cognition that is more readily testable via nonlinguistic experimental inquiries.

4.3 Frames of reference
4.3.1 Experimental evidence
“Frames of reference” are basic ways to refer to coordinate systems when describing object positions (see Levinson [2003:24], Rock [1992:404] for more detailed definitions). For some time it has been known that speakers of some languages typically rely on an “absolute” (or “geocentric”) frame of reference (FoR) when supplying descriptions of the spatial configurations of a set of objects. In others, such as English, speakers have a marked tendency to rely on a “relative” (or “egocentric”) FoR. Consider again Figure 4.1. In this case, if

I were to describe the initial position of the phone on my desk, I might say that “the phone is to the left of the keys and to the right of the book,” assuming that I am viewing the items from the initial (top) perspective described by the figure. This is a crucial point, though. To know whether my characterization of the location of the phone is correct, based on the description just given, I have to know something about my position when I viewed the items. Were I to view the same items from the opposite side of my desk, the characterization offered would be incorrect. In short, this sort of description is based on a relative FoR since it depends on viewer positioning. Suppose though that I described the position of the phone as follows: “The phone is to the north of the keys and to the south of the book.” The FoR in this case is absolute, and this characterization would hold no matter which angle I viewed the items from. There is a long history of inquiry into types of frames of reference, in philosophy, psychology, and linguistics. (For a synopsis of that history, see Levinson [2003].) Various terminological choices have been made to discuss divergent frames of reference, but researchers on language and cognition seem to have settled on a basic set of terms. On the one hand, frames of reference can be referred to as egocentric or relative when they rely on the speaker’s perspective at the time of description of the orientation of particular objects. On the other, they may be referred to as “allocentric”, in which case the positioning of the objects is described via a more fixed feature of the environment. If they are allocentric, they may be further categorized as “absolute/geocentric” or “intrinsic”.24 An absolute or geocentric FoR utilizes some cardinal direction system, for instance as in the preceding description of the phone’s northern position. An intrinsic frame does not rely on such a system, but relies instead on intrinsic features of the environment of the object. For example, say that I left my phone in class one day. If someone asks me where I left it, I might say I left it on the desk at “the front” of the class. Such a description does not rely on cardinal directions, but it is clearly not relative to my own position or orientation with respect to the phone. That description will be interpretable for anyone familiar with university classrooms: the desk in this case is next to an LCD screen and next to the lectern, i.e. the “front” of the class. This reference is based on the intrinsic shape of the classroom, some culturally shared 3-D model with a “front”, “back”, and “sides”.

24 The three-fold categorization of orientation types is used as a basis for the discussion in this chapter, as it is in most recent work on the topic. It offers sufficient detail for a consideration of the work detailed here. It is worth noting, though, that orientation types can be categorized according to a related but more fine-grained six-fold categorization type. See O’Meara and Pérez Báez (2011:843) for a discussion of this classification.

For practical purposes, we can speak of a tripartite distinction between relative/egocentric, absolute/geocentric, and intrinsic frames of reference. It turns out that languages use these basic FoR’s to varying degrees. Speakers of some languages rely extensively on relative descriptions, for example, while other speakers may rarely if ever utilize this sort of description. For a detailed analysis of the way in which the grammars of numerous languages rely on divergent frames of reference, see Levinson and Wilkins (2006). For now let us consider two well-known cases in which speakers tend to rely on absolute FoR’s, Tzeltal and Guugu Yimithirr.
The Tzeltal of Tenejapa, who live in the Chiapas Highlands, use an absolute orientation system. This system is described in some detail in Brown and Levinson (1993). Crucially, the territory of these Tzeltal is characterized by a dramatic “uphill” slope, so that the (approximately) southern part of their territory has an altitude of about 1,700 meters (5,500 feet), while the (approximately) northern part of that land has an altitude of about 950 meters (3,000 feet). This altitude disparity results in pronounced effects on the environment, so that the uphill land is characterized by mountainous pine forests and the “downhill” land is more tropical. (Brown and Levinson [1993:49]) These diverse ecologies are exploited differentially in Tzeltal agriculture, and play a prominent role in the culture. This prominence is evident in the absolute frame of reference utilized in the language, since the location of objects is typically described with respect to the cardinal-like (but not quadrant-based) directions of being ta ajk’ol, ‘to uphill’, or ta alan, ‘to downhill’. For instance, consider clauses (4.3) and (4.4), taken from Brown and Levinson (1993:55).

What is so remarkable about such a system, from the perspective of speakers of a language such as English, is that Tzeltal speakers do not rely on relative descriptors even when depicting the location of a small set of objects on a flat plane immediately in front of them, and even when in enclosed spaces when topographical or celestial entities are not visible. In other words, even in the absence of a shift in the vertical dimension between the relevant objects, their location can be denoted via horizontal reference that relies inherently on a topographical vertical shift of a much larger scale. Brown and Levinson (1993)

present a series of anecdotes suggesting that the Tzeltal speakers in Tenejapa are constantly attuned to the locations of the “uphill” and “downhill” directions (as well as a “transverse” direction based on the other two). They note that in one case a Tzeltal-speaker agreed to be blindfolded, while being spun around in a darkened house. Even after being spun twenty times, he was able to point accurately to alan. Such a clear cognitive bias towards an absolute spatial orientation is plausibly engrained by the habitual linguistic reliance on the absolute FoR. As in the case of Korean children’s acquisition of topological notions, Tzeltal children seem to have acquired their orientation of “uphill” and “downhill” by around two years of age (Brown [2001:518]). They do not apparently pass through a stage in which they first exhibit relative spatial orientation, only to have that orientation reconfigured in an absolute manner. This developmental fact suggests strongly that their spatial orientation is shaped by exposure to language at a young age, rather than their familiarity with more general facets of adult Tzeltal culture, e.g. a vocational reliance on cardinal directions. Below we consider some recent experimental evidence offered in support of the claim that adult Tzeltal cognition is impacted by spatial language.
In the Australian language Guugu Yimithirr, “rarely a sentence will pass without some morphologically specific form of a cardinal direction root, and virtually all location is described in such terms” (Haviland [1996:285]). This pervasiveness of cardinal direction reference characterizes Guugu Yimithirr spoken clauses, but it is also evident in accompanying physical gestures. Unlike Tzeltal directional reference, in this language the cardinal directions referred to correspond to quandrants that could be characterized as northern, southern, eastern, and western.25 Speakers are constantly describing the location of referents with respect to these quadrants. Consider (4.5), a clause excised from naturalistic discourse, in which reference is made to the northern quadrant (gunggaarr).
(4.5) ngayu nhangu bagay, eh… yarra gunggaarr nhaawaa ‘I poked him (and said), “Hey… look yonder there to the North!”’ (Haviland [1996])
In this case, the speaker is recounting an experience in which he and another man swam some six kilometers through the ocean after being shipwrecked.

25 These quadrants are slightly askew, rotated slightly clockwise, of true north, south, east, and west. See Haviland (1998:5) for a precise description of the quadrants, which may be impacted by local environmental features such as the seasonal arc of the sun and the coastline near Guugu Yimithirr lands.

After arriving at the beach, he noticed a shark swimming in the waters to the north, and is describing to his interlocutor in (4.5) how he drew his shipwreck companion’s attention to the shark. As he does so verbally, he also does so gesturally, by pointing north simultaneously. What is particularly remarkable about this case is that the event he is recounting occurred some thirty years prior to the time of the utterance of (4.5). Clearly the speaker’s recollection of the spatial orientation of referents in the described event conforms to the absolute system found in his language, rather than a relative-type system.
Such cases provide strong ethnographic evidence that speakers of languages that utilize absolute FoR’s almost exclusively have a tendency to spatially orient their environment in an absolute fashion. Building upon work by Haviland (1993, 1996), Levinson (1996a, 1997) conducted a series of experimental tasks among the Guugu Yimithirr, in order to better elucidate the effects of their default linguistic FoR on their nonlinguistic cognition. His working hypothesis was that speakers of this language must take the information they acquire through spatial perception and code it with absolute directions in order to be able to later describe the spatial relationships of items in a perceived scene. That is, if their language requires them to denote absolute directions, then at the time of perception they must be particularly attuned to those directions.
One of the basic experimental tasks employed by Levinson to initially test this hypothesis involved stimulus cards with color chips of different sizes pasted on them. These cards were similar to those depicted in Figure 4.5. (Though the cards in Figure 4.5 have clear fills surrounding grayscale chips, rather than black fills surrounding color chips as in the originals.)

Figure 4.5: Grayscale reproductions of a pair of cards used as stimuli in Levinson (1997).
Subjects were presented with a pair of stimuli such as that in Figure 4.5, while facing north in a room, and were asked to select one of the cards. They then left the cards in place and were taken to a nearby room, identical in size, color, and furnishings. As they faced south in that second room, they were presented with a pair of stimulus cards identical to those witnessed in the first room.

84

Space

They were then asked to select which of the cards they had just chosen in the other room. Crucially, the answer to this sort of question varies in accordance with the FoR employed. Say one employs a relative FoR. If s/he chooses the stimulus card on the left in Figure 4.5 while facing north, then while facing south s/he will choose the card that is then on the left (but represented by the right alternative in Figure 4.5), since when facing the opposite direction that card will now have the black square to the left of the gray chip. (You get a similar effect if you turn this book upside down, since the card on the right in Figure 4.5 will then be on your left, and will resemble the other card as viewed from the initial perspective.) Now say one employs an absolute FoR while selecting the card on the left, while facing north in the room. In such a case the black square will be recalled as being to the west of the gray rectangle. Now if one is turned 180°, s/he might assume the black square should remain to the west (not the left) of the gray rectangle in the selected card in the second room. In short, an absolute FoR will result in differentiated card selection visà-vis a relative strategy. In Levinson (1997), this basic experimental task was undertaken with 12 Guugu Yimithirr speakers and 15 Dutch speakers. The Dutch speakers employed a relative strategy overwhelmingly, in 44/45 cases, consistent with their language’s reliance on relative spatial terminology. The Guugu Yimithirr speakers employed an absolute strategy overwhelmingly, in 27/34 cases. The cross-group disparity was significant at p=.0000 (Fisher’s exact test), in the direction predicted (Levinson 1997:114).
Another task employed in Levinson (1997), and subsequently by others, involved the use of a “maze” of arrows such as the one presented in Figure 4.6. Task participants were presented with a maze-like array of connected black arrows on a white sheet, describing a series of directions. They viewed the arrows while facing South in one room. They were then moved to a second room, in which they were facing North, and asked to select, from a series of cards, the pattern of arrows that depicted the completion of the arrow maze, i.e. that described how the arrows might return to their point of origin. Given the reversal of their orientation, the selection from the three options in Figure 4.6 revealed the FoR they relied on cognitively during the task. Option 1 represents an absolute/geocentric strategy, since it only accurately describes the completion of the maze if one is employing an absolute FoR. Option 3, on the other hand, represents a relative/egocentric strategy, since once one’s perspective is altered 180° that option will not describe the answer in absolute terms. As in the previous case, if you first look at Figure 4.6 rightside up, and next turn the page upside down, you might get a better sense of how the option selected reveals default FoR. Option 2 is a distractor option, utilized to ensure that the respondents comprehended the task. Selection of this option by any speakers would suggest task incomprehension.

Figure 4.6: Reproduction of a maze task. (Adapted from Levinson [1997:119])
While several maze types were used for this task, there was a clear difference across populations. The twelve Guugu Yimithirr speakers employed an absolute FoR in a majority of cases (24/36), and only one of them consistently employed a relative strategy. In contrast, fifteen Dutch speakers employed a relative FoR in the majority of the cases (42/45). This disparity was significant (p=0.0000, Chi-square). In only one case was a distractor option selected, demonstrating that task comprehension did not motivate the disparity between the groups of speakers. In short, the patterns of solutions selected by the participants were strongly consistent with the default FoR employed in their native languages. This suggests quite plausibly that the subjects’ native languages affected their performance on this nonlinguistic task, which presumably reflects their spatial orientation strategies more generally. Similar findings have been replicated with more elaborate maze tasks (and with speakers of other languages), for instance one in which participants watch a ball travel through a maze and then are asked to reproduce the path of the ball after being rotated 180°. (Levinson et al. [2002])
Recently I conducted the same basic arrows-maze task, with various stimuli such as that in Figure 4.6, with eight Karitiâna speakers. In most of the

86

Space

cases the Karitiâna selected options such as option 1 at the expense of those such as option 3. The disparity between their selection habits and those of the Dutch control group in Levinson (1997) were also significant (p=.0000, Fisher’s exact test). While there are words for ‘left’ (pon) and ‘right’ (he) in Karitiâna, speakers do not systematically employ a relative FoR when providing directions or describing spatial relationships. Crucially, though, Karitiâna speakers also do not typically employ absolute/geocentric reference. The default linguistic FoR is an “intrinsic” one. I mention these results because they naturally draw us to a potential confound with the experiment types described by Figure 4.6: depending on the characteristics of the physical setting in which the stimuli are represented, the selection of option 1 may reflect an absolute/geocentric-oriented response or an intrinsic-oriented response. For example, the front of the room may be in the same direction as South, so if a participant chooses the first option they may be construing the arrows as returning South, or returning to the front of the room. While the results for the arrow-maze task and the color chip task used in Levinson (1997) are consistent with a relativistic account, then, the tasks used are open to criticism in that they do not distinguish clearly between all three FoR’s. They are also susceptible to other criticisms. Perhaps the most obvious is that the stimuli employed in such tasks is much more familiar to individuals from western societies. For instance, twodimensional mazes are surely less familiar to Guugu Yimithirr and Karitiâna speakers than they are to most educated westerners. It may seem implausible that conflating variables such as differing education experience could result in consistent disparities along the neat linguistic lines of the sort observed. After all, the indigenous speakers tested did not evince task incomprehension, but exhibited instead a consistent strategy matching that typically employed in their language. Nevertheless, the methodologies evident in Levinson (1997) were further refined and expanded in subsequent works, e.g. Pederson et al. (1998) and Levinson (2003).
The studies described in Levinson (2003) were conducted among numerous populations, representing an assortment of languages. These included languages with basic FoR’s that were intrinsic, such as Mopan (Maya), relative/ egocentric, such as Japanese or Dutch, as well as absolute/geocentric, such as Tzeltal and Guugu Yimithirr. The work was also conducted among speakers of languages in which more than one FoR was frequently employed, for instance in Kilivala (Austronesian), in which all three FoR’s are commonly used. The crosslinguistic experimental work in question consisted primarily of five tasks, including two maze tasks, a “transitivity inference” task (see methodological discussion in Levinson [2003:163–165]), the task using color chips as in Figure 4.5, and an “animals in a row task”. The latter task has become particularly

87

influential, having been replicated and modified in more recent studies. Given its centrality to recent work on this topic, it is described next. It should be stressed though that all of these tasks are broadly similar and rely on the same methodological assumption: if speakers are presented with a set of stimuli and then rotated, their orientation to the stimuli in the rotated position will reveal whether the FoR they used to conceptually encode the stimuli matches the default FoR in their native language.
The most basic animals-in-a-row task is a simple performative task that does not merely require the participants to choose from a set of pre-selected options, as in the color chips task and the maze task described above. The task proceeds as follows: Subjects are presented with a transverse row of three toy animals, all of which are facing in the same direction. The toy animals are made of plastic, with an approximate width of 2.5 cm, a height of 3–4 cm, and a length of 5–7 cm. While only three toys are used for each trial in the case of the most basic version of the task, four toys are used during the course of the task: a pig, a horse, a cow, and a sheep. The toys in the stimulus array are located equidistant from each other. The task participant faces the three toy animals on a stimulus table, in the manner depicted in Figure 4.7. The subject is then rotated 180°, turning as s/he walks towards a second table located 4– 6 meters away. At the “recall” table they are asked to reconstruct the original sequence of toys in accordance with the orientation of the animals in the memorized array of toys. More specifically, the subjects are asked to “Make it again, just the same”. All instructions are carried out in the participant’s native language, though no spatial or deictic terms are used during the instructions.

As we see in Figure 4.7, the manner in which the subject reconstructs the array reflects their conceptualization of the original orientation, and an egocentric/relative conceptual encoding will result in a distinct reconstruction when contrasted with a geocentric/absolute coding. Note that this task also does not really distinguish between the utilization of intrinsic or absolute FoR’s, however. The task must be modified, in the manner discussed below, for the reliance on either of these FoR’s to be differentiated from reliance on the other.
The animals-in-a-row task has been conducted amongst a number of populations, in a variety of studies, with broadly consistent results of the sort predicted by a relativistic account. Speakers of languages that typically encode spatial information geocentrically tend to utilize the absolute/geocentric strategy for toy-array reconstruction, while speakers of languages that typically encode such information egocentrically more frequently employ the egocentric/relative strategy of array reconstruction. Levinson (2003:183–187) contrasts the results of the animals-in-a-row task obtained in numerous populations, among 85 speakers of languages with absolute coding strategies and 99 speakers of languages with relative coding strategies. The former group consists of speakers of Mparntwe Arrernte (Pama-Nyungan), Longgu (Austronesian), Belhare (Tibeto-Burman), Tamil (Dravidian), Hai||om (Khoisan), and Tzeltal (Maya). The latter is comprised primarily of Dutch, Japanese, and English speakers. Members of the latter group evinced egocentric/relative reconstruction of toy sequencing in a vast majority of cases, while those of the former utilized apparently absolute (though possibly intrinsic) reconstruction in an overwhelming majority of task trials. In fact, nearly 60% of the speakers of “relative FoR” languages utilized relative reconstruction in 100% of the trials, while only a small fraction systematically did not. Conversely, nearly 60% of the speakers of “absolute FoR” languages employed reconstruction consistent with an absolute FoR in 100% of the trials, while only a very small fraction consistently did not. The difference between groups’ reconstruction strategies was highly significant (Mann-Whitney U-test=1453, p<0.001), and clearly in the predicted direction. Similarly significant disparities were also observed for the other related tasks described in Levinson (2003).
Perhaps more interesting than these macro-level comparisons were the results of micro-level, pairwise contrasts between particular populations. For example, Mann-Whitney U-tests comparing the distribution of array-reconstruction strategies revealed significant disparities between the strategies of the speakers of Arrernte and Dutch (p<0.001); Arrernte and Japanese (p<0.05); Tzeltal and Dutch (p<0.001); Tzeltal and Japanese (p<0.001); Longgu and Dutch (p<0.001); and Longgu and Japanese (p<0.001). In fact, such differences were

Frames of reference

89

observed for any pairwise contrast between the results of a relative-FoR language’s speakers and those of an absolute-FoR language’s speakers. Furthermore, all pairwise contrasts between speakers with similar default linguistic FoR’s revealed no significant disparities in array reconstruction. So, for example, speakers of Arrernte and Tzeltal tended to reconstruct the arrays in a nonegocentric fashion, and there was no significant disparity in the performance of the two groups. Conversely, there was no significant difference between the rate at which the Dutch and Japanese-speaking subjects utilized relative-type conceptual encoding strategies. In short, where we might predict task-behavior differences based on linguistic factors, such dissimilarity did in fact surface. Where we might predict task-behavior similarity based on linguistic factors, such similarity did in fact surface. Such language/task-behavior correlations, considered in detail in Levinson (2003), are particularly noteworthy in the light of the many cultural and ecological factors at work. While members of population pairs such as the Arrernte and the Tzeltal or the Dutch and Japanese differ according to numerous cultural criteria, their performance on the animals task, as well as the other tasks in question, can be predicted in large measure by linguistic factors alone. While the correlation between a particular set of linguistic features and a particular nonverbal behavior is insufficient in and of itself to make definitive relativistic conclusions (see discussion in Chapter 1), the correlation observed here is most easily explained via a relativistic account since the correlation holds across numerous cultures. (Though it should be mentioned that the English, Dutch, and Japanese speakers tested are all embedded in industrialized/urban cultures, a point returned to below.)
In addition to being supported by the language/task-behavior correlation observed across a number of diverse cultures, relativistic conclusions may be buttressed by studies within groups that share many cultural features. After all, if two groups of people are best characterized as representing the same culture while differing according to some linguistic parameter, the groups in question offer a particularly useful test case for relativistic hypotheses. In the case of potential linguistic influences on spatial cognition, one such case is that of two groups of Tamil speakers. As discussed in Pederson (1993, 1995), there are two primary groups of Tamil speakers in Madurai, Tamilnadu. One of these is rural and speaks a geocentrically oriented variety of Tamil, while the other is primarily urban and speaks an egocentrically oriented variety. According to the results in Pederson’s studies, the orientation differences between the two groups of speakers, as ascertained from tasks such as the animals-in-a-row task, do pattern in the predicted direction. That is, those speakers of the geocentric variety tend to exhibit more geocentric patterns in their array reconstructions. It is important to stress, however, that the cross-

90

Space

group disparities in this case are not as significant as we might expect based on the rest of the literature so far surveyed. In fact, the disparities did not attain significance in the case of all tasks described by Pederson. The Tamil data are difficult to interpret, then, particularly in the light of the other factor involved, the urban vs. rural confound. While it is fair to say that the findings on Tamil are generally consonant with a relativistic position, they would hardly constitute convincing evidence, in and of themselves, to skeptics of such a position.
In a related fashion, findings among speakers of Australian English have demonstrated that speakers’ performance on rotation-based tasks can vary, even in the absence of systematic linguistic FoR variation. Research conducted by David Wilkins (reported in Levinson [2003]) demonstrated that English speakers residing near the central Australian town of Alice Springs evince dissimilar results on such tasks, when contrasted with English speakers in Sydney. Crucially, though, the central Australian speakers tested had extensive contact with a geocentric-FoR language, namely Arrernte. In short, the results on the nonverbal tasks for the central Australians fall somewhere in between the results obtained for the Sydney English speakers and the Arrernte speakers. Again, these results might be interpreted as being congruent with a relativistic interpretation, to the extent that they demonstrate yet another instance of cross-group variability in spatial cognition, and to the extent that the speakers of English who have had more exposure to geocentric Arrernte speech (and gestures) exhibit more geocentric behavior. Furthermore, the results seem to suggest that the disparities between Arrernte and Sydney English speakers are not simply due to broad cultural factors, and that exposure to geocentric communication may help to re-orient the default FoR’s of English speakers. In addition, the results appear to suggest that ecological factors (i.e. the difference between Sydney and the area around Alice Springs) are insufficient to account for the disparities in the task results between Arrernte speakers and Sydney English speakers. After all, even with extensive exposure to the Arrernte environment, English speakers do not completely adopt a geocentric conceptual coding. Nevertheless, it is also fair to say that these data are difficult to interpret, and could even be interpreted as being inconsistent with a strong relativistic position. After all, the data do suggest that there are spatial orientation disparities between central Australian English speakers and Sydney English speakers, though both groups technically speak a language with default egocentric FoR utilization.
In short, while the Tamil data and the Australian English data do not generally contravene a straightfoward relativistic position, they do not offer unilateral support for the position either. Perhaps they are most readily recon-

ciled with a more nuanced relativistic position, according to which spoken language and other factors such as gesture and nonlinguistic facets of culture play associated roles in the development of basic spatial orientation strategies. Such a position is also buttressed by other recently collected data, for instance recent findings obtained among Yucatec Mayas on the role of gestures in spatial orientation strategies (see discussion below). It is worth stressing here that most contemporary advocates of the relativistic position are proponents of such a nuanced position, and do not suggest that speech is the only sort of habitual behavior or symbolic representation type that impacts spatial cognition. For example, speakers of a given language may have different degrees of exposure to symbolic technologies such as maps. Some English speakers may rely heavily on such technologies at inordinate rates during recurring activities, e.g. flying a plane or hunting large game. Such exposure may result in lessened reliance on the egocentric FoR characterizing most English speakers. Assuming that is the case, this reduced reliance does not contravene a relativistic position, it merely highlights another sort of influence on spatial cognition.
The work discussed to this point, carried out primarily during the 1990’s and the early 2000’s, relied heavily on the 180°-rotation experimental paradigm exemplified in Figures 4.5–4.7. While this paradigm has proven extremely useful and easy to apply, it suffers from the aforementioned inability of 180° rotation tasks to distinguish between geocentric/absolute and object-centered/ intrinsic FoR strategies. For instance, in Figure 4.7 the possible configurations employed after rotation can clearly distinguish only the egocentric strategy from the allocentric strategies (both geocentric/absolute and object-centered/ intrinsic). After rotation a subject might place a given toy in a particular location because it was e.g. the northern-most toy in the original array, or because it was e.g. closest to the “back” of the room in the original array. In order to better distinguish between absolute and intrinsic reconfiguration strategies, and in order to systematically address other potential pitfalls (such as carrying out the rotations within one room), the rotation paradigm has been altered in some recent studies. Haun et al. (2011) adopt a number of methodological innovations in their study of Dutch and Hai||om speakers. For instance, rather than having the task participants rotate 180°, they had them rotate 90° (this innovation was first adopted in Levinson et al. [2002]). This rotation allowed the researchers to distinguish precisely which of the three potential FoR’s were employed by the subjects during the task. In addition, Haun et al. (2011) tested the two populations in remarkably similar outdoor settings, depicted in Figures 4.8 and 4.9. In order to eliminate the potential exacerbating effects of varying amounts of schooling, the authors relied on Dutch and Hai||om elementary school children 8–9 years of age. Hai||om is a language spoken in Namibia

with default geocentric FoR usage. While the researchers conducted four experiments, they all relied on the general rotation paradigm evident in Figure 4.8: While facing south outdoors and standing adjacent to their school building, students were presented with an array of toy animals on a table. They were then rotated 90° while moving to a second table on the other side of the building. Now facing west towards the school, they reconstructed the toy array per the instructions. Their reconstruction strategy then revealed whether they relied on an a) intrinsic/object-centered, b) geocentric/absolute, or c) egocentric/relative FoR during task completion.

Figure 4.8: Depiction of the modified animals-in-a-row task. Adapted from Haun et al. (2011).
In the case of the first experiment involving an initial array of three toys, all twelve Dutch-speaking children used an egocentric FoR in the majority of cases, while ten of twelve Hai||om speakers used a geocentric FoR. In the case of a second more complex task involving an array of six toys, all twelve Dutchspeaking children used an egocentric strategy, and all twelve Hai||om speakers utilized a geocentric strategy (though errors surfaced for both populations). In other words, increased tax complexity led to increased reliance on the FoR most typically instantiated in the participants’ native languages.
Some work (Li and Gleitman [2002], Li et al. [2011]) has suggested that cross-population differences in performance on the rotation-based experiments may simply reveal the preferences of speakers for task-completion only.
