Abstract This paper argues that the cognitive sciences need to incorporate aes- 17 thetic study of the arts into their methodologies to fully understand the nature of 18 human cognitive processes, because the arts re ect insights into human experience 19
that are unobtainable by the methodologies of the natural sciences. These insights 20
di er from those acquired by scienti c exploration, because they arise not from the 21
conceptual logic of reason but from the precategorial intuition of imagination. Aes- 22
thetics provides a methodology whereby we are able to understand how art enables 23 us to experience emotions caused by sense impressions. This methodology lies at 24 the heart of Giambattista Vico’s Principi di scienza nuova (1725–44), which attempts to 25 account for the way we live and participate in cultural, social, and civic communi- 26 ties. Vico’s theory challenges certain Western philosophical presuppositions that still inform much of cognitive science, such as the relation of language to our experience 27 of the natural world, the nature of subjective and objective representations, and the 28 role of the arts in the evolutionary development of the human mind. In basing my 29 approach to literature on Vico’s, Susanne K. Langer’s (1953, 1967), and Maurice 30 Merleau-Ponty’s (1962 [1945], 1968) theories, I argue that the language of litera- 31
ture is distinguished from conventional language use by its imaginative use of aes- 32
thetic patterns that make manifest the inherent character of the external world a we 33
experience it. By introducing the concepts of minding, metaphor, and icon as struc- 34
tures of the imagination, I show how the language of poetic expression in Matthew 35 Arnold’s poem “Dover Beach” enables us to apprehend the ways we intuitively par- 36

37 I am indebted to Mark J. Bruhn and Meir Sternberg for helping me clarify my arguments and sharpen my presentation in their comments and suggestions on earlier drafts of this 38

paper. This version is better, thanks to their editing.

8 . Introduction

9
10 Aesthetic inquiry and scienti c inquiry are two parallel and complementary 11 ways of knowing. The reality of the world that scientists and artists explore 12 is the same; the approach they take results in a di erent kind of knowledge: 13 the di erence between “to know” and “to be wise,” conoscere and sapere, con14 naître and savoir (Carr 1917: 193). Science encompasses knowledge of the 15 natural world through systems based on mathematics and logic; aesthet16 ics encompasses knowledge of human creativity, culture, and civilization 17 through systems based on expressions of sensory perceptions and values. 18 The two intersect at the point of the cognitive sciences, whose interdisci19 plinary elds explore the activities of the human mind and human behav20 ior. As cognitive scientists explore the workings of the human mind, they are 21 faced with the challenge of accounting for the functions of intuition, mem22 ory, emotion, sensory perception, and imagination in the way we think. Are 23 the methods of the natural sciences adequate to explaining them? 24 Over two hundred years ago, the Italian philosopher Giambattista Vico 25 thought not. In criticizing René Descartes’s (1909–14 [1637]) discourse 26 on scienti c method, Vico (1990 [1709]) argued for a new science (scienza 27 nuova), one with di erent theoretical bases and methodologies that would 28 lead to better understanding of human thought and behavior. Although 29 Vico focused primarily on explaining the historical course of human civili30 zations, the principles of his new science also apply to an understanding 31 of aesthetics as the science of sensory perception. Vico believed that poetic 32 wisdom (sapienza poetica) was the source of all knowledge, that it could be 33 found in the “imaginative universals” (universale fantastico) held in common 34 by the memory of people in all cultures and across centuries. Whereas

1. Vico published the rst edition of New Science in 1725. For the second edition in 1730, only three passages from the rst edition were retained, to be printed within the second New Sci-

37 ence. The third and nal edition, published in 1744 just before Vico’s death, is considered

38 Vico’s de nitive edition (Verene 2003: 157–63).

39 2. Vico uses the phrase “imaginative universals” in three places to describe Jove as a divine character “born naturally in poetry” (Vico 1948 [1744]: 107, §381), poetic fables which pre-
40 ceded “rational or philosophic universals” (ibid.: 138, §460), and the written hieroglyphic

41 characters “used by all nations in their beginnings” (ibid.: 307, §933).

Freeman • The Aesthetics of Human Experience 719

Descartes explores the reliability of the images that come to us through 1

sense experience, Vico asks how we come to have those images in the rst 2

place, how they are made present to the mind.

3

Human thought began, Vico believed, not with the development of 4 rational concepts but with that of memory and imagination. In making 5

this argument, Vico places aesthetics at the very beginning of human con- 6 ceptual development. The question for us then becomes, Can the two dif- 7

ferent methodologies of aesthetics and science be understood as comple- 8 mentary models that may be conjoined or interrelated to provide a fuller 9

understanding of human activity in all its forms, including the arts?

10

I believe they can. Increasingly, the ndings of the cognitive sciences 11

in such areas as psychology, linguistics, and studies of the human brain 12 concerning sensory perception and emotion complement Vico’s new sci- 13

ence and support the ndings of scholarly research into the various arts. 14 Knowledge of the arts, in both artistic creation and reception, provides 15

insight into the mind’s activities that involve human feeling. A great deal 16 of current research explores the relation of aesthetics and cognitive sci- 17

ence, and it is not my intention here to go into the di erent theoretical 18 approaches taken. Instead, I focus on aspects of aesthetics that challenge 19

certain presuppositions regarding the nature and role of poetry, such as its 20

21

3. “In that human indigence, the peoples, who were almost all body and almost no re ec- 22 tion, must have been all vivid sensation in perceiving particulars, strong imagination in apprehending and magnifying them, sharp wit in referring them to their imaginative genera 23

and robust memory in retaining them. It is true that these faculties appertain to the mind, 24

but they have their roots in the body and draw their strength from it” (ibid.: 280, §819).

25

4. The word aesthetics was coined by Alexander GottliebBaumgarten (2007 [1750]) to refer to the science of sensory perception, including the arts. Although Mark Turner (1996) has

26

persuasively argued for the role of imaginative storytelling in the origins of human thought, 27

the idea that poetry came later in human development and served merely as play behavior, 28

to provide a safe place in which to explore discomforting feelings, can still be found in recent 29 work in cognitive science, such as Boyd 2009. The notion of “play” in this respect is misleading. As James P. Carse (1986: 19) notes: “There is, however, a familiar form of playfulness 30

often associated with situations protected from consequence—where no matter what we do 31

(within certain limits), nothing will come of it. This is not so much playing as playing at, a 32

harmless disregard for social constraints.” To de ne art within the constraints of “playing at”

is to ignore its role in the in nite play of life.

33

5. Researchers in the cognitive sciences are increasingly turning toward aesthetics as an 34

important factor in understanding the workings of the human mind. Dustin Stokes’s (2009) 35

article “Aesthetics and Cognitive Science” surveys some of the issues involved and contains a preliminary bibliography of the burgeoning research in this area. Working from the per-

36

spective of cognitive poetics, Reuven Tsur (1992, 2008) shows in his analyses how aesthetic 37

e ects in poetry are supported by the ndings of cognitive psychology and neuroscienti c 38

research into brain structures.

39

1 place in the development of the human mind, the Western notions of sub2 jective and objective representation, and the relation of language to the 3 natural world. In realigning these issues into positions closer to a theory of 4 aesthetics that embraces sensory perception and emotion in poetry, I argue 5 that understanding the cognitive activities of minding, metaphor, and ico6 nicity can illuminate the nature of poetic expression and our experience of 7 it. In my analysis of Matthew Arnold’s poem “Dover Beach,” I apply Vico’s 8 arguments in his new science that relate to aesthetics by revising the way 9 we metaphorically construct “mind” as object and by understanding the 10 role of the imagination in creating meaning. This goes to show how poets 11 create an aesthetic language to break through the conventional uses of dis12 cursive language, which conceal our underlying, precategorial responses 13 to the world we experience. 14 Vico makes several important points for a science of aesthetics. These 15 are, in no particular order:

16

1. As “the rst humans” experienced and responded to repeated sensory

17

episodes, such as thunder, mental “places,” or topoi, were developed

18

that enabled memory of “sameness.”

19 2. Memory (Latin memoria) is equivalent to imagination, which enabled

20

“sameness” to be interiorized as mental image, which, being “named,”

21

gave rise to conceptualization of thought or reasoning.

22 3. Language began with inscribing physical signs (not with speech).

23

24 7. “The rst men, who spoke by signs, naturally believed that lightning bolts and thunder

25 claps were signs made to them by Jove; whence from nuo, to make a sign, came numen, the

26 divine will, by an idea more than sublime and worthy to express the divine majesty. They

27

believed that Jove commanded by signs, that such signs were real words, and that nature was the language of Jove” (Vico 1948 [1744]: 106, §379).

28 8. “The rst founders of humanity applied themselves to a sensory topics, by which they

29 brought together those properties or qualities or relations of individuals and species which

30 were so to speak concrete, and from these created their poetic genera. So that we may truly say that the rst age of the world occupied itself with the primary operation of the human
31 mind.” (ibid.: 149, §§495–96). Donald Phillip Verene (1981: 170) comments on this passage

32 as follows:

33

Vico’s notion of a “sensory topics,” a topica sensibile, is tied to his conception of sensibility as a

34

way of thinking—the notion that when sense takes the form of the imaginative universal in the

fantasia of the rst men, it is a kind of thought. A sensory topos, as Fisch points out in a remark

35

on this passage, is related to Aristotle’s conception of topics, or places, that could be kept in the

36

mind and serve for the inventing of possible arguments. (Fisch, Introduction, New Science, par.

37

K5, note) The fundamental di erence is that the sensory topos is achieved through feeling and not achieved as an element within discursive thought. (My emphasis)

38 9. 
39

40

But the di culty as to the manner of their origin [i.e., letters and writing] was created by the scholars themselves, all of whom regarded the origin of letters as a separate question from that

41

of the origin of languages, whereas the two were by nature conjoined. And they should have

Freeman • The Aesthetics of Human Experience 721

4. Philology, the historical meanings of words, in particular the explo- 1

ration of etymology, reveals that conceptualization of thought or rea- 2

soning arose originally from natural connections between physical 3

nature and bodily interaction with the environment.

4

5. Poetic thought arose from metaphorically attributing human senses 5

and passions to inanimate objects.

6

6. The poetic mind preceded abstract conceptualization and reasoning. 7

7. The natural sign systems of poetic forms created through memory 8

and imagination formed the basis from which more abstract concep- 9

tualization developed.

10

11 made out as much from the words for grammar and for characters. From the former, because grammar is de ned as the art of speaking, yet grammata are letters, so that grammar should 12

have been de ned as the art of writing. So, indeed, it was de ned by Aristotle, and so in fact 13

it originally was; for, as will here be shown, all nations began to speak by writing, since all were originally mute. The word character, on the other hand, means idea, form, model, and

14

certainly poetic characters came before those of articulate sounds. . . . But, giving up hope of 15

knowing how languages and letters began, scholars have failed to learn that the rst nations thought in poetic characters, spoke in fables, and wrote in hieroglyphics. These should have

16

been the principles, which must by their nature be most certain, of philosophy in its study of 17

human ideas and of philology in its study of human words. (Vico 1948 [1744]: 124–25, §429) 18

10. 

19

The philosophers and philologians should all have begun to treat of the origins of languages 20

and letters from the following principles, (1) That the rst men of the gentile world conceived 21 ideas of things by imaginative characters of animate and mute substances. (2) That they

expressed themselves by means of gestures or physical objects which had natural relations with 22

the ideas; for example, three ears of grain, or acting as if swinging a scythe three times, to sig- 23

nify three years. (3) That they thus expressed themselves by a language with natural signi ca-

tions.” (Ibid.: 125–26, §431)

24

11. 

25

26

That rst language, spoken by the theological poets, was not a language in accord with the nature of the things it dealt with (as must have been the sacred language invented by Adam, 27

to whom God granted divine onomathesia, the giving of names to things according to the 28

nature of each), but was a fantastic speech making use of physical substances endowed with life and most of them imagined to be divine . . . when we wish to give utterance to our under-

29

standing of spiritual things, we must seek aid from our imagination to explain them and, like 30

painters, form human images of them. But these theological poets, unable to make use of the understanding, did the opposite and more sublime thing: they attributed senses and passions,

31

as we saw not long since, to bodies, and to bodies as vast as sky, sea and earth. (Ibid.: 114–15, 32

§§401–2)

33

12. “All that has been so far said here upsets all the theories of the origin of poetry from 34

Plato and Aristotle down to Patrizzi, Scahger [sic] and Castelvetro. For it has been shown 35 that it was de ciency of human reasoning power that gave rise to poetry so sublime that the philosophies which came afterwards, the arts of poetry and of criticism, have produced none 36

equal or better, and have even prevented its production” (ibid.: 108, §384).

37

13. 

38

From all this it appears to have been demonstrated that, by a necessity of human nature, 39

poetic style arose before prose style; just as, by the same necessity, the fables, or imaginative universals, arose before the rational or philosophic universals which were formed through

40

the medium of prose speech. For after the poets had formed poetic speech by associating par- 41

722 Poetics Today :

1 Before human memory, there was only a ux of sensations and responses; 2 there existed no “place in the mind,” no topos which would contain the idea 3 of their repetition. Sensory topoi developed when the rst humans discov4 ered sameness in repetition. Thus, Vico says, when humans experienced 5 fear repetitively in responding to thunderstorms, a sensory topos created 6 a memory that enabled meaning to emerge by imaginatively creating an 7 identi cation rst between the emotion of fear and the sensation of thun8 der and then between the image of thunder and the name given to thunder, 9 Jove (see note 7). This imaginative identi cation is internal to the mind, 10 unlike the logical functions of induction and deduction, which are predi11 cated on objectifying perceptions of the external world. It re ects the more 12 basic, primordial, precategorial level of emotion and sensory memory of 13 Maurice Merleau-Ponty’s (1962 [1945]) phenomenology and the more 14 recent understanding of the cognitive unconscious (Damasio 2010). 15 Vico’s (1948 [1744]: 280, §819) theory accordingly explains the role of 16 memory, invention, and imagination in developing human thought: “Mem17 ory thus has three di erent aspects: memory [memoria] when it remembers 18 things, imagination [ fantasia] when it alters or imitates them and invention 19 [ingegno] when it gives them a new turn or puts them into proper arrange20 ment and relationship.” Memory, as the blend of memoria, fantasia, and 21 ingegno, is understood, then, as forming wisdom, “the faculty which com22 mands all the disciplines by which we acquire all the sciences and arts that 23 make up humanity” (ibid.: 98, §364). Whereas logic manipulates its terms 24 through the functions of induction and deduction, the imagination creates 25 them by metaphorically fusing sensory and emotional topoi into one:

26

The most luminous and therefore the most necessary and frequent [trope] is

27

metaphor. It is most praised when it gives sense and passion to insensate things,

28

in accordance with the metaphysics above discussed, by which the rst poets

29

attributed to bodies the being of animate substances, with capacities measured

30

by their own, namely sense and passion, and in this way made fables of them.

31

Thus every metaphor so formed is a fable in brief. (Ibid.: 116, §404; my emphasis)

32

33

ticular ideas, as we have fully shown, the peoples went on to form prose speech by contract-

34

ing into a single word, as into a genus, the parts which poetic speech had associated. Take for example the poetic phrase, ‘the blood boils in my heart,’ based on a property natural, eternal

35

and common to all mankind. They took the blood, the boiling and the heart, and made of

36

them a single word, as it were a genus, called in Greek stomachos, in Latin ira and in Italian col-

lera. Following the same pattern, hieroglyphics and heroic letters were reduced to a few vulgar

37

letters, as genera assimilating innumerable diverse articulate sounds; a feat requiring consum-

38

mate genius. By means of these vulgar genera, both of words and of letters, the minds of the

peoples grew quicker and developed powers of abstraction, and the way was thus prepared for

39

the coming of the philosophers who formed intelligible genera. What has here been discussed

40

is a small portion of the history of ideas. To such an extent has it been necessary, in seeking the

41

origins of letters, to deal in the same breath with those of languages!” (Ibid.: 139–39, §460)

Freeman • The Aesthetics of Human Experience 723

According to Vico, then, conceptual thought rst arose from metaphor— 1

not the conceptual metaphor of analogy but the sensory metaphor of attri- 2 bution or identity. Contemporary theories of metaphor (Lako and John- 3

son 1980; Fauconnier and Turner 2002) do not make this distinction, seeing 4 metaphor in general as analogically and conceptually based. Examples 5

of conceptual metaphors are

6

. By contrast, Vico says that when human beings rst developed 7

the metaphor “

” they were not nding similarity or com- 8

paring Jove with thunder but were attributing existential, sensory iden- 9

tity between thunder and Jove. This distinction between analogical and 10 attributive reasoning lies, I believe, at the heart of the di erence between 11

science and aesthetics. Aesthetics provides a methodology whereby we are 12 able to understand how art enables us to experience emotions caused by 13

sense impressions and thus uncover insights into the primary workings of 14

the human mind.

15

As Vico’s new science indicates, the methodologies of the natural sci- 16 ences and of aesthetics are not the same. In commenting on biologists who 17

attempt to apply scienti c principles to the exploration of art, Susanne K. 18

Langer (1967: 243–44) notes:

19

20
Their purpose is to penetrate the mysteries of art with the help of their biological knowledge; mine is to gain some biological and psychological insights 21 through the suggestiveness of artistic forms. A symbol always presents its import 22 in simpli ed form, which is exactly what makes that import accessible for us. 23

No matter how complex, profound and fecund a work of art—or even the whole 24

realm of art—may be, it is incomparably simpler than life. So the theory of art 25

is really a prolegomena to the much greater undertaking of constructing a con- 26

cept of mind adequate to the living actuality.

27

In calling for “a concept of mind adequate to the living actuality,” Langer 28

suggests, like Vico, that one cannot fully understand the workings of the 29

human mind without taking into consideration the structures of aesthetic 30

experience. Understanding these structures, however, as they apply to lit- 31

erary creativity depends on two radically di erent notions of how human 32

language relates to the natural world: either nature is totally indepen- 33

dent of language or language makes nature manifest. In the next section 34

therefore, I elaborate on this di erence to introduce my theory of poetic 35

iconicity.

to distinguish conceptual 39

from linguistic metaphor. For example, the linguistic metaphor “we have reached a cross- 40

road in our relationship” is based on the conceptual metaphor

724 Poetics Today :

1 . Language, Nature, and Mind

2 Vico’s theory of the origins and development of language as arising from

3 natural connections between physical nature and bodily interaction with

4 the environment stands in sharp contrast to traditional Western views that

5 focus on the arbitrary nature of language. As Stephen Owen (1985: 79), the

6 classical Chinese scholar, has noted: “There is language; there is some-

7 thing that precedes and transcends language; between language and that

8 ‘something,’ two relations are possible, and the distinction between them

9 corresponds to a fundamental division in human concepts of nature. Either

10 nature is independent of language, and language only blocks and distorts

11 our knowledge of it; or the form and distinctions of language derive from

12 nature and grant us the most perfect access to it.”

13

Attributing the idea that there is a “truth beyond language” (and there-

14 fore inaccessible by it) to Western philosophy, Owen (ibid.: 21) claims that

15 “Western theories of literature are the children of the Platonic critique,

16 and though they rebel and marry into less tainted lines, they cannot escape

17 their ancestry.” Chinese classical poetics, to the contrary, seeing human

18 beings as an integral part of the natural world, considers the “aesthetic

19 pattern” (wen) of literary language as “the nal stage in a process of mani-

20 festation; and the writer, instead of re-presenting the outer world, is in fact

21 only the medium for this last phase of the world’s coming-to-be” (ibid.:

22 20). What literary language makes manifest, according to Chinese poetic

23 theory, is “direct presentation of the physical world” and “authentic pre-

24 sentations of historical experience” (ibid.: 57).

25

Rather than adopting the “either/or” perspective suggested by Owen’s

26 comparison of Western and Chinese thought, I suggest that it is not lan-

27 guage per se that blocks or enables our experience of nature but the way

28 language is used. Blocking and enabling refer to Leonard Talmy’s theory of

29 force dynamics as an explanation of causation. According to Talmy (2000:

30 10), force dynamics describes what happens when the energy or force of

31 one object or entity blocks or allows the energy or force of another to

32 occur. For example, a dam causes the buildup of water in a reservoir by

33 blocking its normal ow; a steep hillside accelerates the ow of a moun-

34 tain stream by causing the water to fall rapidly. In like manner, the devel-

35 opment of abstract thought by naming or reifying sensory feelings and

36 events allowed a rapid acceleration of conceptual reasoning but at the cost

37 of blocking or concealing its origins (see note 13). Following Vico’s under-

38 standing of the emergence of conceptual thought and Talmy’s theory, I

39 argue that the conceptual rei cation that marks discursive language serves

40 to block the underlying, preconscious experiences of the working mind.

Freeman • The Aesthetics of Human Experience 725

The term mind is itself an example. Having rei ed the cognitive activities 1

of the brain through nominalization, we tend to assume the existence of 2 mind as an entity, which can then be conceived metaphorically as a con- 3

tainer: we can bring things to mind, we can keep things in our minds, and 4 so on. In fact, it is hard not to speak in this way. It is much more e cient 5

and economical to speak of “mind” as though it were an entity than it is 6 to characterize the actual cognitive events that the word refers to. It is pre- 7

cisely this ability to conceptualize and to abstract from the experience of 8 sensory and emotional expression that led, as Vico argues, to the devel- 9

opment of human thought. But in reifying the mind, we are blocking or 10 concealing those underlying forces. Literary language, to the contrary, as 11

Reuven Tsur (1992: 360–61; 2008: 577, 585) has shown, serves to slow down 12 such cognitive economy by delaying conceptual categorization. Delaying 13

conceptual categorization enables us to draw closer to the phenomeno- 14 logical world of immediate, preconceptual experience. In other words, the 15

aesthetic pattern (wen) of literary language allows access to the precate- 16 gorial activities of the mind that Vico describes as attributing senses and 17

passions to the external world and thus makes manifest the “coming to be” 18 of the experienced world. To capture this aspect of our cognitive capaci- 19

ties, I propose the term minding for the cognitive workings of the mind that 20 include the sensory and emotional as well as the rational, a mindfulness 21

that is aware of our surroundings, attentive to and caring about the way we 22 experience and conceptualize our world through our sensory perceptions 23

and emotions (Freeman 2009). Using language aesthetically makes mani- 24 fest the inherent character of the experienced world and our response to it. 25

When poetic language succeeds in making the “coming to be” of the world 26 manifest and evoking an emotional response to it, then, I claim, poetic ico- 27

nicity is achieved, as I describe in the following section.

28

30
. The Ontology of Poetic Perception as Iconic of Reality
31

Although poets in the Western tradition cannot, in Owen’s (1985: 21) words 32 quoted in the previous section, “escape their ancestry,” they nevertheless 33

have an intuitive understanding of wen, of language as aesthetic pattern, 34 that reveals the intrinsic, natural relationship of words to our experience 35

1 their Dinglichkeit” (Ransom 1938:112–13), of “the object as it really is” (Eliot 2 1964: 82–83). Anthony Hecht (1995: 130) speaks of poetry as capturing “the 3 rich complexity of actuality—the unsimpli ed plenitude of the objective 4 world.” These writers suggest that art has the capacity to conjure up the 5 feelings of experiencing the concrete, precategorial world as it is before the 6 mind conceptualizes it. Joseph Conrad (1947: 705–8), in his preface to The 7 Nigger of the Narcissus, expresses succinctly this notion of poetic art:

8

A work that aspires, however humbly, to the condition of art should carry its jus-

9

ti cation in every line. And art itself may be de ned as a single-minded attempt

10

to render the highest kind of justice to the visible universe, by bringing to light

11

the truth, manifold and one, underlying its every aspect. It is an attempt to nd

12

in its forms, in its colors, in its light, in its shadows, in the aspects of matter and

13

in the facts of life, what of each is fundamental, what is enduring and essen-

14

tial—their one illuminating and convincing quality—the very truth of their

15

existence. . . . My task which I am trying to achieve is, by the power of the writ-

16

ten word, to make you hear, to make you feel—it is, before all, to make you see.

17

That—and no more, and it is everything.

18 Conrad’s task is what Victor Shklovsky (1965: 12) calls making “the stone 19 stony.” As Aristotle (1995) rst argued in chapter 9 of the Poetics, whereas 20 discursive language abstracts from the particularities of detail to capture 21 what they have in common, aesthetic language does the opposite: it cap22 tures the essence of the particular individuality of experienced reality.
23

24 . . Intuitions and Concepts

25 By focusing on the particularities of experience, artists attempt to cap-

26 ture what Benedetto Croce calls intuitions. Intuition is a necessary a priori

27 component in the development of concepts. As Croce notes:

28

29

What is knowledge by concepts? It is knowledge of the relations of things and

30

the things are intuitions. Without intuitions concepts are not possible. Just as

31

without the matter of impressions intuition itself is not possible. This river, this

32 16. In philosophy, the term a priori does not indicate temporal precedence but rather refers

33 to a proposition that “can be known independent of any experience other than the experi-

34 ence of learning the language in which the proposition is expressed, whereas a proposi-

35

tion that is knowable a posteriori is known on the basis of experience” ( Jason S. Baehr, “A Priori and A Posteriori,” Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, www.iep.utm.edu/apriori/#H3

36 [2006]). However, as Baehr notes, the de nition is controversial, since it is a question of

37 how to de ne the “experience” on which the distinction is grounded. My use of “necessary

38 a priori” attempts to capture the independent status of the aesthetic: “If we have shown that the æsthetic form is altogether independent of the intellectual and su ces to itself without
39 external support, we have not said that the intellectual can stand without the æsthetic. To

40 describe the independence as reciprocal would not be true” (Croce 1953 [1902]: 22).

lake, this brook, this glass of water, this rain, are intuitions, the concept is water, 1

not this or that appearance or particular instance, but water in general, in what- 2

ever circumstances of place or time it is realized, the matter of in nite intu- 3

itions, but of one constant concept only. (Quoted in Carr 1917: 81)

4

Croce’s use of the term intuition seems functionally related to the way 5

“image” is di erentiated from “concept” in cognitive linguistics. Although 6

image schemata are, unlike intuitions, generalized forms, by providing, 7

in Mark Johnson’s (1987: 168) words, “relations in a shared basis of mean- 8

ing,” they “make concepts and propositions possible.” A sensory impres- 9

sion is preconscious, becoming an image in the mind when the experiencer 10

becomes aware of it and a concept when it becomes generalized through 11

abstraction. The repeated word this in Croce’s list of intuitions draws atten- 12

tion to the fact that he is referring to particular physical entities. The words 13

river, lake, brook, and so forth are concepts in the sense that they are gener- 14

alized from the speci c thing you might actually be looking at or plung- 15

ing into. (Proper names help distinguish this di erence—Leaping River in 16

China, for example, or Lake Geneva in Switzerland.) But I suggest they 17

are not yet concepts in the sense that “water” is a concept, which is even 18

more of a generalization/abstraction. At the furthest extreme of scienti c 19

abstraction, water is represented, both notationally and analytically, as 20

H O. Through science, we know the constitution of water; through aes- 21

thetics, we know what it means to experience it. When we see a lake, we 22

both experience it as an intuition in Croce’s sense and recognize it as a 23

concept, a body of water. In this way, both the experiential fact of an image 24

and its conceptual value are compressed in its representation.

25

Since intuitions are always of sensations and impressions, Croce (1953 26

[1902]: 10) identi es artists not by a special kind of intuitive faculty but by 27

the fact that they are able to capture the qualities of sensation and impres- 28

sion: “The painter is a painter, because he sees what others only feel or 29

catch a glimpse of, but do not see. We think we see a smile, but in reality 30

we have only a vague impression of it, we do not perceive all the charac- 31

teristic traits of which it is the sum, as the painter discovers them after he 32

has worked upon them and is thus able to x them on the canvas.” Croce’s 33

description suggests that it is the activity of making ( poesis) that leads to the 34

discovery of the nature of reality. Knowing through making is in this sense 35

an aesthetic, not scienti c, activity.

governing principle for conceptual integration.

728 Poetics Today :

1 . . Aesthetic Iconicity

2 Vico places the human knowledge that occurs through Croce’s “making” 3 within the “modi cations of the human mind” and so anticipates the study

4 of aesthetics as the science of human cognitive activity. The arts hold a 5 special place in this general notion of aesthetics because they attempt to

6 capture human sensory experience of the external world. By focusing on 7 the concrete forms or qualia of “the visible universe,” the arts capture lived

8 experience through the fusion of concepts with the sensations and emo9 tions that constitute feeling. When they are successful in doing so, they cre-

10 ate what I call an “icon” of reality (Freeman 2007). “Aesthetic iconicity” is 11 my term for this characteristic of all successful art forms, “poetic iconicity”

12 my term for the literary arts. 13 The theory of aesthetic iconicity draws from two di erent ways of

14 understanding the term icon. In its scienti c, Peircean semiotic sense of 15 icon, all direct representations of ideas may be said to be iconic. In popu-

16 lar usage, the term iconic refers to anything—from photographs of war 17 to New York taxicabs—that triggers a particular resonance in the mind

18 in response to some experienced reality. That is, some thing or some

19 20 18. Vico (1948 [1744]: 109, §331) notes:

21

But in the night of thick darkness enveloping the earliest antiquity, so remote from ourselves,

there shines the eternal and never-failing light of a truth beyond all question: that the world of

22

civil society has certainly been made by men, and that its principles are therefore to be found

23

within the modi cations of our own human mind. Whoever re ects on this cannot but marvel

24

that the philosophers should have bent all their energies to the study of the world of nature, which, since God made it, He alone knows; and that they should have neglected the study of

25

the world of nations or civil world, which, since men had made it, men could hope to know.

26 19. For Charles Sanders Peirce, an iconic representation (hypoicon) can take the form of

27 image, diagram, or metaphor. He writes: “Hypoicons may be roughly divided according to

28 the mode of Firstness of which they partake. Those which partake of simple qualities, or First Firstnesses, are images; those which represent the relations, mainly dyadic, or so regarded,
29 of the parts of one thing by analogous relations in their own parts, are diagrams; those which

30 represent the representative character of a representamen by representing a parallelism in

31 something else, are metaphors” (Peirce 1955: 105, Collected Papers 2.274–302). Since he believes that “the only way of directly communicating an idea is by means of an icon,” then a dia-
32 gram is a representation “even although there be no sensuous resemblance between it and its

33 object, but only an analogy between the relations of the parts of each” (ibid.).

34 20. Mayor Michael Bloomberg was quoted in the press as saying that the taxicab was

35

a New York icon. Examples of usage are too numerous to quote. Anything can become iconic, as the following quotation about E. M. Forster shows: “Forster’s timid sexual exploits

36 seem inconsequential rather than iconic” (New Yorker 2010: 137). Over the past decade, the

37 terms icon and iconic have become extremely fashionable in everyday discourse. Hardly a

38 day passes but I come across such usage in newspaper and magazine articles. Examination of the British National Corpus and other databases would document the rise and usage
39 of such expressions. Although I was not able to access these sources for this essay, I did

40 consult a new corpus developed by Jean-Baptiste Michel et al. (2011), who describe their

41 project as follows: “We constructed a corpus of digitized texts containing about 4% of all

event becomes iconic when it takes on symbolic signi cance for a person, 20 a group, a nation, or a culture. In this sense, iconicity indicates the special 21 status an object, image, person, or event has acquired in potentially achiev- 22 ing universal signi cance, becoming an archetype in the collective mem- 23 ory of humankind. From semiotics, aesthetic iconicity takes the isomorphic 24 qualities of the sign; from popular usage, it takes the motivating impulses 25 of signi cance (Freeman 2007). However, poetic iconicity is not simply 26 something semiotically inherent within a literary text, nor does it re ect 27 simply the signi cance attached to things or events. Poetic iconicity is the 28 means whereby the poet manipulates the semiotic iconic features inherent 29 in language to capture the essence of an experience. Iconicity in this sense 30 di ers from its semiotic meaning in being not the direct representation of 31 an idea but the semblance of an ontological reality. Iconicity provides a 32 means for expressing the world of the senses before the conceptualizing 33 mind moves us toward abstraction. It is, in Merleau-Ponty’s (1962 [1945]) 34

n characters) I ran through Google Books Ngram Viewer for the terms icon and iconic re ects 38 increased usage up to the year 2000, not including references in magazines and newspapers. In the past decade, there has been an exponential increase in such usage. Although the 39

n-gram corpus cannot reveal the meanings ascribed to the terms, my informal record shows 40

overwhelmingly that the terms are being used in their popular, not semiotic, sense.

730 Poetics Today :

1 terms, our primordial experience of precategorial being that underlies the 2 structure of reality. This reality is usually “in-visible” to us, not as absence 3 or void but as being hidden in the visible but always present in the moment 4 (Merleau-Ponty 1968). Like meaning, poetic iconicity is a dynamic process 5 the reader constructs that is triggered by the writer’s intentions as revealed 6 through forms “expressive of human feeling” (Langer 1953: 51). In my de 7 nition, then, aesthetic iconicity is related to Vico’s imaginative universals. 8 For example, the sherman that frequently appears in classical Chinese art 9 and poetry (especially Tang poems and Ci poems of the Song dynasty) is 10 the actual, particular gure in the poem or painting, but at the same time 11 it represents in Chinese cultural tradition the artist or the artist’s ideal 12 of being secluded from the imperial court. In this sense the image of the 13 sherman is archetypal. But in each individual artist’s poem, according to 14 Tan Yingwen (personal communication), “it may carry some unique char15 acteristics like harboring his [the poet’s] lofty belief as the one in Liu Zong16 yuan’s River Snow or mentality of leisure and comfort as in Zhang Zhihe’s 17 Fishing Song.” In poetry, words are made to work not discursively, to create 18 meaning, but aesthetically, to capture the precategorial essence of experi19 ence that makes a poem an icon of felt reality. 20 The distinction between discursive and aesthetic language is exempli21 ed in the contrast between two recent translations (see Bowersock 2009) 22 of an epigram by Marcus Valerius Martialis (Martial):

23

Dum Phaethontea formica vagatur in umbra,

24

Inplicuit tenuem sucina gutta feram.

25

Sic modo quae fuerat vita contempta manente,

26

Funeribus facta est nunc pretiosa suis.

27

(Martialis 1823: 434–35)

28
29 The word epigram comes from the Greek ἐπίγραμμα (epigramma), inscrip30 tion, and from ἐπιγράφειν (epigraphein), meaning to write on or inscribe. This 31 re ects Vico’s observation that language may have arisen from the physical 32 form of written characters. Martialis’s epigram refers to a natural occur33 rence whereby tree resin is fossilized into the precious stone amber. In its 34 liquid state, when amber exudes from the tree, it sometimes encases small 35 insects or owers before it hardens. This hardening process takes millions 36 of years, so that in its own fossilizing it fossilizes whatever is caught in it,

37 21. I am grateful to Tan Yingwen for clarifying the iconic representation of the sherman in 38 Chinese poetry. Tan (personal communication) notes that the poet- sherman imagines “that 39 he can retire from the imperial court, and so distance himself from the annoying competi-
tion or ght against others for wealth, power or reputation, which is called guī yˇın (归隐). 40 This ideal is in striking contrast with chū shì (出仕), scholar-bureaucrats’ mainstream ideal, 41 that is, being recruited as a government o cial.”

which is itself therefore millions of years old. According to one mineraloid 1

website, “The odd inclusions that are often seen in amber usually add to 2

amber’s unique look and in many cases greatly increase its value” (Ame- 3

thyst Galleries 1995–2011). In Martialis’s epigram therefore, the story it 4

tells blends the fate of the ant encased (inscribed) in amber with the moral 5

that death can make precious what life despised.

6

D. R. Shackleton Bailey (Martialis 1993) translates the epigram almost 7

word for word into discursive prose: “As an ant was wandering in Phae- 8

thonic shade, a drop of amber enfolded the tiny creature. So she that was 9

despised but lately while life remained has now been made precious by her 10

death” (quoted in Bowersock 2009: 37).

11

A more recent translation by Garry Wills (Martialis 2008) has a pithier, 12

more poetic quality:

13

14

A drop of amber hit an ant,

While crawling past a tree,

15

A brief and tri ing thing preserved

16

For all eternity.

17

(Quoted in Bowersock 2009: 37)

18

19
Both translations preserve the two-part structure of Martialis’s original epi- 20 gram. First we are given a description of the event, then we are invited to 21 consider its signi cance. Shackleton Bailey’s translation directly captures 22 Martialis’s conceptual alteration of attitude toward the ant from being 23 despised in life to being made precious in death. It does not attempt to 24 replicate the aesthetic e ects of the original prosody. In Latin, the “inscrib- 25 ing” of the ant is rendered in a ponderous metrical form with many polysyl- 26 labic words, a form that humorously throws into relief the insigni cance of 27 its subject. Although Shackleton Bailey’s prose translation uses Latinate- 28 derived words, it does not capture the feeling that Martialis’s original 29 poetic form communicates. Wills’s translation transforms the original 30 into a poetic form that is quite di erent from the original Latin but takes 31 advantage of the aesthetic possibilities of English. The meter he chose is 32 based on ballad meter, which has the virtue of being ancient and memo- 33 rable. Instead of the ponderous written quality of the original epigram, 34 Wills’s translation depends for its aesthetic e ects on its oral quality, with 35 its short monosyllables and the predominance of the explosive-sounding 36 /t/ consonant. These sound e ects occur in the transitive verb hit, so that 37 we feel more directly the impact of fate on the ambered ant, just as we feel 38 the impact of the apple that dropped on Isaac Newton. The progressive 39 use of “crawling” gives us a sense of the event as it is happening. (If the sec- 40 ond line is altered to read “While past a tree it crawled,” one can feel the 41

732 Poetics Today :

1 di erence.) The su xes of the two-syllable words, amber, crawling, tri ing,

2 carry the weakest possible stress and thus throw into greater contrast the

3 word presérve with its major stress on the second syllable. “Preserve” is also

4 a more indirect choice than Shackleton Bailey’s “made precious,” so that

5 we are drawn into active interpretation, since we have to make the addi-

6 tional connection that we only preserve that which we value. The term pre-

7 serve also carries with it the notion of conservation, the idea of the ant fos-

8 silized. The poem climaxes on the last word, etérnity, with its stressed vowel

9 echoing that of preserve, and its four syllables, the longest word in the poem,

10 mirroring the length of eternity.

11 These suprasegmental e ects of syllables and sounds in Wills’s transla-

12 tion complement the way the words are working. The preserving of the ant

13 in amber re ects the nature of the epigram itself as inscription. The physi-

14 cality of burial is captured in Wills’s choice of the word preserved, re ect-

15 ing Martial’s funeribus more speci cally than had Martial chosen mortibus,

16 Shackleton Bailey’s “death.” It is not the death but the burial of the ant that

17 has occasioned the epigram. Note that the scope of the appositional phrase

18 “a brief and tri ing thing” is conceptually ambiguous. On one level, the

19 phrase obviously refers to the ant, a lowly, inconspicuous insect with a brief

20 life span. But it can also refer to the event, that is, the entire preceding two

21 lines. Not only is the ambered ant preserved for all eternity, but its story

22 is too. In other words, the ambered ant contains within its fossilized pres-

23 ervation the history of the event, and the forensic geologist who discovers

24 the fossil may “read” its inscribed story accordingly, just as we do in read-

25 ing the poem. Shackleton Bailey (and perhaps Martial too) is reporting an

26 event as it actually happened. Wills is making the language of his poem

27 enact it. The drop falls, the ant is ambered, and the story is preserved. As

28 we read, the poem dramatizes for us its happening in an eternal present.

29 This moment of being in the eternal present for both ant and poem

30 marks the archetypal occurrence of poetic iconicity. Wills’s “for all eternity”

31 reinforces this aesthetic meaning. The word eternal has two meanings. For

32 the sciences, all necessary propositions are eternal in the sense that they are

33 independent of time—they are unchanging, true for all time, as opposed to

34 existential (contingent) propositions. For aesthetics, as Croce notes:

35

The present is eternal in quite another meaning. It exists and it comprehends

36

existence. The temporal present is a present which succeeds a past and exists by

37

virtue of the non-existence of the past. The eternal present is the present outside

38

which no existence falls. The distinction of past from present is not the distinc-

39

tion of did exist from does exist. The past exists in the present, and the temporal

40

distinctions then and now, before and after, are determinations within existence.

41

It is only the abstractions of the mathematical and natural sciences which have

Tseng Proof • 2011.11.18 15:35

8989 Poetics Today • 32:4 • Sheet 116 of 151

Freeman • The Aesthetics of Human Experience 733

made this doctrine sound contrary to reason. When we re ect on our mind, our 1

life, our self, our individuality, we perceive that what we apprehend as real exis- 2

tence is our past acting in the present. This past is carried along in the present, 3

and cut o from it the present is not the present. Everything which partakes of 4

the nature of life and mind involves the fact that it is process or activity, the exis- 5

tence of the past in the present. This is the very notion of duration. The eter- 6 nal present means, therefore, that reality is one duration which includes past, present, and future, as distinct from an abstract present which excludes from 7

itself an abstract past and an abstract future. (Quoted in Carr 1917: 203)

8

9

As readers, experiencing the feeling of being in the moment of a poem’s 10

eternal present is to experience the poem’s iconicity. That is to say, poetic 11

iconicity occurs when we experience what Langer (1953: 40) has described 12

as the nature of all art, the semblance of felt life through “forms symbolic 13

of human feeling.” It is not always easy to describe one’s feelings when such 14

iconic enactments occur. Here we may feel a positive sense of completion, 15

a sense of ful llment of the ant’s otherwise lowly destiny, a sense of amuse- 16

ment, the comforting recognition that eternity too can belong to the most 17

inconspicuous of creatures, or indeed all or none of the above. However 18

one might describe them, the feelings we experience reading Wills’s ver- 19

sion are more intensi ed compared with Shackleton Bailey’s.

20

21

. . Blending and Metaphor in Aesthetic Iconicity

22

An aesthetic icon can thus be understood in terms of an emergent struc- 23

ture from the blending of concept, sense, and emotion. As Samuel Tay- 24

lor Coleridge (1817: chap. 14) notes in speaking of the “images, thoughts, 25

and emotions” of the mind’s faculties, the poet “di uses a tone and spirit 26

of unity, that blends, and (as it were) fuses, each to each, by that synthetic 27

and magical power, to which we have exclusively appropriated the name 28

of imagination.” The fusion or blending of sensory impressions and the 29

forms of feeling to create the emergent structure of an icon is enabled by 30

metaphor, de ned as domain crossing (Freeman 2009, 2011). Historically 31

associated with poetry, metaphor is traditionally understood as convey- 32

ing ideas that are palpably false because they are drawn from di erent 33

domains. Time is not literally “swift-footed” (Shakespeare 1954: 1108, Son- 34

net 19), nor does winter literally have a “ragged hand” (Shakespeare1954: 35

1106, Sonnet 6).The question is whether this is an example of John Ruskin’s 36

(1856) pathetic fallacy, which falsely projects human emotions or contem- 37

plative fancy onto the things of the natural world. Yet poets and writers 38

39 22. Croce’s idea of reality as duration that subsumes past, present, and future is consistent with Merleau-Ponty’s (1962 [1945]: 415) phenomenology of time, “not as an object of our 40

knowledge, but as a dimension of our being.” See discussion in Freeman 2004.

734 Poetics Today :
1 claim that they show things as they “really are.” How can false impressions 2 give a true sense of reality? 3 Cognitive scientists have shown us a di erent way of understanding 4 metaphor. Metaphor is no longer seen as a false equation of elements from 5 di erent domains but as the very process by which we are able to access 6 and understand the relation between domains. It is therefore not a trope 7 restricted to poetic expression but an integral part of our cognitive pro8 cesses. George Lako and Mark Johnson’s (1980) conceptual metaphor 9 theory and Gilles Fauconnier and Mark Turner’s (2002) conceptual inte10 gration network theory, known as “blending,” de ne metaphor not as the 11 result of false imagination but as a process by which we make sense of our 12 experience of the world as re ecting the way we think. In cognitive lin13 guistic theory, a domain is a conceptual entity consisting of a coherent 14 knowledge structure (Evans 2007: 61–62). Domains in this sense are either 15 experiential, derived from embodied experience, both sensory and sub16 jective, or conceptual, more complex and not directly derived from experi17 ence. According to conceptual metaphor theory, we understand abstract 18 concepts like love and justice in terms of journeys and scales based on 19 concrete image schemata of paths and balances. In conceptual integration 20 network theory, we create new meaning from fusing or blending shared 21 topology from di erent domains, whether they are abstract or concrete. 22 Both conceptual metaphor theory and conceptual integration net23 work theory,as their names suggest, operate at the level of thought that 24 Vico describes as emerging with the development of the human mind. 25 At the sensory level, Vico reminds us, the opposite occurs: there it is our 26 senses and passions that are imposed on the inanimate objects of the natu27 ral world (see note 11). More recent cognitive research has taken up the 28 challenge of understanding how sensory impressions and emotions inter29 relate with conceptualization within the cognitive mind. This challenge 30 has led to a consideration of the role of aesthetics in the creation of mean31 ing with respect to both sensory perceptions of the natural world and artis32 tic expression (Hogan 2003; Modell 2003; Turner 2006; Holland 2009). 33 The human capacity to synthesize through fusion or blending enables 34 the poet to create through language a semblance or icon of reality for the 35 reader, not the reality that arises from our discursive representations of 36 the world (Shackleton Bailey’s descriptive narration) but the reality of our 37 being part of Merleau-Ponty’s (1968) “in-visible” world, the immediate, 38 always eeting present that forever escapes our objectivizing gaze (Wills’s 39 moment of the drop falling). This feeling of being drawn in to the eternal 40 present of the poem comes from the cognitive activities of “minding,” both 41 the poet’s and the reader’s.

The cognitive reading of Arnold’s poem that follows focuses on the 1

“minding” that “makes” the poem. This making through minding is pri- 2 marily mine as reader; however, my minding is guided by the etymology 3

of the poem’s language and the forms of its structural patternings, such as 4 meter, alliteration, repetition, and parallelism. I argue that by attending 5

to these cognitive processes of minding as revealed through the structural 6 and a ective workings of the poem’s meter and words, one may capture 7

something of the poet’s own minding in making a poem and thus pro- 8 vide insight into the cognitive workings of an individual mind, what it is 9

like to experience feeling. In my discussion of Arnold’s poem, I intro- 10 duce a notion of metaphor that re ects domain crossing between physical 11

experience and emotional response dependent upon the interrelationship 12 of physical sensory impressions and responses in the brain. This domain 13

crossing, in connecting external sensory impressions to Vico’s “modi ca- 14 tions in the human mind,” creates an actuality of experience for the reader 15

that, I claim, results in poetic iconicity.

. Arnold’s “Dover Beach”: The Aesthetics of Poetic Expression
19

Arnold’s (1903 [1890]: 226–27) “Dover Beach” is one of the best-known 20 poems in the English language and has generated a great deal of commen- 21

tary from both literary critics, such as Ian Lancashire (2009), and cognitive 22 psychologists and linguists (Holland 1968; Robinson 2005; Kövecses 2010). 23

Historically, the poem has been universally interpreted as a statement of 24 alienation arising from the secularization of the scienti c age ( Johnson 25

1952; Selkirk 1878). My reading di ers from these earlier ones, because it 26 focuses on the poem’s aesthetic patterns that lead us to experience its iconic 27

semblance of felt life. The poem presents many of the questions raised con- 28 cerning the aesthetic activity of the human mind, and critics have not sat- 29

isfactorily resolved them. Why does the poem resonate so strongly with us 30 even though its emphasis falls not on the calm scene with which the poem 31

opens but on the image of ignorant armies clashing by night with which it 32 ends? How can one (to cite an oft-raised question throughout the history 33

of art) feel pleasure in face of another’s expression of pain? How can we 34 experience emotions for characters and situations we know don’t exist (the 35

so-called paradox of ction [Hjort and Laver 1997])? Why does the poet 36 nd it necessary to refer to the literary past of Sophocles and Thucydides? 37

How can one account for the many dualisms in the poem and the seem- 38

39 23. In the past, the term cognitive has been equated with the purely conceptual processes of the mind. I use it here to mean all the processes of the mind, which include sensory percep- 40

tion and emotion as well as reasoning.

1 ingly contradictory stances taken by its speaker? An analysis of the poem 2 that traces the cognitive patterns of minding, both poet’s and reader’s, can, 3 I believe, shed light on these questions. 4 “Dover Beach” invites us to consider the nature of reality and our rela5 tionship to it, as the poet contemplates Vico’s historical cycles of Western 6 thought. The poem’s speaker at rst experiences the feeling of identi ca7 tion with the external world. He moves to a stage in which conceptualiza8 tion creates metaphoric analogy between human culture and the world. 9 He then reaches a nal stage of alienation, in which there is total discon10 nection between human emotions and external nature.

35 a popular activity in the secularizing movements of the nineteenth century. Arnold’s father,

36

who was a celebrated educator and headmaster at Rugby School, had read Vico and acknowledged his own debt to Vico’s thought (Thomas Arnold 1845: 82). Arnold would cer-

37 tainly have known of Ruskin’s theory as expressed in Modern Painters, which contrasts the sen-

38 sory perceptions of the early Greeks (especially Homer) with those of the medieval period

39 (especially Dante) and the loss of faith of the modern period that Ruskin found epitomized in the work of Sir Walter Scott.

. . The Minding of Arnold’s Poem

17

The history of Arnold’s writing of “Dover Beach” gives us insight into 18

his creative process and the development of his thinking as he relates the 19

poem’s di erent sections and images to each other. According to manu- 20

script evidence, the nine lines of the last stanza (lines 29–37) were written 21

in 1851, while Arnold and his wife were visiting Dover Beach to celebrate 22

their recent marriage, whereas the rst twenty-eight lines were not com- 23

posed until fteen years later (Lancashire 2009). With the exception of the 24

truncated meter of its rst and last lines, the last stanza is constructed in 25

iambic pentameter. It follows the standard rhyme scheme that Arnold used 26

for practically all of his sonnets, and it may be that he had rst conceived 27

of the poem in sonnet form. However, it concludes abruptly in what is 28

now line 37. The nality of the closure of both sentence and couplet rhyme 29

seems to have precluded the rest of the sonnet. Indeed, the substance of 30

the rst eight lines of this last stanza already contains the kind of turn that 31

one expects in the sestet section of a sonnet, in the contrast between the 32

seemingly positive features of “a land of dreams” and the somber, nega- 33

tive representation of the world “as on a darkling plain.” Even if one were 34

to see the onset of the turn as marked by the phrase “And we are here,” it 35

is extremely unusual to nd a sonnet turn occurring in the octet section 36

(it can be delayed after the ninth line but not introduced before it). The 37

38 26. I know of no sonnet, experimental or otherwise, that has its turn in the rst two qua- 39 trains. There are cases where experiments in sonnet form have reversed octave and sestet, notably in Rupert Brooke’s (1915: 166) “Sonnet Reversed” (1911) and Dylan Thomas’s (1957: 40

80–85) “Altarwise by Owl-light” (1936), and indeed I suggest that lines 15–28 of “Dover 41

738 Poetics Today :

1 nality of the last three lines, ending as they do with a couplet form remi2 niscent of the Shakespearian sonnet, makes it di cult to imagine how the 3 poem might have been continued. One can read the nal stanza therefore 4 as a failed sonnet, and this might partially explain why Arnold abandoned 5 it for fteen years before taking it up again and adding the preceding lines. 6 The poem in its nal form places this failed sonnet within a coherent 7 structural context that enables readers to follow the poet’s minding. The 8 poem falls into two almost equal parts: lines 1–20 and lines 21–37. The 9 rst part describes the physically experienced scene at Dover; the second 10 introduces the metaphoric analogy of “the Sea of Faith.” Both parts end 11 by bringing the historical past into the present, eternal moment— rst the 12 past of Sophocles, the Greek poet and dramatist, in lines 15–20 and then 13 that of the Greek historian Thucydides (1954: 459–61), in his account of 14 the battle of Epipolae, in lines 35–37. Embedded in this two-part struc15 ture is a tripartite structure that re ects variations of the sonnet form. The 16 rst stanza forms a complete sonnet in itself. The next two stanzas also 17 comprise fourteen lines but with the sestet occurring rst, and this octet18 sestet reversal crosses the divide of the poem’s two-part structure. The nal 19 stanza I have already remarked upon as a failed sonnet. These changes 20 in form move from the “calm” of the rst line, through the “cadence” 21 of the ebbing tide, to the “clash” of the last. They re ect the movement 22 from Vico’s rst stage, of identi cation between human emotions and the 23 world of sensory impressions, to his second stage, of creating an analogy 24 between human emotions and the world, and ending with the total sepa25 ration between human emotions and the external world that marks Vico’s 26 nal age of humans in the darkness of barbarism.

27

28

29 Beach” may be read as a sonnet in reverse. However, that is not what appears to be hap-

30 pening in Arnold’s nal stanza. In his explication of the sonnet form, John Fuller (1972: 28) refers to sonnet variations as constrained by “legitimate possibilities” and “genuine expres-
31 sions of its capabilities,” but nowhere does he allow for the possibility of a turn occurring

32 earlier than the sestet, though it may of course be delayed right up to the nal lines.

33 27. Vico (1948 [1744]: 381, §1106) believed that there would be a recycling (recorso) through 34 the three stages of gods, heroes, and people:

35

Through long centuries of barbarism, rust will consume the misbegotten subtleties of mali-

cious wits, that have turned them into beasts made more inhuman by the barbarism of re ec-

36

tion than the rst men had been made by the barbarism of sense. . . . Hence peoples who have

37

reached this point of premeditated malice, when they receive this last remedy of providence

and are thereby stunned and brutalized, are sensible no longer of comforts, delicacies, plea-

38

sures and pomp, but only of the sheer necessities of life. And the few survivors in the midst of

39

an abundance of the things necessary for life naturally become well behaved and, returning to

40

the primitive simplicity of the rst world of peoples, are again religious, truthful and faithful. Thus providence brings back among them the piety, faith and truth which are the natural foun-

41

dations of justice as well as the graces and beauties of the eternal order of God.”

. . Metaphor: Cause and E ect in Sense and Emotion

1

The poem opens with a speaker whose sensory perceptions are attuned to 2 the scene before him. The fourteen lines of the rst stanza have an uncon- 3

ventional sonnet form, oscillating between the ballad meters, which have 4 their source in the Germanic stress-timed meters of Old English poetry, 5

and the syllabo-tonic tradition of the Romance languages. This oscilla- 6 tion re ects the historical emergence of English poetry as the product 7

of a marriage or fusion between the two poetic traditions. The poem 8 shifts to iambic pentameter at the introduction of the “French coast,” com- 9

pared with the “cli s of England,” and culminates in the invocation to 10 the addressee in line 6. This transitional movement of historical prosody 11

is re ected in the way sensory perceptions move from images of sight in 12 the opening lines, through the synesthetic invocation to taste the sweet- 13

ness of the night air in the second quatrain, to images of sound in the ses- 14 tet. Arnold creates in this rst stanza a scene in which what we see, taste, 15

and hear creates in us certain emotional responses, feelings that we project 16 back onto the sources of our sense impressions to create a sense of identi- 17

cation between human “subjectivity” and “objective” reality, just as the 18 “grating roar” of the pebbles creates in the listener “the eternal note of 19

sadness.”

20

As we have seen, the idea that sensory experiences of the external world 21

can create emotional responses in us forms the basis of Vico’s explanation 22 of how images come to be present to the mind. When Zoltán Kövecses 23

(2010: 671) says of lines 13–14 in Arnold’s poem “of course we know that 24 waves cannot actually bring in sadness or notes of sadness—they can only 25

be metaphorically responsible for our sad mood when we hear the tremu- 26 lous cadence slow,” then he, like Ruskin, is representing metaphor as indicat- 27

ing the false impression given by the pathetic fallacy. However, I suggest 28 that the causality implied by Kövecses’s phrase “metaphorically respon- 29

sible” in fact re ects domain crossing among the physical sound, its musi- 30

cal “cadence,” and its emotional e ect on the listener.

31

32 28. Several attempts were made in the twentieth century to characterize the grammar of English poetry, from George Saintsbury’s (1961) monumental study to the work of such lin- 33

guists as Geo rey Leech (1969), Morris Halle and Samuel Jay Keyser (1971), Derek Attridge 34

(1982), and Richard Cureton (1992). My own unpublished dissertation (Freeman 1972) 35

explores the relation of English metrics to its sources in both Germanic and Romance poetic traditions. Fauconnier and Turner’s (2002) blending theory helped me reformulate my argu-

36

ment there in terms of the metaphor of English poetry as the child of two parents, where 37

the child carries traces of both but is itself unique. The emergent structure that results from 38

the product of this metrical marriage has never been, to my mind, fully modeled in English 39 metrical theory. 29. Of all art forms, music is the closest to pure sensory feeling, and there has been a great 40

deal of research by cognitive psychologists into the relation between music and the emotions 41

740 Poetics Today :
1 Arnold’s description of the sound of the receding tide is expressed 2 through the metaphor of music marked by the choice of the words cadence 3 and note in lines 13–14. As readers, we respond to the aesthetic pattern cre4 ated by the rhythmic sounds of the two lines that mimic the “tremulous5 ness” of syncopation, lines in which an anapestic rhythm occurs in two 6 syllables occupying one metrical position; the pattern of a trisyllabic word 7 followed by two and then by one in “tremulous cadence slow” becomes 8 three, one, one, and two in “eternal note [of ] sadness”; and the stressed 9 vowels modulate in form and order of occurrence: 10 With trémulous cádence slów, and bring 11 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 12 The etérnal nóte of sádness in. 13 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 14 An examination of Arnold’s manuscript changes to line 13 indicates that 15 he may be consciously distinguishing here between the fact that physical 16 sounds can cause emotional e ects and Ruskin’s pathetic fallacy. Describ17 ing the “grating roar” of the wave-driven pebbles, Arnold rst wrote “With 18 regular cadence slow” and then changed the adjective to “mournful.” This 19 became, in the published version, “With tremulous cadence slow.” The 20 progression of Arnold’s thinking is illuminating. The notion of regularity 21 serves as a commentary on the preceding line, “Begin, and cease, and then 22 again begin,” and therefore appears redundant, although identifying the 23 repeated regularity of the ebb and ow of the tide suggests the establish24 ment of Vico’s topoi in the mind. The term mournful anticipates the fol25 lowing lines, “and bring / the eternal note of sadness in.” The question is 26 why Arnold chose to substitute “tremulous” for “mournful.” The adjective 27 “mournful” in this context indicates that the sound of the pebbles’ roar is in 28 itself mournful, an example of Ruskin’s pathetic fallacy, whereas the adjec29 tive “tremulous” can apply to both the turbulent action of the waves and 30 the physical trembling of an emotional response. 31 By choosing the word tremulous, Arnold hits upon a description that 32 applies to the natural things of the world, including ourselves. That is, as 33 the movements of sound of the wave-driven pebbles vibrate and shake, 34 so we too can experience vibrations and shakings when we physically 35 tremble. This sensory identi cation, re ecting Vico’s description of the 36 rst people’s fear of thunder, is the sensory metaphor of emotional iden-
37
38 (Sloboda 2001). A recent article in Nature Neuroscience (Salimpoor et al. 2011) describes experi39 ments that show chemical changes, through dopamine increase in the brain, when listeners
anticipate and experience peak levels of favorite musical passages. Such research reinforces 40 the nding that domain mapping occurs across the physical and the a ective elements of 41 human experience.

ti cation, not the conceptual metaphor of analogy. In conventional con- 1

ceptual metaphor, the domains crossed are material (concrete) and intan- 2

gible (abstract); in attribution metaphors, the domains can be either both 3

material, as in “Juliet is the sun,” or both intangible, as in “Jove is thunder.” 4

Identity is e ected by means of Fauconnier’s (1997: 41) access (or identi - 5

cation) principle, which states that “an expression that names or describes 6

an element in one mental space can be used to access a counterpart of that 7

element in another mental space.” The phrase “tremulous cadence” cre- 8

ates a synesthetic identity between movement and sound, just as “grating 9

roar” does, and these identity connections cause a reaction in the hearer. 10

Arnold’s speaker in this rst stanza is not committing the pathetic fallacy 11

of claiming that the waves themselves are sad; he is claiming, contrary to 12

Kövecses’s statement quoted above, that sensory impressions do leave emo- 13

tional traces in our minds. So the aural receptivity of our brains enables 14

the force dynamics of physically representing the sound of the waves as an 15

emotional feeling in our minds. Kövecses’s “metaphorical responsibility” 16

implies a cause and e ect relationship between the physical acoustics of 17

the ebbing tide and the emotional feelings aroused in the mind. It is a 18

metaphor of cross-domain causality, which cognitive neuroscientists have 19

discovered actually occurs (see note 396).

20

This cross-domain causality challenges the division that dominated 21

Western thought in the past between the physical bodily domain of “objec- 22

tive” experience and the cognitive conceptual domain of the “subjective” 23

mind. In discussing the question of the relation between the physical and 24

the sensational/emotional, Ruskin (1856) notes that the objective/subjec- 25

tive distinction is ambiguous and misleading. Using the example of color, 26

he says that the de nition of “blue” as the sensation of color on the human 27

eye as we look at the sky or at a blue gentian ower has misled some phi- 28

losophers. They assume that there are “qualities of things that . . . depend 29

on our perception of them, and upon our human nature as a ected by 30

them” and consider these qualities to be subjective, as opposed to “the 31

qualities of things which they always have, irrespective of any other nature, 32

as roundness or squareness,” which are considered objective. In contrast, 33

Ruskin (1856: §2) argues that “the word ‘Blue’ does not mean the sensation 34

caused by a gentian on the human eye; but it means the power of producing 35

that sensation; and this power is always there, in the thing, whether we are 36

there to experience it or not, and would remain there though there were 37

not left a man on the face of the earth.”

38

39 30. In this way, Ruskin resolves the paradox of the old riddle of whether or not a tree makes a sound in the forest when it falls if no one is there to hear it. The falling tree has the power 40

to produce the sensation of noise regardless of who is or is not there.

742 Poetics Today :

1 Modern science con rms Ruskin’s nineteenth-century view in more

2 technical terms. As humans, we are able to see a world of color, because

3 our brains are adapted to register the wave spectrums that exist in the world

4 around us ( Jacobs and Nathans 2009). The ability to detect the full range

5 of the color spectrum results from a combination of trichromatic factors:

6 the properties of the object, the kind of light available, and the particular

7 vision system in the brain of the viewer. I suggest that there is a similar

8 process regarding the aural spectrum. We know that there are sound tones

9 that certain animals can hear and others cannot (Lipman and Grassi 1942;

10 War eld 1973; Fay and Popper 1994; Lopez-Poveda et al. 2010). The ability

11 to hear a range of sounds results from the properties that create sound

12 waves, the environmental conditions that regulate their transmission, and

13 the receptivity of the brain’s aural system. This is true for all ve senses. It

14 shows that we do not merely observe nature but are “mindful” as partici-

15 pants of it.

16 Modern research has furthered our knowledge of how we relate cog-

17 nitively to the world. The discipline of educational psychology has long

18 recognized the existence of three domains related to the brain: cognitive/

19 mental, a ective/emotional, and psychomotor/physical (Bloom 1956).

20 Cognitive psychologists have documented through many experiments the

21 physical and emotional reactions we experience when reading value-laden

22 words, whether positive or negative (see De Houwer and Hermans 2010

23 for a review of current research). Neuroscientists are beginning to discover

24 how cognitive, a ective, and psychomotor processes are interrelated and

25 integrated in brain functioning (LeDoux 1996; Damasio 2010).

26 According to Lako ’s (2006) summaries of current cognitive science

27 research (e.g., Regier 1996; Narayanan 1997a, 1997b; Rizzolatti et al.

28 2002), certain neural circuits in the brain structure sensory-motor obser-

29 vation, action, and stimulation and include image schemata and force

30 dynamic schemata. The

metaphor, Lako (ibid.: 163)

31 explains, “maps forces that result in motion onto causes that result in change.” In

32 Arnold’s poem, due to that metaphor the sound of the retreating tide that

33 is registered through the auditory system of our brains produces a feeling

34 of sadness. The rst stanza achieves this connection through the concep-

35 tual image schemata of OUT-IN and CHANGE. In line 5, the word out

36 carries extra weight owing to its placement on the metrical position that

37 occurs immediately after the prosodic caesura at position 4. It is syntac-

38 tically ambiguous. It may be attached to the verb in line 4, as in the cli s

39 “stand out,” or it may be understood as an adverb of place, with the cli s

40 lying “out,” away from the viewer. In either case, it is immediately followed

41 by its semantic opposite “in,” and this juxtaposition of “out in” introduces

Freeman • The Aesthetics of Human Experience 743

a major theme of the poem, with the adverbial “in” of line 14 paralleling 1

the “out in” of line 5: the - schema re ects the idea of the sensory 2

sound of a tide owing out in the world, bringing in a feeling of sadness into 3

the mind.

. . Iconicity: The Experience of Felt Life

6

Like Wills’s “for all eternity,” Arnold’s “eternal note” in line 14 carries the 7

aesthetic meaning of duration in the eternal present, as evidenced by the 8

immediately following invocation of a Sophoclean past, when the same 9

sound produces in the Greek poet a similar emotional response of human 10

misery, reinforced by the patterned repetition of “bring / . . . in” of lines 11

13–14 and “brought / Into” of lines 16–17. The relation between sensory 12

impressions and emotions is created by the imagination that all human 13

beings share, according to Vico’s concept of imaginative universals, a con- 14

cept that depends on Vico’s understanding of sensus communis. Though this 15

latter term is often translated as “common sense,” it is better understood 16

as “consensus”—the sense of what is held in common, that is, the under- 17

standing that the same principles of recollective understanding shape and 18

order all human societies and cultures. As Donald Phillip Verene (1981: 19

53) explains it, “In Vico’s view, common sense, or sensus communis, is not a 20

proto-scienti c form of knowledge, but the common way of experiencing 21

the world present in the life of a people. It is not a set of consciously formed 22

cognitive or empirical beliefs. The sensus communis of a people is rooted 23

in a common way of feeling, speaking, and symbolizing meaning in the 24

world.” That common way includes practical judgment and arises from 25

the poetic wisdom from which all knowledge springs and which is based on 26

imagination ( fantasia). Arnold invokes the natural quality of the sound of 27

pebbles thrown up by the ebbing tide to produce the e ect it does wherever 28

and whenever it occurs by connecting the speaker’s own experience with 29

historical memory of what Sophocles also heard and how he responded. 30

Arnold may have had in mind Sophocles’s (1954: 180, ll. 585–91) descrip- 31

tion of a similar scene in which the “hollow cry” resulting from the wind- 32

driven waves evokes the misery of human lives, “whose house is shaken by 33

the gods”:

34

35

Fortunate they whose lives have no taste of pain,

For those whose house is shaken by the gods

36

escape no kind of doom. It extends to all the kin

37

like the wave that comes when the winds of Thrace

38

run over the dark of the sea.

39

40

31. I owe this observation to Meir Sternberg.

744 Poetics Today :

1

The black sand of the bottom is brought from the depth;

2

The beaten capes sound back with a hollow cry.

3 Cross-domain metaphors between the physical and the emotional that

4 invoke knowledge of the sensus communis are imaginative universals in

5 Vico’s sense and thus create archetypal icons of human experience.

6

The use of conceptual schemata in aesthetic patterning reveals how

7 aesthetics provides insights into the workings of the human mind. The

8 experience of Arnold’s “Dover Beach” lies in its expressions of mutability,

9 of change that brings about feelings of insecurity and vulnerability. The

10 CHANGE schema, conceptually building upon the sensory, informs the

11 images of the poem as it simulates the reality of the world around us. That

12 is, though the poem opens with the image of a tide at full, its fullness is

13 only momentary; as soon as high tide occurs, it immediately begins to

14 recede, and it is this withdrawing that is the subject of the poem—not the

15 rising but the falling of the tide. In a similar vein, the moonlight is itself

16 not static; just as the light “gleams and is gone” from the coast of France,

17 so the moonlight gives way to the “night-wind” and the “darkling plain” of

18 the poem’s conclusion. Norman N. Holland (1968: 116) notes the contrast

19 between “sweet sight and disillusioning sound” in the poem, but the rela-

20 tionship of sight and sound is closer and more complex. Both are subject

21 to change; just as the tide turns, moonlight gives way to darkness, bright

22 faith at the full must inevitably retreat in “melancholy, long, withdrawing

23 roar” to the darkness of the “night-wind.” The world that “lies before us”

24 at the full, like the “Sea of Faith” that “lay” at the full “like a bright girdle,”

25 has in fact “no light,” and we are left, like Sophocles’s victims who cannot

26 escape their doom, with Sophocles’s “taste of pain” that accompanies us

27 “here” on Thucydides’s “darkling plain” of the world.

28

The second part of the second stanza marks a transition from sensory

29 identi cation to conceptualization, as the speaker now nds in the sound

30 not an emotion but “a thought.” The transition is marked by the semi-

31 colon dividing the two parts related within one line: “Of human misery;

32

33 32. Lancashire (2009) also cites other possible sources for Arnold’s reference to Sophocles.

34 Arnold would have read Sophocles in the original; however, Richard Jebb’s (Sophocles 1891) translation that Lancashire (2009) quotes is intriguing because of its use of the word mournful:
35

36

[583] Blest are those whose days have not tasted of evil. For when a house has once been shaken by the gods,

37 [585] no form of ruin is lacking, but it spreads over the bulk of the race, just as, when the surge is

38

driven over the darkness of the deep by the erce breath of Thracian sea-winds, [590] it rolls up the black sand from the depths, and the wind-beaten headlands that front the

39

blows of the storm give out a mournful roar.

40 Elizabeth Wycko ’s translation of hollow given in the text avoids this appearance of the 41 pathetic fallacy.

Freeman • The Aesthetics of Human Experience 745

we.” The rst-person plural pronoun suggests not only the inclusion of 1

the speaker and the addressee within the poem but the possibility that the 2

reader is being addressed too, so that nding thought in sound may apply 3

universally to all humankind. This stanza thus serves as a bridge between 4

the sensory metaphor of attribution, in the identi cation of sound with 5

sadness, to the conceptual metaphor of analogy, in the relation of sound to 6

thought.

7

The third stanza makes this “thought” explicit, as the speaker trans- 8

forms the images of the rst stanza into a conceptual metaphor of analogy, 9

with both tide and faith “at the full.” Thus the actual fullness of the tide 10

that was described in the opening lines becomes the metaphoric high point 11

of the “Sea of Faith.” This movement from sensory causality to concep- 12

tual analogy in human thought occupies only three lines (21–23) of the 13

entire poem, since this stage modulates into the nal and decadent stage of 14

humankind’s alienation from nature and the divine, just as the tide, when 15

it reaches its highest and fullest point, immediately begins to recede.

16

The speaker no longer consciously experiences an emotional response 17

to the sound of the retreating tide; emotional response subsides into 18

the precognitive background as he “now . . . only” hears in the sound 19

an analogy to the melancholy loss of faith. The divorce of humankind 20

from sensory identi cation with nature is complete. The images of the rst 21

stanza darken: the cadence of the continuous ebb and ow of the pebbles, 22

here recurring as “shingles,” is now heard only as a withdrawal, long and 23

melancholy; the sweetness of the night air is transformed into the more 24

ominous “breath / of the night-wind,” the cli s that stood out “glimmer- 25

ing and vast” have become “the vast edges drear”; the shingles are naked. 26

The withdrawal of a faith that enabled the calmness and moonlit land of 27

the opening scene to be seen as “the folds of a bright girdle” investing the 28

world (in the sense of clothing it) prepares for the nal loss: the last stanza 29

marks Vico’s (1948 [1744]: 59, §159) nal age of human barbarism of the 30

intellect in “subduing that acerbity of minds still bound to the body.”

31

The speaker in the nal stanza is one who rejects the idea that endows 32

the external world with human feeling. According to Vico (1990 [1709]), 33

this objectivization of the natural world is a consequence of the scienti c 34

view, the development of human thought that splits sensory and emo- 35

tional feelings from rational exploration. Though rejecting any connec- 36

33. In using the phrase “sensory and emotional feelings,” I am following Antonio Damasio 37 (2003: 28), who distinguishes sensations and emotions, on the one hand, from feeling, on the 38 other: “Emotions play out in the theater of the body. Feelings play out in the theater of the 39 mind. . . . Emotions and related phenomena [e.g., sensations] are the foundation for feel- 40 ings, the mental events that form the bedrock of our minds.” A sensory or emotional feeling, in my usage, indicates that the sensation or emotion has reached conscious awareness. 41

746 Poetics Today :
1 tion between human feelings and the natural world, the speaker recognizes 2 that something has been lost in the process: that “truth” can perhaps reside 3 only in the social compact of human relations, the kind of truth that Vico’s 4 new science opposes to scienti c truth. 5 But as readers, we are still shocked by Arnold’s ending and may be 6 led to ask why his armies in the nal line of the poem are ignorant. He 7 could have chosen “hostile” or “warring” or some other two-syllable adjec8 tive that would have described more typically the nature and function of 9 armies. By choosing “ignorant,” Arnold is penetrating through external, 10 prosaic description to capture an inner, more explanatory notion of some11 thing lacking in these armies. We are led to ask what it is that they don’t 12 know, to begin to realize that perhaps their not knowing is the cause of 13 their hostilities. The adjective opens up a range of ideas and possibilities 14 beyond words, revealing, in Ruskin’s (1856) words, “a more essential truth 15 than is seen at the surface of things.” It is no accident that Arnold ends his 16 poem on this note, since it invokes Vico’s age of nal barbaric darkness 17 before the recorso to the rst stage begins again, a darkness far more invidi18 ous than that which our earliest ancestors experienced (see note 27). In this 19 age, which began with the development of conceptual thought, we have 20 been made ignorant of the truth of human existence that is intimately con21 nected to the natural world through the relation of sensory impressions to 22 emotional feelings. So Arnold’s call to “be true / To one another!” works 23 to force us back into reconnecting with the truths that the poem presents 24 by tracing what has been lost to humankind in the modern, scienti c age.

. Conclusion
27
28 An analysis of the structural patterning or wen of a poetic text, because it 29 reaches down into the depths of the way language can be made to work aes30 thetically, creates a means by which we are able to reconnect consciously 31 with the precategorial sensations and emotions that our preconscious 32 minds experience. My reading of “Dover Beach” reveals the synthesizing 33 capabilities of the poetic mind as it imaginatively creates a uni ed and 34 harmonious whole that underlies the seemingly contradictory attitudes of 35 the speaker manifest on the surface of the poem. By fusing the otherwise 36 separate elements of sensory impressions and emotional feelings within the 37 imagination of the poem’s speaker, Arnold simulates for the reader a felt 38 reality, what it is like to feel connected to the world we experience. This 39 imaginative identi cation does not depend primarily on conceptual, ana40 logical reasoning but on gestalt intuition arising from Vico’s principles, 41 which were mentioned in the introduction and are formulated as follows:

Tseng Proof • 2011.11.18 15:35

8989 Poetics Today • 32:4 • Sheet 130 of 151

Freeman • The Aesthetics of Human Experience 747

1. Both poet and reader engage in aesthetic activity in “making” ( poesis) 1

the images of “Dover Beach” present to the mind. Thus Arnold shows 2

the way the mind works through sensory perception and expresses 3

through his poem the intuitions that are internal to the mind. The 4

knowledge that results comes not from experimentation, as in the sci- 5

ences, but from felt experience.

6

2. Art as making enables both poet and reader to experience on a deeper 7

level the natural relation of sensory and emotional experiences that 8

underlie conceptual formation. Arnold imaginatively fuses the sensa- 9

tions of the tide’s ebb and ow with the emotional resonances of sad- 10

ness to create an identi catory relationship that supersedes Western 11

ideas of objective reality and human subjectivity.

12

3. The conceptual analogy that creates the “Sea of Faith” metaphor 13

through the schemata of - and

is built upon the intu- 14

itive fusion of subjective feelings that arise from memory and imagi- 15

nation. Thus Arnold’s poem focuses on the necessary, a priori status 16

of intuition, without which conceptualization is not possible.

17

4. The sensus communis of the imaginative universal also makes pos- 18

sible the synthesis of past memory with present experience. Arnold 19

invokes Sophocles’s hearing of and responding to the same sound and 20

Thucydides’s description of the Athenians’ confusion on the plains 21

of Epipolae to create a metaphysical, “eternal” truth about commu- 22

nal human experience not as generalization but within the particular 23

rendering of imaginative identity.

24

5. The analysis of forms and structures in what is made ( poesis) reveals 25

the patterns and repetitions of philological traces (memoria) and philo- 26

sophical invention (ingegno) through the operations of the imagination 27

( fantasia). Examining these patterns and repetitions within the con- 28

text of a gestalt intuition of the whole poem shows the unity of per- 29

ception that underlies the super cially irregular forms of Arnold’s 30

poem.

31

The question still remains, however, how, if at all, the methodologies of 32 the sciences and of the arts are interlinked. In his rst book On the Study 33 Methods of Our me, Vico (1990 [1709]) claims that his theory is not just 34
35

34. Although I have traced in Arnold’s poem a progression of thought, the overall impres- 36

sion we receive is a holistic and immediate feeling of presence. As George Gleason (personal 37

communication) comments: “For me, there is no progression in the poem from beginning 38

to end; rather it is all encompassed in a ‘present’ image of life, at least as the poet was then 39 experiencing it. Whatever logic sequence there is in its progression from beginning to end, it is overwhelmed by the immediacy of its emotional impact.” Gleason’s comment indicates 40

the poem’s iconicity in creating a moment of the aesthetically eternal present.

748 Poetics Today :

1 equivalent but superior to the Cartesian science of his time on all mat2 ters related to human a airs. Vico’s theory of memoria is attractive on sev3 eral counts. It places poetic wisdom at the beginning of human thought 4 and not as an incidental or accidental afterthought. It also explains, by 5 relating the natural intuitions of sensory and emotional identi cation with 6 the experienced world, how an imaginative expression that is unique in its 7 individual particularity can nevertheless invoke the imaginative universals 8 established by the sensus communis of universal human experience. 9 As the means by which poetry achieves the semblance of a felt reality, 10 aesthetic iconicity accounts theoretically for the relation between emo11 tional and sensory experiences. Langer (1953: 245) expresses it this way: 12 “To create the poetic primary illusion, hold the reader to it, and develop 13 the image of reality so it has emotional signi cance above the suggested 14 emotions which are elements in it, is the purpose of every word a poet 15 writes.” The processes of minding, metaphor, and iconicity in poetic 16 expression provide the groundwork for describing the aesthetic structures 17 of the imaginative faculty that are integral elements for the development 18 of a comprehensive theory of mind.

sure, the relating of our emotional feelings as we read the text to the experiences it expresses. 41
