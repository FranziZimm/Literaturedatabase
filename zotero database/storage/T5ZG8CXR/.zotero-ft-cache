How do humans construct their mental representations of the passage of time? The universalist account claims that abstract concepts like time are universal across humans. In contrast, the linguistic relativity hypothesis holds that speakers of different languages represent duration differently. The precise impact of language on duration representation is, however, unknown. Here, we show that language can have a powerful role in transforming humans’ psychophysical experience of time. Contrary to the universalist account, we found language-specific interference in a duration reproduction task, where stimulus duration conflicted with its physical growth. When reproducing duration, Swedish speakers were misled by stimulus length, and Spanish speakers were misled by stimulus size/quantity. These patterns conform to preferred expressions of duration magnitude in these languages (Swedish: long/short time; Spanish: much/small time). Critically, Spanish-Swedish bilinguals performing the task in both languages showed different interference depending on language context. Such shifting behavior within the same individual reveals hitherto undocumented levels of flexibility in time representation. Finally, contrary to the linguistic relativity hypothesis, language interference was confined to difficult discriminations (i.e., when stimuli varied only subtly in duration and growth), and was eliminated when linguistic cues were removed from the task. These results reveal the malleable nature of human time representation as part of a highly adaptive information processing system.

Human existence revolves around time, yet we cannot touch or see time. How do humans experience the passage of time, and how do they construct their mental representations of it? A key finding is that concepts from the more tangible domain of space are often used to represent the passage of time (for overviews; Bender & Beller, 2014; Núñez & Cooperrider, 2013). This tendency is par-

ticularly visible in language, where spatial concepts are often recruited to express both duration (e.g., “a long meeting”) and succession (“Monday comes before Tuesday”; e.g., H. H. Clark, 1973; Traugott, 1978). A possibility then is that duration is primarily represented through spatial schemas, possibly due to an innate tendency to associate time with space (e.g., Lourenco & Longo, 2010; Srinivasan & Carey, 2010) and/or overlapping cortical processing of these domains (Walsh, 2003).
However, another possibility is that language not only reflects our inclination to associate time with space, but it actually shapes our thinking about it. In this view, the spatial schemas reflected in conceptual metaphors (e.g., “long time”) provide the basis for our mental representation of duration (Lakoff & Johnson, 1980). This idea receives further support in the finding that our representations of abstract domains may be more susceptible to linguistic influence compared with concrete domains such as color or objects (Borghi & Binkofski, 2014). Under this account, then, speakers of different languages would represent time differently (consistent with the linguistic relativity hypothesis, Whorf, 1956). For instance, speakers of English and Swedish, who primarily talk about time as “long” and “short,” would represent duration differently from speakers of Spanish and Greek, who talk about time as “big” and “small” (Casasanto, 2005b; Lakoff & Johnson, 1980; Núñez & Cooperrider, 2013).

Here, we ask whether these different ways of talking about duration indeed lead speakers of different languages to represent the passing of time differently. We show that duration representation can change as a function of the presence of different linguistic cues in a simple duration estimation task. Surprisingly, switching the language context in the same bilingual individual also transforms the way they estimate duration. In three experiments, we implement a psychophysical task (Casasanto, 2005b) to investigate the effects of language on duration estimation in monolingual and bilingual speakers of Spanish and Swedish. These languages exhibit robust differences in the preferred patterns of duration expressions, with Swedish speakers preferring distancebased metaphors (e.g., “long time”) and Spanish speakers preferring amount-based metaphors (e.g., “much time”; Figure 1).
In the task, participants either reproduced the duration of computer-generated animations showing either a container that filled gradually with liquid, or a line gradually growing on the screen. The fill level of the containers and the distance of the lines were irrelevant for duration reproduction. Instead, these displacements tested to what extent participants were able to disregard spatial information when estimating duration (Casasanto & Boroditsky, 2008). If language usage patterns correlate with humans’ representation of duration, it can be predicted that because Spanish speakers talk about duration in terms of amount, the fill level of the containers should interfere with their duration estimations to a larger extent than among Swedish speakers, who do not talk about duration in the same way. Conversely, because Swedish speakers talk about duration in terms of distance, the distance of the growing lines should interfere with duration estimation to a larger extent than is the case for Spanish speakers. We expect these cross-linguistic differences to be more apparent in the presence (Experiment 1) rather than in the absence (Experiment 2) of linguistic cues. If language meddles with temporal cognition, then we also expect Swedish-Spanish bilinguals to behave differently in this task depending on the language of the cues (Experiment 3).
Figure 1. Distributive frequencies of amount- and distance-based duration metaphors in Spanish and Swedish. Based on Google hits using the relevant search tools. The cross-linguistic difference is significant at .0001 level (␹2 ϭ 3.12 ϫ 105, df ϭ 1). Amount-based metaphors for Spanish include mucho tiempo (‘much time’) and poco tiempo (‘little time’), and for Swedish mycket tid (“much time”) and lite tid (“little time”). Distancebased metaphors for Spanish include largo/tiempo/largo (“long time”) and corto/tiempo/corto (“short time”), and for Swedish lång tid (“much time”) and kort tid (“short time”).

Additionally, findings from a different perceptual domain (color) suggest that language is more likely to affect perceptual judgments of stimuli that are more difficult to discriminate (colors that are closer together in the spectrum) than of stimuli that are more easily discriminated (colors that are further apart in the spectrum; Winawer et al., 2007). The current psychophysical task (Casasanto, 2005b) includes stimuli with varying degrees of duration and physical growth. We compared spatial interference for “extreme stimuli: (those with the longest and shortest durations and physical growth in the stimulus set) and “medium stimuli” (those with medium durations and physical growth) in all experiments. Because the perceptual properties of extreme stimuli in a given stimulus set are more easily discerned (Winawer et al., 2007), we hypothesized that medium stimuli would be more difficult to process, thus yielding a stronger language effect on temporal cognition. A preexperimental study independently confirmed that extreme stimuli elicited more precise duration reproductions than medium stimuli (Experiment 1).
Our findings show that duration estimation varied as a function of the presence of linguistic cues (Experiments 1 and 2), language context of operation (Experiment 3), and stimulus type (all experiments). We conclude that human temporal cognition is malleable, as part of a highly adaptive computational system, in which language flexibly functions as a source of information for duration estimation.
Experiment 1. Crosslinguistic Differences in Time Reproduction in the Presence of Verbal Prompts
Method
Participants. Forty native Spanish speakers and 40 native Swedish speakers were randomly assigned to either the container condition or the line condition. Participants were university students in Madrid and Stockholm, respectively. In the absence of previous studies, we assumed a medium-sized effect (␩p2 ϭ .06) of the interaction between language group and stimulus type, alpha level of .05, along with default sample correlation and nonsphericity values (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, & Buchner, 2007), which yielded a recommended sample size of 36 participants (Experiments 1 and 2). We thus slightly oversampled (40 participants), factoring in certain attrition (see below).
Materials. The growing lines and filling containers experiments (Casasanto, 2005b) were used to assess duration reproduction.
Line condition. Computer-generated black lines grew from left to right against a white background. Nine different line distances, ranging from 100 to 500 pixels (with 50-pixel increments), and 9 different line durations, ranging from 1,000 ms to 5,000 ms (with 500-ms increments) were fully crossed to produce 81 unique line stimuli.
Container condition. A 600-pixel high ϫ 500-pixel wide black frame against a white background represented an empty container. Containers were filled in black from the bottom and up. Nine fill levels (ranging from 100 to 500 pixels with 50-pixel increments) were crossed with 9 durations (ranging from 1,000 to 5,000 ms with 500-ms increments) to produce 81 distinct container stimuli.
All animations were presented in a 700 ϫ 700 pixel field.

Procedure. Participants were tested individually by a native speaker of the relevant language, using a 15.6-in. laptop. Each stimulus (line or container) was presented twice, resulting in a total of 162 trials. Half of the times, the participants estimated stimulus duration, and the other half they estimated displacement (distracter task). Spatial reproduction trials and temporal reproduction trials were randomly intermingled. Instructions for duration reproduction were void of spatial expressions (e.g., “estimate the time it took . . . ” instead of “estimate how long it took . . . ”).
A prompt preceded each stimulus, indicating whether duration or displacement was to be estimated. The prompt consisted of a symbol (an hourglass for duration and a cross for displacement estimation) and a verbal label. For duration reproduction, the labels were default expression of duration in Spanish (duración) and Swedish (tid). For displacement reproduction, the labels were either avstånd (‘distance’) or mängd (‘amount’) in Swedish, and distancia (‘distance’) or cantidad (‘amount’) in Spanish. Participants reproduced duration by clicking the computer mouse once, waiting the appropriate time, and clicking again. Displacement was reproduced by clicking the mouse once, moving it the appropriate distance/height, and clicking again. Presentation orders were fully randomized.
Following previous studies on time estimation (Casasanto, 2005b; Casasanto & Boroditsky, 2008), participants were removed if they estimated distance instead of time, or their overall duration estimations were markedly inaccurate (if the slope of the correlation between actual and estimated duration was Ͻ.5). Five Swedish and five Spanish participants were consequently removed.1
Stimulus norming. The precision of duration reproductions for medium stimuli (2,000 – 4,000 ms and 200 – 400 pixels) and extreme stimuli (1,000; 1,500; 4,500; 5,000 ms and 100, 150, 450, 500 pixels) was measured by calculating the discrepancy between actual duration and reproduced duration. As the current design rests on a robust effect of stimulus type, we assumed a large effect size (␩p2 ϭ .14) and thus sampled 24 Spanish and 24 Swedish speakers (not part of the main experiments), who were randomly allocated to reproduce duration in either the line or the container condition. Two participants were excluded due to poor performance (see above).
For the line condition, a 2 (group: Spanish vs. Swedish) ϫ 2 (stimulus type: medium vs. extreme) mixed analysis of variance (ANOVA) yielded a significant main effect of stimulus type, F(22, 1) ϭ 12.639, p Ͻ .01, ␩p2 ϭ .367, showing that reproductions were significantly more precise for extreme than for medium stimuli. A similar result was obtained for the container condition, F(22, 1) ϭ 12.155, p Ͻ .01, ␩p2 ϭ .390 (Table 1). No significant interactions or main effects of group were found.
Design. Following Casasanto and Boroditsky (2008), the degree to which stimulus displacement interfered with duration reproduction was computed by calculating the duration estimates for each fill level/distance, and then entering these two variables into a regression to obtain the slope. Higher slopes indicated proneness to estimate larger displacements as having longer duration, and were thus indices of greater spatial interference. Slopes were calculated separately for medium and extreme stimuli, and served as the dependent variable in the analyses.
Participants’ overall accuracy for reproducing duration and displacement (distracter task) was controlled for (see the online supplemental material).

Results
In the container condition, a 2 (language: Spanish vs. Swedish) ϫ (stimulus type: extreme vs. medium) mixed ANOVA showed a significant interaction, F(1, 33) ϭ 10.59, p ϭ .003, ␩p2 ϭ 0.24. Spanish speakers showed more interference than Swedish speakers, but only for medium stimuli (p ϭ .009). In the line condition, a mixed ANOVA with the same variables revealed a significant interaction, F(1, 33) ϭ 7.62, p ϭ .009, ␩p2 ϭ 0.19. Swedish speakers showed more interference than Spanish speakers only for medium stimuli (p ϭ .001; Figure 2A). Such crosslinguistic differences conform to previous evidence showing similar patterns for English and Greek speakers reproducing duration in the presence of linguistic cues (Casasanto, 2005b), and are compatible with the linguistic relativity hypothesis (Whorf, 1956).
Experiment 2: Do Crosslinguistic Differences in Time Reproduction Persist in the Absence of Verbal Prompts?
To test the persistence of the effects found in Experiment 1 in a strictly nonverbal context, we removed the verbal labels in the prompts appearing before each trial.
Method
Forty different native Swedish speakers (students in Stockholm) and 40 different native Spanish speakers (students in Madrid) were randomly assigned to either the container condition or the line condition. Three Spanish and five Swedish participants were removed due to poor performance.
Materials and procedures were identical to Experiment 1, with the crucial exception that the label in the prompt was removed, leaving only the symbol (hourglass or cross).
Results
Contrary to what linguistic relativity would predict, we found no interaction between language and stimulus type, in either the line
1 Extended, repetitive psychophysical tasks like the present one inevitably yield certain participant exclusion (e.g., 22% exclusion rate in Casasanto & Boroditsky, 2008; 30% in Casasanto, 2005b), presumably due to impatience and/or fatigue.

condition, F(1, 33) ϭ 0.99, p ϭ .328, ␩p2 ϭ .029 or the container conditio, F(1, 33) ϭ 0.03, p ϭ .871, ␩p2 ϭ .001. Instead, interference patterns of Spanish and Swedish speakers were strikingly similar (see Figure 2B). Moreover, both language groups seemed to display slightly greater spatial interference in the lines condition than in the containers condition. There were no significant main effects.
Experiment 3: Does Switching the Prompt Language Trigger Different Interference Patterns Within the
Same Individual?
The results of Experiments 1 and 2 give rise to the possibility that human temporal cognition flexibly adapts to environmental constraints such as the presence or absence of verbal cues. Comparing the performance of bilingual speakers operating in different language contexts allows for this critical test. If temporal cognition is indeed adaptive as a function of language, then the same bilingual individual should exhibit different interference patterns depending on the language context.
Method
Seventy-four adult Swedish–Spanish bilinguals performed either the container condition or line condition. The sample size was based on the parameters outlined in Experiment 1 and adapted for within-subjects analyses. Materials and procedures were identical to Experiment 1 with the exception that the distracter task was removed to minimize fatigue. Nine participants were removed due to poor performance. Participants took the experiment twice, once with Spanish and once with Swedish prompt labels (order counterbalanced).
Results
For the bilinguals in the container condition, a 2 (language context: Spanish vs. Swedish) ϫ 2 (stimulus type: extreme vs. medium) repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant in-

teraction, F(1, 34) ϭ 9.38, p ϭ .004, ␩p2 ϭ 0.22. Specifically, for medium stimuli, interference levels changed significantly in the direction predicted by the prompt language (p ϭ .018; see Figure 2C).
Likewise, for bilinguals in the line condition, a 2 ϫ 2 repeated measures ANOVA yielded a significant interaction between language context and stimulus type, F(1, 29) ϭ 5.18, p ϭ .028, ␩p2 ϭ 0.15. Again, interference for medium stimuli changed significantly as the prompt language changed (p ϭ .04; Figure 2C). No significant main effects of language were found for extreme stimuli in either condition.
Discussion and Conclusions
Using a simple psychophysical task in different language populations we have shown that language can influence humans’ representation of the passage of time. Linguistic cues yielded language-specific spatial interference in time estimation, while in the absence of such cues language-specific interference disappeared. Further, language-specific interference was confined to difficult discriminations. Our approach to manipulate different language prompts in the same population of bilinguals revealed context-induced adaptive behavior: prompts in Language A induced Language A-congruent spatial interference. When the prompt switched to Language B, interference became Language B-congruent instead. To our knowledge, this study provides the first psychophysical demonstration of shifting duration representations within the same individual as a function of language context.
A central question then concerns the likely mechanism that underlies the reported effects. According to the label-feedback hypothesis (Lupyan, 2012), the perception of a given stimulus may be warped through coactivation of its corresponding verbal label. The degree of top-down modulation of language can then be regulated by manipulating the presence of the corresponding verbal label (Lupyan & Ward, 2013). In the current study, the labelfeedback hypothesis would predict greater linguistic modulation in the presence of language prompts rather than in their absence,

which was found in Experiments 1 and 2. However, the prompts used here do not contain the labels that would have to be involved in such modulation (i.e., spatiotemporal metaphors), and the fine temporal and spatial increments in the stimuli do not readily trigger labeling in the same way that colors or objects would (Casasanto & Bottini, 2014; Dolscheid, Shayan, Majid, & Casasanto, 2013). More importantly though, if the stimuli would readily lend themselves to labeling, the label-feedback hypothesis would predict greater language-specific spatial interference for the extreme stimuli, as these would be more likely to activate labels such as “long” and “short.” However, it was precisely for the extreme stimuli that no language-specific effects could be detected.
The current results may still be interpreted as an online warping of temporal judgments, but one that goes beyond a one-to-one mapping between label and percept. Under the predictive processing account (A. Clark, 2013; Hohwy, 2013; Kanai, Komura, Shipp, & Friston, 2015), a percept is coconstructed in a continuous interplay between downward flowing predictions and upward flowing sensory signals. The downward predictions are the system’s expectations given its knowledge about the world and the context, but are also continuously updated by perceptual input. Language constitutes one such source of prior knowledge, but also a potentially powerful bottom-up contextual cue (Lupyan & Clark, 2015).
Under this account, the verbal prompts used in the current study constitute contextual cues (rather than ready stimulus labels), triggering spreading activation of semantically related linguistic knowledge (Çukur, Nishimoto, Huth, & Gallant, 2013), in this case language-specific duration metaphors, which, in turn, transitorily warp temporal processing. The powerful nature of this warping is most poignantly seen in the bilingual speakers: varying the language of the prompts changes what prior knowledge is recruited, thus yielding different language-specific modulations of duration estimation, within the same individual. Our findings also support the idea that the more ambiguous the input is, the less weight it has on perception, thus increasing the system’s reliance on prior knowledge (Lupyan & Clark, 2015). This explains the reliance on linguistic knowledge in the harder-to-process medium stimuli, as opposed to the easier-to-process extreme stimuli, where no topdown linguistic modulation was found.
Predictive processing is Bayesian optimality-driven, striving for a complete match between the bottom-up signal and the top-down expectations. The strong inclination humans have to associate time and distance (Srinivasan & Carey, 2010) could explain both language groups’ tendency to reproduce long line distances as longer in time in the absence of linguistic cues (Experiment 2). This raises a question regarding the precise impact of linguistic cues on a system that may already be optimized to predict correspondence between distance and duration. In Spanish speakers, the inclination seems to be overridden by the presence of linguistic cues triggering language-derived expectations, as indexed by the minimal spatial interference in the line condition (Experiment 1). In Swedish speakers, however, this inclination matches the linguistically derived knowledge, which could increase the expectation of distance-duration correspondence. Their difference in interference slopes between Experiment 1 and Experiment 2 is however within the error margin, indicating a potential ceiling effect of the influence of top-down information on duration estimation.

By showing that language, under certain circumstances, can transform the basic psychophysical experience of the passing of time, the current findings align with important advances in linguistic relativity research highlighting that the effects of language on cognitive processing is not an either-or phenomenon, but are instead highly dynamic and context-bound (e.g., Athanasopoulos et al., 2015; Athanasopoulos & Bylund, 2013; Kersten et al., 2010; Montero-Melis, Jaeger, & Bylund, 2016). Specifically, the findings show that the strong inclination among humans to represent time through spatial schemas may be modulated by the specific ways these schemas are instantiated in different languages. The attested modulations conform to behavioral and neural evidence of the role of words as targeted manipulations that selectively enhance or mute the influence of any other aspect of prior knowledge, including which specific language the system may rely upon to inform top-down modulations (Athanasopoulos et al., 2015; Lupyan & Clark, 2015). Our approach to vary the language context within the same bilingual individual reveals that the observed patterns of behavior are language-induced (rather than the artifact of some between-subjects, extralinguistic cultural factor; Casasanto, 2005a; Levinson & Majid, 2013). This resonates with the emerging view of a highly adaptive human computational system, in which language can serve as a critical source of information for processing experience.
