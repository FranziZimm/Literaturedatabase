MASTER

TROPES

By KENNETH BURKE

I REFER to metaphor, metonymy, synecdoche, and irony. And my primary concern with them here will be not with their
purely figurative usage, but with their r6le in the discovery and description of "the truth." It is an evanescent moment that we shall deal with - for not only does the dividing line between the figurative and literal usages shift, but also the four tropes shade into one another. Give a man but one of them, tell him to exploit its possibilities, and if he is thorough in doing so, he will come upon the other three.
The "literal" or "realistic" applications of the four tropes usually go by a different set of names. Thus:
For metaphorwe could substituteperspective; For metonymywe could substitutereduction; For synecdochewe could substituterepresentation; For irony we could substitutedialectic. We must subsequentlytry to make it clear in what respectswe think these substitutions are justifiable. It should, however, be apparentat a glance that, regardlessof whether our proposed substitutions are justifiable, considered in themselves they do shade into another,as we have said that the four tropes do. A dialectic, for instance, aims to give us a representationby the use of mutually related or interacting perspectives- and this resultant perspective of perspectiveswill necessarilybe a reductionin the sense that a chart drawn to scale is a reductionof the area charted. Metaphor is a device for seeing something in terms of something else. It brings out the thisness of a that, or the thatness of

422

KENYONREVIEW

a this. If we employ the word "character"as a general term for whatever can be thought of as distinct (any thing, pattern, situation, structure, nature, person, object, act, rBle, process, event, etc.,) then we could say that metaphor tells us something about one characteras considered from the point of view of another character. And to consider A from the point of view of B is, of course, to use B as a perspectiveupon A.
It is customaryto think that objective reality is dissolved by such relativity of terms as we get through the shifting of perspectives (the perceptionof one characterin termsof manydiverse characters). But on the contrary,it is by the approachthrough a variety of perspectivesthat we establish a character'sreality. If we are in doubtas to what an objectis, for instance,we deliberately try to consider it in as many different terms as its nature permits: lifting, smelling, tasting, tapping, holding in differentlights, subjecting to different pressures,dividing, matching, contrasting, etc.
Indeed, in keeping with the older theory of realism (what we might call "poetic realism," in contrast with modern "scientific realism") we could say that characterspossess degrees of being in proportion to the variety of perspectives from which they can with justice be perceived. Thus we could say that plants have "morebeing" than minerals,animalshave more being than plants, and men have more being than animals, because each higher order admits and requiresa new dimension of terms not literally relevant to the lower orders.
By deliberatecoachingand criticismof the perspectiveprocess, characterscan be consideredtentatively, in terms of other characters, for experimental or heuristic purposes. Examples may be offered at random: for instance, human motivation may, with varying degrees of relevance and reward, be consideredin terms of conditioned reflexes,or chemicals,or the class struggles,or the love of God, or neurosis, or pilgrimage, or power, or movements of the planets, or geography, or sun spots, etc. Various kinds of

FOURTROPES

423

scientific specialists now carry out the implications of one or another of such perspectiveswith much more perseverancethan that with which a 17th Centurypoet might in one poem pursue the exploitation of a "conceit."
In Permanenceand Change I have developed at some length the relationship between metaphor and perspective. I there dealt with such perspectivesas an "incongruity,"because the seeing of something in terms of something else involves the "carrying-over" of a term from one realm into another, a process that necessarily involves varying degrees of incongruityin that the two realms are never identical. But besides the mere desire not to restate this earlier material, there is another reason why we can hurry on to our next pair (metonymy and reduction). For since the four pairs overlap upon one another, we shall be carrying the first pair with us as we proceed.

2.
Science, concerned with processes and "processing," is not properly concerned with substance (that is, it is not concerned with "being," as "poetic realism" is). Hence, it need not be concerned with motivation. All it need know is correlation. The limits of science,qua science,do not go beyondthe statementthat, when certain conditions are met, certain new conditions may be expected to follow. It is true that, in the history of the actual developmentof science,the discoveryof such correlationshas been regularlyguided by philosophies of causation ("substantial"philosophies that were subsequently"discredited"or were so radically redefined as to become in effect totally different philosophies). And it is equally true that the discoveryof correlationshas been guided by ideational forms developed through theology and governmental law. Such "impurities"will always be detectible behind science as the act of given scientists; but science qua science is abstractedfrom them.
Be the world "mind," or "matter," or "both," or "several,"

424

KENYONREVIEW

you will follow the same procedurein striking a match. It is in this sense that science, qua science, is concerned with operations rather than with substances,even though the many inventions to do with the chemistryof a match can be traced back to a source in very explicit beliefs about substancesand motivationsof nature -and even of the supernatural.
However, as soon as you move into the social realm, involving the relation of man to man, mere correlationis not enough. Human relationships must be substantial, related by the copulative, the "is" of "being." In contrastwith "scientificrealism,""poetic realism" is centered in this emphasis. It seeks (except insofar as it is affected by the norms of "scientific realism") to place the motives of action, as with the relation between the seminal (potential) and the growing (actualized). Again and again, there have been attemptsto give us a "scienceof human relations"after the analogy of the natural sciences. But there is a strategic or crucial respect in which this is impossible; namely: there can be no "science"of substance,except insofar as one is willing to call philosophy, metaphysics, or theology "sciences" (and they are not sciences in the sense of the positive scientific departments).
Hence, any attempt to deal with human relationshipsafter the analogy of naturalisticcorrelationsbecomes necessarilythe reduction of some higher or more complex realm of being to the terms of a lower or less complex realm of being. And, recalling that we propose to treat metonymy and reduction as substitutes for each other, one may realize why we thought it necessarythus to introduce the subject of metonymy.
The basic "strategy"in metonymyis this: to convey some incorporealor intangible state in terms of the corporealor tangible. E.g., to speak of "the heart" rather than "the emotions." If you trail language back far enough, of course, you will find that all our terms for "spiritual"states were metonymic in origin. We think of "the emotions," for instance, as applying solely to the realm of consciousness,yet obviously the word is rooted in the

FOURTROPES

425

most "materialistic"term of all, "motion" (a key strategyin Western materialismhas been the reductionof "consciousness"to "motion"). In his Principles of LiteraryCriticism,Richardsis being quite "metonymic"in proposing that we speak not of the "emotions" aroused in the readerby the work of art, but the "commotions."
Language develops by metaphorical extension, in borrowing words from the realm of the corporeal, visible, tangible and applying them by analogy to the realm of the incorporeal,invisible, intangible; then in the course of time, the original corporeal reference is forgotten, and only the incorporeal, metaphorical extension survives (often because the very conditions of living that reminded one of the corporeal reference have so altered that the cross reference no longer exists with near the same degree of apparentness in the "objectivesituation" itself); and finally, poets regain the original relation, in reverse,by a "metaphoricalextension" back from the intangible into a tangible equivalent (the first "carrying-over"from the material to the spiritualbeing compensated by a second "carrying-over"from the spiritualback into the material); and this "archaicizing"device we call "metonymy."
"Metonymy"is a device of "poeticrealism"- but its partner, "reduction,"is a device of "scientific realism." Here "poetry" and "behaviorism"meet. For the poet spontaneouslyknows that "beautyis as beautydoes" (that the "state"must be "embodied" in an actualization). He knows that human relations require actions, which are dramatizations,and that the essential medium of dramais the posturing,tonalizing body placed in a materialscene. He knows that "shame,"for instance, is not merely a "state,"but a movement of the eye, a color of the cheek, a certain quality of voice and set of the muscles; he knows this as "behavioristically" as the formal scientificbehavioristwho would "reduce"the state itself to these correspondingbodily equivalents.
He also knows, however, that these bodily equivalents are but part of the idiom of expression involved in the act. They are

426

KENYONREVIEW

"figures."They are hardly other than "symbolizations." Hence, for all his "archaicizing"usage here, he is not offeringhis metonymy as a substantialreduction. For in "poetic realism,"states of mind as the motives of action are not reducible to materialistic terms. Thus, though there is a sense in which both the poetic behaviorist and the scientific behaviorist are exemplifying the strategyof metonymy (as the poet translatesthe spiritualinto an idiom of material equivalents, and may even select for attention the same bodily responses that the scientist may later seek to measure), the first is using metonymy as a terminological reduction whereas the scientific behaviorist offers his reduction as a "real" reduction. (However, he does not do this qua scientist, but only by reasonof the materialistmetaphysics,with its assumptions about substanceand motive, that is implicit in his system.)

3. Now, note that a reduction is a representation. If I reduce the contours of the United States, for instance, to the terms of a relief map, I have within these limits "represented"the United States. As a mental state is the "representation"of certainmaterial conditions, so we could - reversingthe process- say that the material conditions are "representative"of the mental state. That is, if there is some kind of correspondencebetween what we call the act of perception and what we call the thing perceived, then either of these equivalents can be taken as "representative" of the other. Thus, as reduction (metonymy) overlaps upon metaphor (perspective) so likewise it overlaps upon synecdoche (representation).
For this purposewe considersynecdochein the usual range of dictionarysense, with such meaningsas: part for the whole, whole for the part, containerfor the contained, sign for the thing signified, material for the thing made (which brings us nearer to metonymy), cause for effect, effect for cause, genus for species, species for genus, etc. All such conversionsimply an integral re-

FOURTROPES

427

lationship, a relationshipof convertibility,between the two terms. The "noblest synecdoche,"the perfect paradigmor prototype
for all lesser usages, is found in metaphysicaldoctrinesproclaiming the identity of "microcosm"and "macrocosm." In such doctrines, where the individual is treated as a replica of the universe, and vice versa, we have the ideal synecdoche,since microcosmis related to macrocosmas part to whole, and either the whole can representthe part or the part can representthe whole. (For "represent"here we could substitute"be identified with.") One could thus look through the remotest astronomical distances to the "truthwithin," or could look within to learn the "truthin all the universe without." Leibniz's monadology is a good instance of the synecdochicon this grand scale. (And "representation"is his word for this synecdochicrelationship.)
A similar synecdochicform is present in all theories of political representation,where some part of the social body (either traditionally established, or elected, or coming into authority by revolution) is held to be "representative"of the society as a whole. The pattern is essential to Rousseau'stheory of the volonte gene'rale, for instance. And though there are many disagreements within a society as to what part should representthe whole and how this representationshould be accomplished, in a complex civilization any act of representationautomatically implies a synecdochicrelationship (insofar as the act is, or is held to be, "truly representative").
Sensory representationis, of course, synecdochic in that the senses abstractcertainqualities from some bundle of electro-chemical activitieswe call, say, a tree, and these qualities (such as size, shape, color, texture,weight, etc.) can be said "trulyto represent" a tree. Similarly,artisticrepresentationis synecdochic,in that certain relations within the medium "stand for" corresponding relations outside it. There is also a sense in which the well-formed work of art is internallysynecdochic,as the beginning of a drama contains its close or the close sums up the beginning, the parts all

428

KENYONREVIEW

thus being consubstantiallyrelated. Indeed, one may think what he will of microcosm-macrocosmrelationshipsas they are applied to "society"or "the universe," the fact remains that, as regards such a "universe"as we get in a well-organized work of art, at every point the paradoxes of the synecdochicpresent themselves to the critic for analysis. Similarly,the realmof psychology (and particularlythe psychology of art) requiresthe use of the synecdochic reversals. Indeed, I would want deliberately to "coach" the concept of the synecdochicby extending it to cover such relations (and their reversals) as: before for after, implicit for explicit, temporalsequencefor logical sequence,name for narrative, disease for cure, hero for villain, active for passive. At the opening of The Ancient AMarinefro, r instance,the Albatrossis a gerundive: its nature when introducedis that of something to be murdered, and it implicitly contains the future that is to become explicit. In Moby Dick, Ahab as pursueris pursued; his action is a passion.
Metonymy may be treated as a special application of synecdoche. If, for instance,after the analogy of a correlationbetween "mind and body" or "consciousnessand matter (or motion)" we selected quality and quantity as a "synecdochicallyrelated pair," then we might propose to treat as synecdochethe substitutionof either quantity for quality or quality for quantity (since either side could be considered as the sign, or symptom, of the other). But only one of these, the substitution of quantity for quality, would be a metonymy. We might say that representation(synecdoche) stressesa relationshipor connectednessbetween two sides of an equation,a connectednessthat, like a road, extends in either direction, from quantity to quality or from quality to quantity; but reductionfollows along this road in only one direction,from quality to quantity. 1
1Unfortunatelyw, e mustmodifythis remarksomewhat.Reductiona,s per scientificrealism,would be confinedto but one direction. Reduction, thatis, as the word is now generallyused. Butoriginally,"reduction"

FOURTROPES

429

Now "poetic realism," in contrast with "scientific realism," cannot confine itself to representation in this metonymic, onedirection sense. True, every art, in its nature as a medium, reduces a state of consciousnessto a "corresponding"sensorybody (so material that it can be reproduced,bought and sold). But the aim of such embodimentis to produce in the observera correspondingstate of consciousness(that is, the artistproceedsfrom "mind" to "body" that his representativereduction may induce the audienceto proceed from "body"to "mind"). But there is an important difference between representing the quality of an experience thus and reducing the quality to a quantity. One might even "represent"the human body in the latter, reductive sense, by reducing it to ashes and offering a formula for the resultant chemicals. Otto Neurath's "isotypes" (see his Modern Man in the Making, or our review of it, "Quantity and Quality," in the appendix of The Philosophy of Literary Form) are representations in the latter, reductive sense, in contrast with the kind of representationwe get in realisticportrait-painting.
Our point in going over this old ground is to use it as a way of revealing a tactical errorin the attempt to treat of social motivations. We refer to the widespreadbelief that the mathematicoquantitativeideal of the physical sciencescan and should serve as the ideal of the "social sciences," a belief that has led, for instance,to the almost fabulous amassingof statisticalsurveysin the name of "sociology." Or, if one insisted upon the right to build "sciences"after this model (since no one could deny that statistics are often revealing) our claim would be that science in this restricted sense (that explains higher orders by reduction to lower

was used in ways that make it closer ratherto the marginof its overlap upon "perspective,"as anything considered in terms of anything else could be said to be "reduced"- or "broughtback" ("referred") - to it, so that the considerationof art in terms of morality,politics, or religion could have been called "the reduction" or art to morality, or politics, or religion.

in conformitywitha representativaenecdote- whereasanecdotes "escientificallys"electedfor reductivepurposesarenot representative.

lectic. That is, if you isolate any one agent in a drama, or any one advocatein a dialogue, and see the whole in terms of his position alone, you have the purely relativistic. And in relativism there is no irony. (Indeed, as Cleanth Brooks might say, it is the very absence of irony in relativism that makes it so susceptible to irony. For relativism sees everything in but one set of terms and since there are endless other terms in which things could be seen, the irony of the monologue that makes everything in its image would be in this ratio: the greater the absolutism of the statements, the greater the subjectivityand relativity in the position of the agent making the statements.)
Irony arises when one tries, by the interactionof terms upon one another, to produce a development which uses all the terms. Hence, from the standpoint of this total form (this "perspective of perspectives"), none of the participating "sub-perspectives" can be treated as either preciselyright or preciselywrong. They are all voices, or personalities,or positions, integrallyaffectingone another. When the dialectic is properly formed, they are the number of charactersneeded to produce the total development. Hence, revertingto our suggestion that we might extend the synecdochic pattern to include such reversible pairs as disease-cure, hero-villain, active-passive,we should "ironically"note the function of the disease in "perfecting"the cure, or the function of the cure in "perpetuating"the influencesof the disease. Or we should note that only through an internal and external experiencing of folly could we possess (in our intelligence or imagination) sufficient "characters"for some measure of development beyond folly.
People usually confuse the dialectic with the relativistic.Noting that the dialectic (or dramatic) explicitly attempts to establish a distinct set of characters,all of which protest variously at odds or on the bias with one another, they think no further. It is certainly relativistic, for instance, to state that any term (as per metaphor-perspective)can be seen from the point of view of any

FOURTROPES

433

other term. But insofar as terms are thus encouraged to participate in an orderlyparliamentarydevelopment, the dialecticof this participation produces (in the observer who considers the whole from the standpoint of the participation of all the terms rather than from the standpointof any one participant) a "resultantcertainty" of a different quality, necessarily ironic, since it requires that all the sub-certaintiesbe consideredas neither true nor false, but contributory(as were we to think of the resultantcertaintyor "perspectiveof perspectives"as a noun, and to think of all the contributoryvoices as necessarymodifiersof that noun).
To be sure, relativismis the constanttemptation of either dialectic or drama (consider how often, for instance, Shakespeareis called a relativist). And historians for the most part are relaivistic. But where one considersdifferenthistoricalcharactersfrom the standpoint of a total development, one could encourage each characterto comment upon the others without thereby sacrificing a perspectiveupon the lot. This could be got particularly,I think, if historical charactersthemselves (i.e., periods or cultures treated as "individual persons") were considered never to begin or end, but rather to change in intensity or poignancy. History, in this sense,would be a dialecticof charactersin which, for instance, we should never expect to see "feudalism"overthrownby "capitalism" and "capitalism"succeeded by some manner of national or international or non-national or neo-national or post-national socialism - but rathershould note elements of all such positions (or "voices") existing always, but attaining greater clarity of expression or imperiousness of proportion at one period than an-
other. Irony is never Pharisaic,but there is a Pharisaictemptationin
irony. To illustrate the point, I should like to cite a passage from a poet and critic who knows a good deal about irony, and who is discussing a poet who knows a good deal about irony - but in this particularinstance, I submit, he is wrong. I refer to a passage in which Allen Tate characterizesthe seduction scene in The

434

KENYONREVIEW

Waste Land as "ironic" and the poet's attitude as that of "humility." (I agree that "humility"is the properpartnerof irony but I question whether the passage is ironic enough to embody humility.)
Mr. Tate characterizesirony as "that arrangementof experience, either premeditatedby art or accidentally appearing in the affairsof men, which permits to the spectatoran insight superior to that of the actor."And he continues:
Theseductionsceneis thepictureof modernanddominatinmg an. The arroganceand prideof conquestof the "smallhouseagent's clerk"arethebadgeof science,bumptioupsracticalityo,verweening secularfaith. Theverysuccessof thisconqueswt itnessesits aimless characteri;t succeedsas a wheel succeedsin turning;he can only conqueragain.
His own failureto understandhis positionis irony,and the poet'sinsightinto it is humility. But for the graceof God, says the poet in effect,therego I. There is essentiallythe poetic attitude, an attitudethat Eliot has been approachingwith increasingpurity.
We need not try to decide whether or not the poet was justified in feeling "superior"to the clerk. But we may ask how one could possibly exemplify an attitude of "humility" by feeling "superior"? There is, to be sure, a brand of irony, called "romantic irony," that might fit in with such a pattern - the kind of irony that did, as a matterof fact, arise as an aestheticopposition to cultural philistinism, and in which the artist considered himself outside of and superiorto the role he was rejecting.And though not "essentiallythe poetic attitude,"it is essentiallya poetic attitude,an attitudeexemplifiedby much romanticart (a sort of pamphleteering,or external, attitude towards "the enemy").
True irony, however, irony that really does justify the attribute of "humility,"is not "superior"to the enemy. (I might even here rephrasemy discussionof Eliot in Attitudes Toward History by saying that Eliot's problem in religion has resided preciselyin his attempt to convert romantic irony into classic irony, really to replace a state of "superiority"by a state of "humility"- and

KENYONREVIEW

A third temptation of irony is its tendency towards the simplification of literalness. That is: although all the charactersin a dramaticor dialectic developmentare necessaryqualifiersof the definition,there is usually some one characterthat enjoys the role of primus inter pares. For whereas any of the charactersmay be viewed in terms of any other, this one charactermay be taken as the summarizingvessel, or synecdochicrepresentative,of the development as a whole. This is the role of Socratesin the Platonic dialogue, for instance - and we could similarly call the proletariat the Socratesof the Marxist Symposiumof History, as they are not merely equal participantsalong with the other characters,

the victimof a theft; he representsthe victim. He would not crudelysteal a purse; rather,he joins forces with the owner of the purse - and it is only when the harsh realities of this imperfect world have imposed a brutallydivisive clarityupon the situation,that Falstaffis left holding the purse. He producesa new quality,a state of synthesisor merger- and it so happens that, when this synthesis is finally dissociatedagain into its analyticcomponents (the cruditiesof the realm of practicalproperty
relationshipshaving reducedthis state of qualitativemergerto a state of quantitativedivision), the issue as so simplifiedsums up to the fact that the pursehas changedhands. He converts"thine"into "ours"- and it is "circumstanceos ver which he has no control" that go to convert this "ours" into a "mine." A mere thief would have directly converted
"thine" into "mine." It is the addition of these intermediatesteps that makesthe vital differencebetween a mere thief and Falstaff;for it is precisely these intermediatesteps that mark him with a conviviality,a sociality, essentiallyreligious - and in this sympatheticdistortion of religious values residesthe ironyof his conception.
We might bring out the point sharplyby contrastingFalstaffwith Tartuffe. Tartuffe, like Falstaff, exploits the cooperativevalues for competitive ends. He too would convert "thine" into "mine" by putting it throughthe social alembicof "ours." But the conceptionof Tartuffeis not ironic,since he is purehypocrite. He uses the religiousvalues simply as a swindler. Tartuffe'spiety, which he uses to gain the confidenceof his victims,is a mere deception. WhereasTartuffeis all competitionand merely simulatesthe sentimentsof cooperation,Falstaff is genuinely cooperative,sympathetic,a synecdochicpartof his victim - but along with such rich gifts of identification,what is to preventa purse from changing
hands?

but also representthe end or logic of the developmentas a whole. This "most representative"characterthus has a dual function:
one we might call "adjectival"and the other "substantial." The characteris "adjectival,"as embodying one of the qualifications necessaryto the total definition, but is "substantial"as embodying the conclusionsof the developmentas a whole. Ironyis sacrificed to "the simplificationof literalness"when this dualityof role is neglected (as it may be neglected by either the reader, the writer,or both). In Marxismas a literally libertarianphilosophy, for instance, slavery is "bad," and is so treated in the rhetoricof proletarian emancipation (e.g., "wage slavery"). Yet from the standpoint of the development as a whole, slavery must be treated ironically, as with Engel's formula: "Without the slavery of antiquity, no modern socialism." Utilization of the vanquished by enslavement, he notes, was a great cultural advance over the wasteful practiceof slaying the vanquished.

Irony, as approachedthrough either dramaor dialectic, moves us into the area of "law" and "justice" (the "necessity"or "inevitability" of the lex talionis) that involves matters of form in art (as form affects anticipation and fulfilment) and matters of prophecy and prediction in history. There is a level of generalization at which predictions about "inevitable" developments in history are quite justified. We may state with confidence, for instance, that what arose in time must fall in time (hence, that any given structure of society must "inevitably" perish). We may make such prophecymore precise,with the help of irony,in saying that the developments that led to the rise will, by the further course of their development, "inevitably" lead to the fall (true irony always, we hold, thus involving an "internal fatality," a principle operating from within, though its logic may also be grounded in the nature of the extrinsic scene, whose properties contributeto the same development.)

The point at which different casuistries appear (for fitting these "general laws of inevitability" to the unique cases of history) is the point where one tries to decide exactly what new characters,bornof a given priorcharacter,will be the "inevitable"vessels of the prior character'sdeposition. As an over-all ironic formula here, and one that has the quality of "inevitability,"we could lay it down that "what goes forth as A returnsas non-A." This is the basic pattern that places the essence of drama and dialectic in the irony of the "peripety,"the strategicmoment of reversal.
