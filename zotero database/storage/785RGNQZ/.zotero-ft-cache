Preface: how to use this book

Preface

The present book is obviously not the first introduction to linguistics for students of English. It complements and competes with a number of related titles, some published in Britain and the United States for international audiences, and some published in Germany with the needs of a more local readership in mind. Some of what this book presents is, of course, new and original material not found elsewhere; a fair amount, however, is just the basic stuff which undergraduates in English have to master if they want to understand the complexities of the structure and the use of the (foreign) language they have decided to focus on in their studies.
Nevertheless, the author has a clear justification for publishing just this book at just this time. It is the unified perspective it is written from – a perspective which he hopes will be useful and productive for the intended audience.
A first factor which motivates the present project is an external political one. Currently, in Germany, Austria and Europe as a whole, higher education is being profoundly transformed, the most conspicuous outward sign of reform being the restructuring of entry-level undergraduate courses in the B. A. framework. The present book is a response to this in that it aims to meet bachelor students’ needs without diluting and lowering academic standards.
Secondly, the book aims to present linguistics not as such, or out of context, but specifically for students of English, i. e. students wishing to make productive use of what they learn about language and linguistics in other areas of their academic courses (cultural studies, literature) and in their later professional careers in language teaching, the media, public relations or similar areas of language- and culture-related professional activity.
Thirdly, the book is not designed as a manual of information to be learned and reproduced, but as an invitation to explore the fascinating complexity which the English language, and languages in general, display both in their structure and in their use. The focus is thus on learner autonomy as an essential first step towards independent research.
As readers will see, each of the following 14 units has the following structure:
1. Orientation 2. Demonstration/discussion 3. Problems and challenges 4. Practice

PREFACE

The reader’s careful attention is invited for the first. The reader’s own initiative, activity and creativity are vital prerequisites to the success of the other three. To help readers with basic concepts and terminology, the book contains a comprehensive glossary at the end. If you experience difficulties with some of the exercises, or if you want to check your results, you can consult the web-page
 accompanying the book at www.bachelor-wissen.de, which gives you the solu-
tions. This site also contains useful additional material and sound samples. The book will no doubt serve many practical purposes – as a class text,
in helping students prepare for their exams, or as a reference work consulted occasionally. Beyond that, however, I hope that readers will retain a few essential insights even after they have forgotten about the inevitable detail, such as the lesser-used symbols of the phonetic alphabet, or some technical definition of a grammatical concept, or the specifically New Zealand realisations of the short front vowel phonemes. These include:
– a fascination with the intricate structural complexity of the English language, and – by implication – that uniquely human endowment, the language faculty;
– an appreciation of the diversity of a global language, of the many varieties of English that have arisen in response to the expressive, social and cultural needs of an extremely heterogeneous community of speakers; and – not least –
– a theoretically grounded understanding of the true role of language in society.
The importance of the part played by language in fostering human community and society cannot be over-estimated. And yet public debates about language issues are still too often informed by half-truths and myths – propagated by educators, politicians, cultural critics. What the trained linguist can bring to this debate is two scientific virtues: a respect for empirical data and a commitment to rational argument. In the public discourse on the shape of English and the role the language plays in the world today, this is still a much needed contribution.
I would not like to close this preface without a few heartfelt words of gratitude – to Dr. Birgit Waibel, English Department of the University of Freiburg, for invaluable help in the final stages of the project, in preparing diagrams, the solutions to the exercises and the web-page accompanying the book, to Luminita Trasca, also of Freiburg, for patient and competent proof-reading, and to Jürgen Freudl, Narr Publishers, who was a stern taskmaster when it came to deadlines and a constructively critical reader of a previous version of the present book.

Unit 1
Introduction – linguistic and other approaches to language

Orientation

1.1

Any book introducing undergraduate students to a new academic field, its terminology and investigative methods must start by answering the defining question, which in our case is simply: “What is linguistics?”
To say that “linguistics is the rational and systematic scientific study of language, usually based in institutions of higher learning such as colleges or universities” seems a fairly helpful first approximation. Of course, in offering an answer to this first question, I have raised two more. First, it is not at all clear what we mean by “language” in an academic-linguistic context. The every-day English word language has multiple meanings (as do its equivalents in other languages), as can easily be demonstrated by comparing its meaning in the following two sentences (see Exercise 1 below for further examples):

What is linguistics?

The language of the British press has changed considerably over the past few decades. Language is what distinguishes human beings from apes.

In the first example, the word language denotes a particular functional variety of one specific language, in this case English, whereas in the second it could be glossed as the “ability to learn and use any of a large number of human languages.”
Secondly, while its home in universities as one academic discipline among others is secure, the precise status of linguistics as a science is contested territory (as we shall see in many places throughout this book). Is linguistics part of the humanities, close to literary and cultural studies, with which it shares an interest in the phenomenon of style for example? Is it an empirical social science, using quantitative and qualitative methods to study the communicative networks among people which ultimately constitute society? Is it an experimental science like psychology, studying the role of language in human cognition, or the place of language-acquisition in the development of the human personality? Or is it a natural science, in that it helps us to understand the complex physiology of the human speech apparatus, or the neurological basis of language both in the healthy person and in those suffering from various kinds of language disorder or language loss?
This incomplete list of possible orientations in linguistics opens up many vistas which the present introduction will not explore. Its aims are more practi-

INTRODUCTION – LINGUISTIC AND OTHER APPROACHES TO LANGUAGE

Linguistics – the prehistory of the field

cal and limited. The first is to equip readers with the terminology and methods necessary to describe present-day English, the language they have made the focus of their studies, both in its structure and in its use. The second aim is to introduce students to the major theoretical positions and trends in the field, so as to give them the basis for independent further work. And not least the book aims to show where a knowledge of linguistics can be made productive outside the field, for example in the teaching and learning of foreign languages, or for developing a more sophisticated grasp of language-related issues in literary and cultural studies.
But how did the burgeoning discipline of linguistics arise historically? In answering this question, we cannot help but be struck by an apparent paradox. We find signs of people’s keen interest in linguistic issues for practically the whole recorded history of humanity, but dispassionate scientific objectivity in the study of language, the scholarly study of language for its own sake, or – for short – linguistics as an academic discipline, are historically very recent pursuits.
One marvel which seems to have caused people to wonder in many places and at different times in history is the fact that human beings live in a world of many languages, which is obviously impractical. A well-known non-scholarly answer to this puzzle is contained in the Old Testament of the Bible (Genesis 11), where multilingualism is explained as God’s punishment for the human pride manifested in the attempt to build the enormous Tower of Babel.

ORIENTATION

Unit 1

Within one and the same language community, people are keenly aware of sometimes very slight differences in pronunciation, grammar or vocabulary. In a British context, for example, “aitch-dropping,” technically speaking the dropping of initial /h/ in stressed syllables, is a strong social marker. If someone says ’eavy metal music instead of heavy metal music, the contrast is trivial, and any confusion about the intended meaning is unlikely. However, this detail of pronunciation will instantly mark out the speaker as either educated, standard or middle-class (if heavy is pronounced with h) or uneducated, non-standard or working-class (if the aitches are dropped). Of course, the general public, including literary writers, are aware of this, so that aitch-dropping becomes available as an efficient device for literary characterisation, as it does, for example, in the case of Uriah Heep (from Charles Dickens’ David Copperfield), who deceptively styles himself as ’umble (← humble) all the time. The motif is taken up by the rock band of the same name, whose best-known album is also called Very ’eavy, very ’umble.
Among those fascinated by aspects of language long before the emergence of linguistics as a specialised discipline have been major philosophers. The classical Greek thinker Plato (428/27 BC – 348/47 BC), for example, seems to have thought a lot about the question of whether the name (i. e. the sound of a word) has any natural or logical correspondence to the person, thing, quality, activity or process it refers to, or whether this relation is arbitrary.
If we think of verbs such as German zischen or English hiss, we might tend to give credence to the former view – the sound of the words seems to be motivated by the sound in the real world. If we think about a sound sequence such as /i: l/, we will tend to favour the latter as this sound sequence corresponds to Igel “hedgehog” in German and eagle “Adler” in English, and it is difficult to see any connection whatsoever between either animal and the words used to refer to them. In the typical fashion of a dialogical Platonic argument, the philosopher develops a compromise position: Kratylos argues that names are motivated; Hermogenes claims that they are arbitrary; Socrates moderates between the two.
Modern linguists are less circumspect and tend to agree that Hermogenes’ position is the appropriate one. First, there are far more words for which the relation between sound and meaning is arbitrary than there are “onomatopoetic” forms in which the sound of the words appears to imitate some natural sound. Secondly, even those words which seem to be imitations of actual natural sounds turn out to be highly arbitrary and language-specific on closer inspection. Note, for example, that the initial letter <z> in German zischen, which corresponds to the sounds /ts/, would be a forbidden combination in English (see Exercise 5 below for further discussion).
Apart from philosophical concerns about language, there have also been practical ones. Language teaching, for example, has a history to look back on which is at least as old as the philosophical debate about language. In fact,

INTRODUCTION – LINGUISTIC AND OTHER APPROACHES TO LANGUAGE
two of the seven Classical “liberal arts,” which formed the core curriculum of higher education well into the Early Modern period, are language-related, namely grammar (which in the old understanding included the study of pronunciation) and rhetoric.

For a long time, the foreign languages which were studied and taught most were Latin, Greek and Hebrew, the three “sacred” languages of the Bible. From the 16th and 17th centuries onwards more and more of the modern European languages started developing coherent traditions of producing teaching and refer-

ence materials, such as dictionaries and grammar books. Some of the works which have come down to us over the ages clearly reveal a lot of linguistic insight, but as a whole this tradition does not amount to more than a precursor of the scholarly “linguistic” perspective on language. Figure 1.3 presents the title page of one such practical grammar of English, which was presumably produced for the benefit of German immigrants to British North America.
Another pre-cursor of academic linguistics is the tradition of textual criticism which first flowered during the Renaissance, when scholars looked at ancient texts from classical antiquity very closely in order to determine their authentic versions, which had often been corrupted in centuries of transmission. Very often, such a comparison of extant manuscript versions was a necessary step to prepare the first printed editions of these texts. This pursuit soon became known as philology (from the ancient Greek for “love of the word” or “love of language”). Originally, philology comprised the study of language and literature. Today the term is preserved in expressions such as “Englische Philologie,” one of the traditional German designations of English Studies. In a modern linguistic context, the term philology refers to the specialist study of language history, especially in the context of editing texts.
Finally, the fact that Europeans conquered and colonised ever growing portions of the world meant that many new and exotic languages were encountered, translated from and into, documented and taught. Arabic, Chinese, Persian and the ancient and modern languages of India thus became of interest to Europeans. This meant that, slowly but surely, a critical mass of knowledge about languages accumulated which led to the birth of linguistics as an academic discipline of study toward the end of the 18th century.
In this early phase, language scholars’ orientation was strongly historical. Building on an insight first formulated in 1786 by William Jones (1746–1794), who worked as a judge on behalf of the British East India Company in Calcutta, subsequent generations of scholars traced the history of the various members of what was later to be referred to as the Indo-European family of languages in order to reconstruct their common origin (proto-Indo-European or Ursprache)

and their mutual relationship. In particular, Jones’ seminal insight had been to note systematic correspondences between Sanskrit, an ancient language of the Indian subcontinent, and Ancient Greek which made it plausible to trace both back to a common historical source (see Unit 12 for further information on historical relationships among the Indo-European languages, esp. Fig. 12.1).
What was found out in the course of the 19th century still holds in its essence today. The Celtic languages spoken in the very West of Europe, the Germanic, Romance, Slavic languages, some languages of the Baltic region (Latvian, Lithuanian), Albanian, Greek, Persian and some of the major languages of the Indian subcontinent such as Hindi or Punjabi all go back to a common ancestor. Before the emergence of historical-comparative linguistics, people indulged in bizarre speculations on historical relationships between languages and peoples on the basis of a few pairs of words which sounded similar. Today, we have a rigid methodology to assess the value of such claims, and people who will still argue for direct links between the civilisations of ancient Asia and ancient America just because a few place names, names for gods or foodstuffs happen to sound similar are fortunately not taken seriously any more – a modest triumph of science over speculation.
One practitioner of historical-comparative linguistics, Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913), based at the University of Geneva in Switzerland, was instrumental in bringing about a re-orientation of approach which has dominated the field to the present day. He pointed out that the diachronic study of language (i. e. the study of its development through time) did not make it possible to understand how languages worked at any given point of time. The most trivial argument to prove this is, of course, that we can speak and write a language perfectly without knowing anything at all about its history. For example, it does not bother us in the least that the word nice meant “difficult” a few centuries ago, as is shown by the following extract from Daniel Defoe’s well-known novel Moll Flanders:

I was really with child [= pregnant]. This was a perplexing thing because of the Difficulty which was before me, where I should get leave to Lye Inn; it being one of the nicest things in the World at that time of Day, for a Woman that was a Stranger, and had no Friends, to be entertain’d in that Circumstance without Security, which by the way I had not, neither could I procure any. (Daniel Defoe, Moll Flanders. 1722: ch. 32)

The context here makes clear that the situation is far from nice in the present sense of “pleasant.” At the time, the word meant “difficult, tricky.” Looking around hard enough, we can find some old-fashioned or fossilised usages of nice which remind us of this older use even today, for example, a nice distinction (i. e. a difficult or pedantic distinction).
De Saussure proposed that the most appropriate approach to the scholarly study of language should be a synchronic one, with a focus on how a language

functioned as a structural system at any given time. In practice the move from the diachronic approach to the synchronic one often meant that the focus of interest shifted from the oldest stages of the language (in the case of English the Old English period lasting from c. 500 to c. 1100) to the contemporary language, but this does not necessarily have to be the case. We can study Old English from a synchronic perspective, for example, by showing how it worked as a structured system at a given point in time, let’s say the well-documented period immediately before the Norman Conquest in 1066. Alternatively, we can take a diachronic approach to present-day English, for example by showing which processes of historical change are going on right now.
Fig. 1.5 William, Duke of Normandy, “the Conqueror,” from the Bayeux Tapestry

What unites both historical-comparative (“diachronic”) and structuralist-synchronic approaches to language and sets them apart from all the precursor traditions is their explicitly descriptive orientation. Where the teacher instructs in how to use a language correctly (that is according to the educated standards prevalent in a community), where ordinary speakers react to linguistic difference primarily emotionally (“I just hate that New York City accent,” “all those Anglicisms are ruining the German language”), academic linguists generally do not pass value judgments on the linguistic forms and structures they are studying.

INTRODUCTION – LINGUISTIC AND OTHER APPROACHES TO LANGUAGE

1.2 Demonstration/discussion

Prescriptive and descriptive approaches to the study of language

In this section we will illustrate the contrast between various judgmental or “prescriptive” perspectives on language and the strictly descriptive take on linguistic phenomena which is the hallmark of academic linguistics. After the discussion of the examples, you will be able to more clearly understand the concerns of linguistics and distinguish them from other ways of analysing linguistic usage.
As a first illustration, consider the general American pronunciation of English, probably the most widely spoken and certainly the most widely heard accent in the world today. In comparison to British English, it is characterised by a number of well-established pronunciation features. Probably most salient among them is the fact that the <r> is pronounced wherever you find it in spelling (unlike British English, where <r> is silent if it follows a vowel). Thus, you hear an /r/ in the American pronunciation of words such as water, car or hard, whereas the <r> is silent in a British pronunciation. Also, the /t/ tends to be weakened in certain positions in American English, in particular between vowels if the first one is stressed (e. g. in words such as water or Betty). Trivial though these details of pronunciation may seem, they occasionally provoke strong negative reactions. Compare, for example, the following quotation from a letter written by American novelist Henry James (1843–1916):

Fig. 1.6 Henry James, novelist (1843–1916)

There are, you see, sounds of a mysterious and intrinsic meanness, and there are sounds of a mysterious intrinsic frankness and sweetness; and I think the recurrent note that I have indicated – fatherr and motherr and otherr, waterr and matterr and scatterr, harrd and barrd, parrt, starrt, and (dreadful to say) arrt (the repetition it is that drives home the ugliness), are signal specimens of what becomes of a custom of utterance out of which the principle of taste has dropped. (Henry James, “The Question of Our Speech,” in The Question of Our Speech/The Lesson of Balzac: Two Lectures. Boston and New York 1905: 29)
This is an interesting example of linguistic self-hatred, as the famous novelist Henry James was an American by birth (even though he died a naturalised British subject).
The next quotation is not from a famous individual of the past but taken from the present and the World-Wide Web. It was posted by an instructional designer with a British background and shows that some of the prejudice voiced by Henry James has survived:

How did the T become a D when in the middle of a word? I am a British lady and find this very annoying and hard to understand what was meant. For years I really thought that Nita Lowy’s name was spelt NEDA! How do the students manage in dictation (or don’t they have that in schools now). It affects everyone, as I just saw in print someone referring to Dr. Adkins, which would be the obvi-

DEMONSTRATION/DISCUSSION

ous spelling if one had only heard the word spoken and did not know that the correct spelling is Dr. Atkins. The sentence below gives an example of problems in understanding the spelling of certain words.
I am writing this as I hear it pronounced: Paddy and Neda attended the innerview and were congradulated on the recipe with the budder badder for the cake they cooked with their dada. (daughter). (source: http://www.linguistlist.org/~ask-ling/archive-most-recent/msg02452. html)
This statement provides an illustration of the slight animosity which educated British speakers sometimes feel towards American speechways, probably because – as the people who got the language going – they resent the political, economic and cultural pre-eminence of the United States in the world today.
What would descriptive linguists make of the statement by Henry James? The answer is simple. They would dismiss it as a completely unfounded and subjective value judgment. Even worse, some linguists might add, is the fact that this type of negative judgment on linguistic forms usually masks contempt for the speakers who use them. This, they would argue, is socially detrimental, as it is unfair to judge people not by what they do but by how they speak. Historical linguists might point out that among the people who pronounced the /r/-s in this way was one William Shakespeare (1564–1616). The r-less pronunciations of words such as father, mother or part arose only in the 18th century among the lower classes of London and then took some time to become the general British standard.
In the “British lady’s” pronouncement, the descriptive linguist would first point out that in the word congradulated as spelled here there is a mistake, because of course the stereotypical American would pronounce it as congraduladed. Whereas Henry James does not give any rational reasons for his dislike of the American accent, the British lady presents an argument: Americans do not distinguish between certain pairs of words, which makes their English difficult to understand and confusing. To this objection, the descriptive linguist would respond that for every instance in which two words are impossible to tell apart for accent reasons in American English there is at least one comparable case in British English. For example, the words source and sauce are clearly distinct in their pronunciation in American English but sound completely alike in British English. The reason, incidentally, is to be found precisely in the r-less pronunciation so much favoured by Henry James.
In real life, unlike constructed examples and jokes, the danger of misunderstandings resulting from the identical pronunciation of words with different meanings is, of course, minimal. If the topic of a conversation is urban problems in the United States and we hear inner city, we know from the context that we are talking about neglected city centres and do not even think of the

Different definitions of language

theoretical alternative inter-city. If in a conversation in Britain somebody says [sɔ:s] and the topic is food, we hear sauce, and not source.
What really might intrigue the descriptive linguist in the case of the American /t/ is the intricate set of rules which governs the weakening or “tapping”/“flapping” of the /t/. The latter terms are intended to capture the fact that in the American articulation of the sound the tip of the tongue just briefly taps or flaps against the palate (on which more will be said in Unit 2). As has been mentioned, such flapped or tapped /t/-s occur between vowels, but only if the first one is stressed. Thus we find them in Italy, but not in Italian, in atom (which sounds like Adam), but not in atomic, and so on. It occurs after /r/, as in dirty, hurting, and the /t/ disappears entirely after /n/, as in enter or centre, but again only if the syllable preceding the /t/ is stressed. This is why we would not get it in a word such as entire, which is stressed on the second syllable. Having been given so many clues, you can further hone your analytical skills as a budding descriptive linguist in Exercise 6 below.
Here, we shall return to the question raised at the very beginning – how to define language, the object of linguistic description. As has already been hinted at, it seems to be a much easier task to define linguistics than it is to define its object of study, human language and the diversity of languages – past and present – spoken in the world. To get a flavour of the diverse ways in which great thinkers in the field have approached the problem, consider the following proposals. Note that there is little overlap between the definitions, and that each emphasises a different aspect of the object to be defined:

Language is a purely human and non-instinctive method of communicating ideas, emotions, and desires by means of a system of volitionally produced symbols. (Edward Sapir, Language: An Introduction to the Study of Speech. New York 1921: 8)

From now on I will consider a language to be a set (finite or infinite) of sentences, each finite in length and constructed out of a finite set of elements. All natural languages in their spoken or written form are languages in this sense. […] Similarly, the set of ‘sentences’ of some formalized system of mathematics can be considered a language. (Noam Chomsky, Syntactic Structures. The Hague/Paris 1957: 13)

The essence of speech is that one human being, by movements beginning at his diaphragm and involving various parts of his chest, throat, mouth and nasal passages, creates disturbances in the air around him, which within a certain distance from him have a perceptible effect on the ear-drums and through them on the brains of other people, and that the hearers can, if they belong to the same language community, respond to these disturbances, or noises, and find them meaningful. (R. H. Robins, General Linguistics: An Introductory Survey. London 1971: 77)

DEMONSTRATION/DISCUSSION

Unit 1

After reading through the three definitions, one might well start wondering whether they actually target the same phenomenon. Sapir’s definition comes closest to our common-sense understanding; it emphasises the role of language as a tool for human communication, its symbolic character, and the fact that it is not an instinct or reflex but volitional and conscious. Chomsky’s definition, by contrast, is much more narrow and technical, drawing an analogy between the grammar of a language and a mathematical algorithm; nothing is implied about the role of language in society and communication. Robins, finally, approaches language through the sound of speech, emphasising the physical and acoustic sides of the phenomenon and disregarding grammatical function and content.
In view of these various emphases, it is probably not a mistake to have an amateur have the final say. The following definition is by the famous 19thcentury American poet and writer Walt Whitman (1819–1892):

Language is not an abstract construction of the learned, or of dictionary-makers, but is something arising out of the work, needs, ties, joys, affections, tastes, of long generations of humanity, and has its bases broad and low, close to the ground. (Walt Whitman, “Slang in America,” 1885)
Before going on with our defining work, let us pause to consider what it means to “know” a language. It certainly means to be able to speak it fluently and to communicate effectively. In addition, our linguistic intuition (“Sprachgefühl”) enables us to make finely grained judgments about nuances in meaning between alternative expressions or about the well-formedness of certain grammatical structures. Thus, an ordinary speaker of English knows with absolute certainty that both of the following sentences are possible utterances in his language:

Fig. 1.7 Walt Whitman (1819–1892)
Linguistic intuition and well-formedness

Inflation more than merely tripled between 1973 and 1983. Inflation will more than merely triple over the next 20 years.

A German speaker, by contrast, will accept only one of the structurally analogous sentences:

* Die Inflation mehr als nur verdreifachte sich zwischen 1973 und 1983. Die Inflation wird sich in den nächsten Jahren mehr als nur verdreifachen.

The *-sign is a widely used convention in linguistics. In synchronic linguistics it indicates that a construction or sentence is ungrammatical. In diachronic linguistics it signals that a form is assumed as a plausible reconstruction although direct evidence (for example in old texts) is missing.
Die Inflation verdreifachte sich zwischen 1973 und 1983, by itself, is a wellformed sentence. The problem thus is to find a place for the modification mehr als nur. The sentence given above does not work, and no amount of moving around the parts will make it work: *Die Inflation verdreifachte sich mehr als

nur, die Inflation mehr als verdreifachte sich nur, etc. On the other hand, any structure which has a form of verdreifachen in clause-final position is possible:

Die Inflation hat sich in den letzten Jahren mehr als nur verdreifacht. Ich weiß, dass sich die Inflation alle hundert Jahre mehr als nur verdreifacht.

The complexity of language
A working definition of language

This is a statement of the most important facts. At this stage in our introduction to linguistics we are not interested yet in a search for possible reasons. However, it is clear that the rules which are at work here are not those which are usually taught to foreign learners of English and German as part of their grammar teaching, nor are the sentences of the kind which children would practice massively in the early stages of natural language acquisition. In this sense, the example serves well to illustrate the enormous formal complexity of human languages.
This formal complexity is capable of expressing similarly complex meanings. While it is fairly easy to define the meaning of the verb triple (“increase threefold”), the combination more than triple raises a problem. Theoretically, this expression covers anything from “increase a little more than three-fold” to “increase a hundred-fold” and beyond. In a natural communicative situation, however, we are very likely to assume that we are talking about an increase which is between three-fold and four-fold. Why? The adverb merely, in its turn, introduces another nuance, namely that the increase was less than expected under the circumstances. In other words, it signals the speaker’s attitude towards the event reported.
After this exercise in consciousness-raising, we can now return to the initial question and name a number of features which must figure in any definition of language. Together they make up a good composite working definition of what a human language is.

1) New-born human beings have a genetic or natural predisposition to acquire a language (or languages) spoken in their communities. They are rather free to decide on what occasions and for what purposes they use language (which is an important contrast to many more instinct-based communication systems prevalent among animal populations).
2) Human languages represent meaning symbolically. The relationship between the sound of a word and the concept it denotes is thus arbitrary, as is easily shown by the following words used to denote the concept “bread”:

ekmek (Turkish), Brot (German), pane (Italian)

3) Words are combined into larger constructions by rules which are languagespecific conventions. German es wurde gesungen und getanzt expresses roughly the same idea as English there was singing and dancing. It is not possible to re-create the German structure in English or vice versa.

PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES

Unit 1

4) Human languages are sound-based. For a small number of the world’s c. 5,000 languages writing systems have been developed. Deaf people are capable of expressing themselves through signing.
While, as has been hinted at, several animal species have developed very complex systems of communication, the above-named features in their combination ensure that language is a uniquely human achievement. Animals may be able to communicate warnings or directions to their fellows, but only human beings use languages for complex reasoning, to talk about alternative worlds or possible behaviour, or to systematically lie and deceive.

Problems and challenges

1.3

In Section 1.2 above we had a look at how people developed negative attitudes towards particular ways of pronouncing the English language. Of course, this problem is not restricted to matters of pronunciation. Similar responses are occasionally aroused by grammatical constructions, as well. Again, the linguistic details in question are trivial, but the social consequences may be considerable. This section will introduce you to the use of computerised language corpora, i. e. textual data-bases which have been compiled for the purposes of linguistic research. Such corpora are a relatively recent innovation in linguistics. They are powerful tools, not the least of their advantages being that they allow students to gain hands-on research experience very early on in their coursework.
Consider the following extract from a play by the renowned British dramatist Tom Stoppard (b. 1937):

Corpora and the study of language

Max: […] if you don’t mind me saying so. Henry: My saying, Max.
Max gets up and wants to leave Henry: I’m sorry, but it actually hurts. (source: Tom Stoppard, The Real Thing. London 1983: 34)

Without going too deeply into the details of grammatical analysis at this stage, let us state the problem. Max uses the verb mind followed by a pronoun in the object form followed by the participle of the verb. In present-day English, there are numerous instances of this pattern: I found him reading, I caught them napping, etc. Henry resents the usage, insisting on a supposedly correct alternative: the verb mind, followed by a verbal noun (or gerund) which is modified by the possessive pronoun. Again, there are numerous instances of this pattern: I hate his singing, I am tired of your complaining, etc. Max is offended because his partner in conversation comments on the outer form of his utterance rather than the message. This is impolite. As the following examples show, the plain grammatical facts are somewhat in favour of Max. In

most cases, both variants are possible, and if only one works, it is in fact Max’s and not Henry’s:
She doesn’t mind his smoking during lunch. She doesn’t mind him smoking during lunch.
She doesn’t object to Peter’s smoking during lunch. She doesn’t object to Peter smoking during lunch.
?? Who would have dreamed of such a thing’s happening a year ago? Who would have dreamed of such a thing happening a year ago?
I can tell you that I’m not looking forward to this happening again. * I can tell you that I’m not looking forward to this’s happening again.
There just is no genitive or possessive case for the demonstrative pronoun this, and the genitive is a rather unusual choice for a noun denoting a lifeless object such as thing. In other cases, the contrast is neutralised, because a form such as her functions both as object case and as a possessive:
Nobody objects to her smoking after lunch.
It is in such instances of divided usage that corpora are useful. The British National Corpus (BNC) is an up-to-date database comprising the unbelievable amount of almost 100 million words of running text covering a wide variety of written and spoken genres (see Fig. 1.8).
Mark Davies, of Brigham Young University (Provo, UT, USA), makes this material available in a very user-friendly format at his BNC View homepage (http://corpus.byu.edu/bnc/). For the construction at issue here a search for “mind him” produces 35 hits, of which 14 illustrate the construction under study:
“Don’t you mind him stealing your father’s eggs?” Therefore I don’t mind him hearing the very worst about my past. She didn’t mind him telling her things, and learned very quickly. Diana, Barry’s wife of 35 years, doesn’t mind him meeting all the great screen goddesses. I wouldn’t mind him being Heathcliff ’s son, if only he loved her and could be a good husband to her.” If he did not know that, I do not mind him admitting it, but it is extraordinary ignorance on his part. I wouldn’t mind him sitting on top of my Christmas tree,” said either Dosh or Freddie. The Guardian also says Shearer twisted an ankle avoiding a lunge from Carl Bradshaw on Sat and may miss their game with Pompey on Wednesday, I wouldn’t mind him missing sundays game. Apparently, she did not mind him being a mop head when occupying other Government positions, but felt it would not be fitting for the role of Chancellor.

impossible, or is its absence from the British National Corpus accidental? This would be a question worth further corpus-based inquiry.
Another promising avenue of research would be to tabulate the origins of the various quotations. Are they from written texts – and hence formal? From spontaneous conversations – and hence informal? Systematic study will help us answer these questions – and others which will arise in the course of the work. At the end of our research, we will be in a position to offer a well-documented and comprehensive description of current usage.

2 Why did the instructional designer quoted in Section 1.2 above refer to herself as a British lady rather than a British woman or an Englishwoman? What are the differences in meaning between the words lady and woman in present-day English?
a) As a first step, note down your intuitions about – say – the contrast between Ask the lady over there and Ask the woman over there.
b) Discuss your intuitions with a native speaker of English and consult entries for woman and lady in a dictionary of your choice.
c) Collect a largish number of authentic uses of the two words from corpora and discuss the material.

3 To prove the point made above that knowledge of language history (diachrony) is irrelevant to the working of language as a structured system (synchrony), look up the words woman and lady in the Oxford English Dictionary (OED). This is the largest and most comprehensive dictionary ever produced for any language. It occupies almost two metres of shelf-space in its printed version, and is likely to be on hand in your departmental or university library. Alternatively, if your institution has a subscription, you may check the regularly updated online version (http://dictionary.oed.com/entrance.dtl). One special feature of the OED is that it charts the history of English words beginning with the first attested uses and through all subsequent expansions and changes of meaning. What do the entries for woman and lady say about the earliest meanings of the words? Is this knowledge useful in any way?

8 As you have worked hard, it is time for some relief. “What the writers say” is an occasional feature in this book highlighting some of the more bizarre and unexpected ways in which linguistics figures in English literature. The passage quoted below is from a novel by Anthony Burgess (1917–1993). Edwin is a professional linguist who all of a sudden finds himself in a psychiatric hospital and has to explain his job …

What the writers say
“Let’s sit down, shall we,” said Charlie, and Edwin, feeling that he was a bad host, led his visitors over to his bed. “Now,” said Charlie, “what is it your wife here says that you do?”
“Linguistics.” “Aha.” The three of them sat, leg-swinging, on the bed. “I’ve never heard of it,” said Charlie, “and that’s a fact. Mind you, I’m not saying that there’s no such thing, but no mention of it has ever come my way before.” “Oh,” said Edwin, “it does exist.” “That’s as may be, but, if it does exist, it’ll be above the heads of people like me and her.” He jerked his head towards Sheila. “Me, I clean windows. Anybody can understand what that is, and you don’t get put into places like this [the hospital ward] if you do a job like that. Mind you, you can get put into a hospital, if you’re a window-cleaner, but not into a hospital like this one, because windowcleaning doesn’t affect the brain.”

Phonetics and phonology – the sounds of speech

Orientation

2.1

Sounds and letters: the need for a phonetic alphabet

2.1.1

In the linguistic analysis of the sounds of spoken language, beginners usually have to make a conscious effort to break the mould of spelling, particularly in a language such as English, in which there is such an obvious discrepancy between orthography and pronunciation. Of course, there is a correspondence between letters, the graphic signs of writing, and the sounds articulated in pronunciation. For example, the letter <p> fairly regularly corresponds to a particular sound, and so do most other consonants (that is sounds which usually cannot form the nucleus of a syllable, see p. 29). However, there are irregularities even here in this simple case: for example, the <p> is silent in the words psychology or pneumonia. The correspondences between sound and spelling are much more complex for most vowels (that is sounds which usually form the nucleus of a syllable). For example, the words people, beat, seed and perceive all have the same vowel [i:], but it is spelled in four different ways. If two vowels are pronounced together, we have diphthongs. The correspondence between sound and spelling is similarly complex for English diphthongs. The three words pair, pare and pear, for example, have the same diphthong [εə], which however is spelled in three different ways depending on the meaning.
This list could easily be extended – and might culminate in asking whether fish could not equally well be written ghoti: gh as in laugh, o as in women, and ti as in nation (a witticism probably wrongly attributed to the famous dramatist and campaigner for spelling reform George Bernard Shaw (1856–1950)).
Clearly, before embarking on the serious study of speech sounds, we have to get rid of the complexities caused by the spelling system, which – in English as in most other languages with a long writing tradition – is the result of a historical evolution and often rather arbitrary when seen from a synchronic perspective. The problem was recognised by the pioneer phoneticians (a word derived from the Greek word for “sound” and describing linguists studying speech sounds) of the 19th century. To put the study of speech sounds on a firm footing, the International Phonetic Association (IPA), founded in 1886 and thus one of the oldest professional associations in linguistics, developed a phonetic alphabet designed to enable linguists to unambiguously transcribe the sounds of all human languages. Used in this sense, to transcribe means

PHONETICS AND PHONOLOGY – THE SOUNDS OF SPEECH

Vowels and consonants

not just to write but to really represent the spoken language on the written or printed page.
As has already been hinted at, the two major classes of speech sounds are vowels and consonants. In order to produce the different vowels, we position our speech organs in certain specified ways but we do not block the air-stream by causing friction or complete closure. If we block the air-stream in some way, the result is a consonant. The IPA transcription symbols for vowels and consonants are represented in Figures 2.2 and 2.3 respectively. Since this phonetic alphabet is designed to capture the sounds of all languages of the world, or all the possible speech sounds which human beings can produce, it contains many more symbols than the student of English has need for. Therefore, you need not be intimidated by the complexity of the symbols. To the extent that they are relevant for English, they will be explained in further detail below.

Fig. 2.2 IPA symbols for
vowels

In this diagram, [i] figures as a “close and front” vowel because it is articulated in the front of the mouth and with the front part of the tongue close to the palate. The vowel [ɑ], by contrast, is a “back and open” vowel because it is articulated at the back of the mouth, with the tongue lowered (more on these physiological details below).

consonants

ORIENTATION

Unit 2

To facilitate comprehension of this complex diagram, these are the consonants needed for the transcription of Standard British English. In addition to the IPA categories, the following Table also lists affricates, which occur when a plosive consonant, e. g. [t], merges with the fricative, e. g. [ʃ], produced in the same place of articulation.

plosives (or stops) affricates fricatives nasals other

p, b, t, d, k, tʃ, d f, v, θ, ð, s, z, ʃ, m, n, ŋ l, r, j, w, h

Table 2.1 List of English consonants

The terms appearing in the horizontal axis of the IPA chart (s. Fig. 2.3) – from “bilabial” to “glottal” – refer to the place of articulation, the terms appearing in the vertical axis – from “plosive” to “lateral approximant” – refer to the mode of articulation. They will be explained further below. The term pulmonic means that an air-stream exhaled from the lungs is involved in their production. This is the statistically normal case in all languages, and most languages in the world have only pulmonic consonants. (The best-known examples of non-pulmonic consonants are the click sounds of the South African Khoisan languages, for which the air-stream is started by a downward movement of the tongue. They have been popularised by South African singer Miriam Makeba’s “Click Song,” available from several web-sources, for example YouTube (http:// www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHxkiXALQjU).
Beginning students are frequently overwhelmed by the complexity of the phonetic alphabet and fail to see the relevance of this degree of detail for their studies. However, the connection to everyday life is real enough. Just pronounce the German word viel and use this pronunciation for the English word feel. You will immediately hear that it does not sound right, and the reason is simply that in German we have a clear or “palatal” [l], whereas in English in this position the [ ] is dark or velar. Similarly, you can pronounce the German loanword crashen the German way – as in das Auto ist in die Wand gecrasht –, and you see that a German [kr] sounds very different from an English one.

Sounds as sounds, and sounds as elements of linguistic systems:

from phonetics to phonology

The aim of phonetics is a precise description of the sounds of human languages from three perspectives:
– articulatory (how are they formed in the mouth, the glottis and the nasal cavity?)

PHONETICS AND PHONOLOGY – THE SOUNDS OF SPEECH

– acoustic (what are they like when measured while travelling through the air?), and
– auditory (how are they perceived by the listener?)
In phonetics, sounds are described for their own sake and in their own terms. Factors such as meaning and grammar are not relevant.
From among the three perspectives named in the above paragraph, it is the articulatory one that provides the most useful starting point. Figure 2.4 below represents the parts of the human body which play a role in the production of sounds.

The production of vowels

The single most important factor in the articulation of vowels is the position of the tongue in the mouth, schematically represented in the vowel quadrilateral shown in Figure 2.2 above. To properly “read” this figure, you imagine a cross section of a human mouth looking to the left, with the teeth and the lips being at the “front,” and the velum being at the “back.” In an open mouth, the tongue obviously occupies positions ranging from “close” to the palate to “open” (i. e. maximally lowered). This is why we distinguish front vowels from back vowels (depending on whether the front or the back of the tongue is involved in their articulation) and high (or close) vowels from low (or open) vowels (depending on whether the tongue is raised or not). The vowel [i], which – as can be seen – occupies the top left end of the quadrilateral, is a “front high” vowel because it is created by raising the tip of the tongue as high as possible.
Unlike consonants, where we can usually tell pretty clearly whether we have a [p] or a [t], transitions between the different vowels are smooth and gradual.

ORIENTATION

Unit 2

By convention and for better orientation, the most extreme or typical realisations of the various positions are referred to as cardinal vowels. For example, if we raise the front end of the tongue as high as possible, the result would be the cardinal vowel [i], which is in fact pretty close to the English long [i:] that we find in words such as beat and seed. The central vowel /ə/ requires least effort, because the mouth is relaxed and open, and the tongue remains in neutral position. This is why this particular vowel is very frequent in unstressed words and syllables. In the phrase for the painter, we would get it in [fə], [ðə] and the second syllable of painter ([peintə]). If we lower our tongue as far as possible, the result is “ah” ([ɑ]), which is why patients are encouraged to produce this sound for medical examinations in which the doctor wants to have a look “all the way down.” Diphthongs are produced by movements of the tongue from the starting point to the end point, for example from [ə] to [υ] in [əυ]. (Vowel sounds such as [υ] or [i:] which consist of just one element are also called monophthongs.)
Secondary factors which have an impact on vowel quality are lip rounding and nasality. The contrast between English earl and German Öl, for example, is due to the fact that this particular central long vowel [ :] is produced without lip-rounding in English but not in German. If the velum is lowered during articulation and a part of the air-stream thus allowed to escape through the nose, the result is a nasal vowel. Such nasal vowels are rare in English except in loanwords from languages such as French, which have them.
For consonants, the crucial three dimensions are:
– place of articulation (i. e. which parts of the mouth are involved in obstructing the air-stream)
– manner of articulation (i. e. is the obstruction total, that is a brief stop, or partial, that is some kind of friction), and
– voicing (i. e. do the vocal cords vibrate during articulation, as they do in voiced consonants or vowels, or do they not vibrate, as they do in voiceless consonants).

The production of consonants

With these hints it is now possible to return to the IPA symbols presented in Figure 2.3 above and read the diagram with an understanding of the principles underlying it. The possible places of articulation are given in anatomical order from left to right, as in the vowel quadrilateral, starting with the lips and ending with the glottis. A bilabial consonant is, thus, a consonant which is produced by some obstruction caused by both lips. A palatal consonant is produced by an obstruction caused by the tongue and the palate, and so forth. The various manners of articulation are listed from top to bottom, from the strongest to the weakest. Thus, “plosives” are produced by blocking the air-stream completely for a brief period. Fricatives are produced by partially obstructing the air-stream, and approximants, finally, are produced without audible friction. Just as the simple vowel quadrilateral in Figure 2.2 does not

represent diphthongs, the consonant chart does not indicate various types of “mixed” manners of articulation, such as the very common combination of a plosive and the corresponding fricative (as in [tʃ] or [d ]).
The phonetic approach to the sounds of speech raises an interesting problem. The more refined our instruments of analysis are, the more sounds we can distinguish. This is – satirically – pointed out in George Bernard Shaw’s play Pygmalion (first performed in 1913). Pygmalion is a mythical sculptor who is said to have carved the woman of his dreams in ivory and was rewarded for his labour by the Goddess Venus breathing life into the statue. This motif is transferred to contemporary England. In the play, it is Professor Higgins, practitioner of the then new science of sounds, who wants to transform the Cockney flower-girl Eliza Doolittle into his feminine ideal by training her to speak like a lady. This is bound to go hilariously wrong, as the change of accent does not go hand in hand with a change of Eliza’s sturdy East London proletarian attitudes. The play subsequently inspired a highly successful musical and movie (My Fair Lady). The character of Professor Higgins was apparently inspired by the real-life figure of Henry Sweet (1845–1912), pioneer linguist and phonetician.
Here is Prof. Higgins, talking to his associate Pickering:

Text 2.1 George Bernard Shaw, Pygmalion
(1913)

Prof. Higgins: Tired of listening to sounds? Pickering: Yes, it’s a fearful strain. I rather fancied myself because I can pro-
nounce twenty-four distinct vowel sounds, but your 130 beat me. I can’t hear the difference between most of them. Prof. Higgins: Oh, that comes with practice. You hear no difference at first; but you keep on listening, and presently … they’re all as different as A from B.

Important and less important attributes
of speech sounds

Higgins’ argument is convincing, but it nevertheless goes against a deep-seated intuition we have about sounds. If we ask a speaker of English how many sounds there are in his language, we won’t usually get a precise answer, but most people will settle on a figure in the range between 20 and 50. Claims that English or any other language might have 130 different vowels would be met with disbelief.
Let us explore this intuition on the basis of an example. A phonetic analysis of the English sound [k], for example, shows that there are several different realisations of this consonant in English words. As you can easily hear by speaking the words aloud, the [k] in cool or crude is rather different from the [k] in kiss. Putting the former into the place of the latter, or the other way round, makes the words sound funny indeed. By consulting the IPA chart, we can even pinpoint the source of this difference: it is largely a matter of the place of articulation. In front of a palatal or “front” vowel such as the [i] in kiss, the place of articulation of the [k] is pulled forward a little, to make articulation easier. In extreme cases, we might even think about

transcribing the result of this fronting by using the [c]-symbol of the IPA alphabet.
Coming back to our initial question – namely how many sounds there are in a language –, how can we reconcile such facts with our intuition that in spite of these differences in articulation there is just one k-sound in English? The solution to this apparent paradox requires a change of perspective – from phonetics, the self-contained study of speech sounds, to phonology, the study of speech sounds seen as basic units in a structural system.
In human languages, the basic function of sounds is to help us distinguish meanings. Which of the many possible contrasts between sounds are used for this purpose differs considerably across languages. The branch of linguistics concerned with the study of sounds as elements in such language-specific sound systems is called phonology. Any element in such a system which serves to distinguish between meanings is called a phoneme. To find out the phonemes of a particular language, we need to look for minimal pairs, pairs of words which differ in exactly one sound and in their meaning. The following minimal pairs, for example, show that the voiceless plosive consonants of English ([p],[t],[k]) are phonemes.

Table 2.2 Minimal pairs

Each pair of words conveys two distinct meanings, and each pair is distinguished by exactly one sound – no more and no less. Never mind how different the spellings are: write and right would not qualify as minimal pairs; they are different in meaning but pronounced exactly alike. Pack and bag are not minimal pairs, either; they are distinct in meaning but differ in two sounds rather than one.
The phonetically distinct kinds of [k] which we distinguished above will never show up in minimal pairs of this kind because, at least within the sound system of present-day English, they are in complementary distribution. That is: where one allophone (or realisational variant), for example, the back or velar one, occurs, the other one (in our case the front or palatal one) is ruled out. If we put a velar [k] into a palatal environment such as kin or kid, the result is a funny accent but never a confusion about meanings. This is not to say

PHONETICS AND PHONOLOGY – THE SOUNDS OF SPEECH

Phonetic and phonemic levels of
transcription

that such distinctions cannot be phonemic in languages other than English. Arabic, for instance, distinguishes between a velar /k/ and uvular /q/ plosive phoneme.
In the linguistic study of sounds it is therefore essential to make clear which level of description is intended. The following conventions are widely accepted in writing on phonetics and phonology (and have thus far been used in the present book without explicit explanation). Orthographic signs (or letters) are represented in angled brackets (e. g. <p>), sounds viewed as phonemes between slashes (/p/), and sounds viewed phonetically between square brackets ([p]). Phonemic or broad transcriptions confine themselves to the phonemically relevant contrasts and are therefore relatively simple to read. Phonetic or narrow transcriptions, by contrast, can be enriched with large amounts of detail and therefore often appear very complex by comparison. For example, the unitary English phoneme /t/ has several positional allophones varying in degree of aspiration. This comes out if we place narrow and broad transcriptions of the following words alongside each other:

tin [thin] neat [ni:t]

/tin/ /ni:t/

The raised little h in the narrow transcription of tin indicates that this sound is articulated with “aspiration,” that is a greater degree of force, at the beginning of a syllable but not at the end. You can test this easily by holding a sheet of paper in front of your lips and then pronouncing the two words tin and neat in succession. The paper should blow away when you pronounce tin, but not move after neat.
Similarly, /r/ is a phoneme in all varieties of English. However, its phonetic realisations and distribution differ across varieties. British English Received Pronunciation (R. P.) has [ɹ], American English a more retroflex (tip of the tongue curled backwards slightly), and Scottish English even has an apical or trilled [r].

2.1.3 Stress, pitch, intonation – phonetics and phonology beyond the individual sound

Phonotactics – which sounds can combine
with which others?

So far the discussion in this Unit has centred on individual speech sounds, which have been approached either from a phonetic or from a phonological perspective. But even an introduction must at least briefly mention the supra-segmental domain, that is all those many interesting phenomena which extend beyond the single segment in the sound chain.
The sounds of a language do not occur in any possible sequence or combination. There are clear language-specific constraints that regulate which sounds can occur in which position in the word or syllable. The study of such constraints is the domain of phonotactics. For example, an initial cluster of

Unit 2

/ʃn/ is a common occurrence in German (Schneider, Schnitzel, schnell, …), but most unusual in English. The reverse holds for /sn/ (as in sneak, snail, snow, …).
Languages differ considerably with regard to which syllable structures they allow or prefer. If we use the symbol C to refer to any consonant, and V to refer to any vowel or diphthong, the structure of the very simple syllable go could be represented as CV. Compared to many other languages in the world, English allows very complex clusterings of consonants syllable-initially and finally – for example syllables of the abstract pattern CCCVCCC or, if we allow grammatical endings such as the plural s, even CCCVCCCC, as in strengths. However, the type of consonant admissible in such clusters and the order in which they are arranged is severely restricted. While the syllable-initial sequence /str-/ is common, /tsr-/ or /rts-/ are not.
Another important supra-segmental phenomenon is word stress. Every English word of more than one syllable has at least one main stress, indicated by in the transcription. The word graphical, for instance, has a stressed first syllable and two unstressed syllables following it: [ ræfik(ə)l].
The word photograph, on the other hand, has a stressed syllable at the beginning but the last syllable is not entirely unstressed: it bears a secondary stress, indicated in the transcription by [ fəυtə rɑ:f].
The placement of word stress in present-day English is extremely complicated. Owing to a history of extensive language contact, the English language contains elements of three partially incompatible stress systems today, a Germanic one which usually favours stress on the root syllable (in practice often the initial syllable), a French one which calls for accent on the final syllable (de scend), and one influenced by the movable stress of Latin and Greek (e. g. photograph, pho tographer, photo graphical). Note that over time many borrowed words from French and the classical languages have adopted “Germanic” initial stress (e. g. nature, category), and some are variable (e. g. address, garage).
In addition to word-stress, there is, of course, also sentence stress. Sentence stress is best treated together with intonation as both interact in highlighting important content in an utterance. In spite of its immense importance to the spoken language, linguists have not yet been able to agree on a generally accepted notational system comparable to the IPA symbols used for the individual sound segments. But in principle the basic intonational unit is structured around a stressed nucleus on which a pitch movement occurs (spelled in capitals in the following example), a pre-nuclear onset, and a coda. In the most neutral reading of the following sentence, friend is the nucleus, showing a falling intonation, he’s your is the onset and then the coda:

In an appropriate context, for example if we want to emphasise that the person in question is your friend rather than someone else’s, the nucleus can, of course, shift back to your, and friend then together will be the coda.

he’s onset

YOUR nucleus

friend then coda

Full and weak forms Assimilation

In yet another context, even the very first word of the tone-group might receive stress: HE’s your friend then.
Note in this connection that words such as articles, prepositions, conjunctions and pronouns (i. e. all words which have primarily grammatical function) are usually unstressed in connected speech. Our example contains two relevant items – the auxiliary verb is and the possessive pronoun your. In our example, the word is, which would be pronounced [iz] in isolation, is reduced to [z]. Other possible reduced pronunciations encountered in connected speech are [s] (after voiceless consonants) or [əz]. Your is pronounced as [jυə] or [jɔ:] in isolation in British English. The most common American pronunciation is [jɔr]. These are also the pronunciations which will be used in connected speech, if the word is stressed. In other instances, however, [jə] would be expected. The reduced pronunciations of such grammatical words are also known as weak forms. Many of them contain the vowel [ə], which also happens to be the only English vowel which does not occur in stressed syllables.
A final phenomenon worth mentioning on the supra-segmental level is assimilation, the influence exercised by one sound on the articulation of another one occurring in close proximity. This is also a phenomenon characteristic of rapid and colloquial speech. Our example he’s your friend, for instance, might be pronounced as [hi ə frend], with the two separate segments [z] and [j] merging into [ ]. As the IPA chart in Fig. 2.3 shows, the postalveolar fricative [ ] is a good compromise between the alveolar [z] and the palatal [j].

DEMONSTRATION/DISCUSSION

Unit 2

in any undergraduate course in English. First, accent and pronunciation are what distinguishes speakers of different varieties of English most comprehensively and far more systematically than lexical or grammatical peculiarities. The phonetic characteristics of the major varieties of English will therefore feature prominently in the relevant portions of Unit 11. Secondly, accent, or more precisely a foreign accent, is also a major problem at all levels of competence in foreign language learning. Of course studying a contrastive description of the sound systems of English and German will not make a student learner’s accent go away, but it is a helpful first step in diagnosing one’s level of competence and in raising one’s awareness about what still remains to be practiced. For the language teacher, an understanding of the linguistic mechanisms responsible for a foreign accent is helpful for designing appropriate teaching materials and strategies for various groups of learners.
In this spirit, consider the following list of the phonemes of English (British Received Pronunciation = R. P.) and German. Here are the consonantal phonemes, represented by their IPA symbols except for the German palatalvelar fricative – <ch> in spelling –, which is not represented by a unitary symbol but by its two positional allophones commonly known as “ich-Laut” and “ach-Laut”:

For the consonants, the situation is identical in American English at the phonemic level. Phonetically, we would need an extra symbol for the ‘flapped’ realisation of the /t/ phoneme as [ſ] (as in bitter). For the rather more serious contrasts in the vowel and diphthong phonemes see Exercise 2 below.
What are the major learning difficulties faced by a speaker of German when trying to master the new phonemic system of English? At the risk of some simplification, there are three types of obstacles:

1) Phonemic gaps

Consonants Vowels

As the lists show clearly, there are phonemes in English which are absent from German. Among the consonants, the most obvious cases are the dental fricatives ([θ, ð]) and the semi-vowel [w]. What beginning German-speaking learners will do is to substitute what they consider the closest German equivalent to the English sound. For the voiceless dental fricative this is usually either [s] or the labio-dental fricative [f]. However, as is shown by minimal pairs such as sink – think or thought – fought, this is not a suitable strategy. For English [w], a common substitution is [v], so that learners might pronounce [wiliəm] as [viliəm], using the same sound which occurs in the German name Wilhelm. Substitution is made even easier by the fact that the same letter – <w> – is used to denote the different sounds in the two languages.
For the vowels, the comparison between English and German shows several contrasts. For example, there are more phonemic front vowel distinctions in English than in German, and this leads to learners of English often col-

DEMONSTRATION/DISCUSSION

Unit 2

lapsing the distinction between [e] and [æ] by articulating both in the same way – roughly as German [ε]. Minimal pairs such as bet – bat or celery – salary are then no longer kept distinct.

2) Distributional constraints

Even if a particular phonemic contrast is present both in the English and German systems, there may still be pronunciation problems because the rules for the distribution of the phonemes in the syllable are different. Consider, for example, the distinction between voiced and voiceless <s>. This is a phonemic contrast both in English and German, as is easily apparent from minimal pairs such as the following:

rice – rise racing – raising sink – zinc

heißer – heiser

Note, however, that while in English the opposition is found syllable-initially, medially and finally, in German it is restricted to medial position. Whether in German we pronounce a word such as Sonne with a voiced [z] or a voiceless [s] largely depends on our regional background: initial [z] is found in the North and recommended in the standard pronunciation; initial [s] tends to be preferred in the South. In syllable- or word-final position, German only has [s]: Haus (but compare Häuser, with [z]), Glas (but compare Gläser, with [z]). It is therefore particularly difficult for beginning German learners of English to articulate [z] in syllable-final position in English words. This will lead to a noticeable accent, as some of the most common words in English (e. g. has, is, does) happen to end in [z].
The problem of final devoicing (or “Auslautverhärtung”) is not restricted to <s> but encompasses all fricatives, affricates and plosives. Any of the following English minimal pairs are thus potential problems for German learners:

Syllable-final devoicing

cap – cab right – ride leak – league

leaf – leave teeth – teethe rich – ridge

In all, final devoicing, or the neutralisation of the voicing contrast in syllablefinal position, in German learner English is thus probably the most massive single contributing factor to this particular foreign accent.

3) Contrasts in the allophonic realisations of phonemes
Sometimes there is no contrast between the two languages at the phonemic level, but nevertheless the auditory impression is rather different. This affects the consonant /l/, for example. German /l/ is “clear” in all cases. That means it has a front vowel resonance. In British English, this clear [l] is found only

PHONETICS AND PHONOLOGY – THE SOUNDS OF SPEECH

Word-stress

word-initially and between vowels. Before consonants or at the end of words, the /l/ is “dark” [ ] because it has a back vowel resonance. In most varieties of American English, velar or “dark” /l/ is the common realisation in all phonetic environments. Thus, the phonemic or “broad” transcription of German fiel and English feel is identical: /fi:l/. However, the phonetic or “narrow” transcription is [fi:l] for German and [fi: ] for English.
In addition to these three sources of error, there are of course numerous further difficulties at the supra-segmental level. Foremost among them is probably the highly intransparent word-stress system of present-day English. For example, there is no logic behind the fact that apple-cake is pronounced with a stress on the first element (like the German Apfelkuchen), whereas apple-pie generally has level stress (that is equal stress on both elements). Similarly, there are so many polysyllabic words in English which have their stress on the “antepenultimate” (= third syllable counted from the end) – co rollary, peni tentiary, etc. – that it is difficult to see why category should not be in this class and be pronounced as ca tegory. (The correct pronunciation is, of course, category, with the stress on the first syllable.)

2.3 Problems and challenges

PRAAT – doing phonetics by computer


The “problems and challenges” sections of the present introduction are usually constructed around some corpus-based task. As most widely available corpora of present-day English reduce the live complexity of speech to orthographic transcription, this procedure is difficult to follow here. Instead, readers are encouraged to explore the opportunities for computer-aided work in phonetics, for example through PRAAT, a software suite developed by Paul Boersma and David Weenink of the University of Amsterdam (http://www.fon.hum. uva.nl/praat/).
The problem chosen for illustration here is the pronunciation of the diphthong [ai] in Canadian English. Whereas speakers of British or American English have broadly the same diphthong realisation in white and wide (that is before a voiceless and a voiced following plosive), many Canadians have [əi] in white and [ai] in wide. This is important, and many people are aware of it, because it is one of the very few phonetic characteristics distinguishing a Canadian accent from a United States one. In linguistic field-work, it is of course possible to consult informants in a purely auditory analysis. The linguist listens carefully to what he or she hears and transcribes accordingly. With PRAAT, however, it is possible to subject the recorded data to instrumentalphonetic analysis. The screenshot below shows you what a diphthong looks like in this perspective. (If you have the opportunity, you may want to consult the accompanying web-page for this book in order to get it in full colour.)

PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES

Unit 2

Fig. 2.6 PRAAT – illustrative screenshot “white” (screenshot and explanatory text kindly provided by Ingrid Rosenfelder, University of Freiburg)

The screenshot shows a so-called Text Grid Editor window, which displays a sound file together with its corresponding TextGrid. This is basically a text file containing annotation text in combination with time information from the sound file. A TextGrid consists of one or several tiers, which appear as rows below the speech waveform, and into which information can be entered. This can be very useful for research, as it allows you to mark the phonemes (or any other phenomenon) that you are interested in analysing, add your own comments or background information, and easily retrieve all instances thus marked.
What you can see in this window is the realisation of the diphthong /ai/ in the word white, as pronounced by a speaker of Canadian English. Time is running along the x-axis, or from left to right, and is indicated in seconds. A portion of the sound file corresponding to the interior part of the diphthong /ai/ has been shaded dark. In the upper window, the speech waveform is displayed, i. e. the varying air pressure that has “hit” the membrane of the microphone during the recording. The lower window shows a spectrogram, which indicates the frequencies that the waveform is made up of at a certain point of time, with darker shading indicating higher intensities of the frequency components in question. Frequencies range from 0 to 5,000 Hertz and are displayed along the y-axis (i. e. from bottom to top) of the spectrogram.
Underneath the spectrogram, the various tiers of the TextGrid are shown, together with their names on the right-hand side. Note that boundaries (solid vertical lines) have been inserted into these tiers to demarcate the extent of the diphthong, and that information about the sound in question (phoneme: /ai/,

first tier; word: white, second tier) has been entered. The last two tiers (without any boundaries) contain information about the speaker, namely speaker ID and speaker sex.
Superimposed on the spectrogram are a number of dots, which show the location of the vowel formants. These are the resonance frequencies of the vocal tract, and the first and second formant correspond roughly to the highlow and front-back dimensions of the vowel quadrilateral, respectively, with higher vowels having a lower first formant (F1) and fronter vowels a higher second formant (F2). Note that all formants are located along the darkest areas of the spectrogram, i. e. they belong to those frequency ranges that contribute the most to the intensity of the overall sound.
As you can see, the first two formants are very far apart at the end (offglide) of the diphthong /ai/, the first formant having a very low, the second formant a very high value. This means that the vowel at that point of time is both high (low F1) and front (high F2), which of course agrees with the position of the sound [i] in the vowel quadrilateral. At the beginning (onset) of the diphthong, F1 is higher, and F2 considerably lower. This corresponds to a lower and backer onset, [ə] in this case, because of the special Canadian pronunciation noted above. (The phenomenon demonstrated here is commonly called “Canadian Raising,” because the onset of the diphthong is “raised” from [a] to [ə].) Also, note the large blank area to the right of the diphthong. This is the closure phase of the following plosive /t/, during which the air stream is blocked completely and no sound is emitted from the vocal tract.
Had this diphthong been pronounced by a speaker of British or American English, or had the diphthong been followed by a voiced instead of a voiceless

PRACTICE

Unit 2

consonant, the onset of the diphthong would not have been raised. Thus, the first formant (F1) would have been higher at the beginning of the highlighted area. Using acoustic analysis techniques allows researchers to assign precise measurement values to statements like these. Each dot in the spectrogram above corresponds to exactly one formant measurement (e. g. F1 = 563 Hz at the beginning of the diphthong). This makes it possible to more accurately compare vowel realisations, for example, by plotting formant trajectories in F1/F2 space, as in Fig. 2.7, which shows the diphthong realisations in white (raised) and sigh (unraised).

Morphology and word-formation – the structure of the word

Orientation

3.1

Free and bound morphemes

3.1.1

While speakers of a language are not usually aware of the complexities of the phonological system of their language, everybody has a common-sense notion of what a “word” is. If asked, speakers of English, for example, would in all likelihood agree that in spite of the considerable differences all of the following qualify as words:

“Word” – problems of definition

she, look, looking, onlooker, type, write, typewriter, (to) type-write

This common-sense understanding of what a word is may suffice for practical purposes. It is not sufficient, however, for the purposes of linguistic analysis. Consider just some of many more problems that we would have to solve:

Phonetic contractions: Is the form I’m, contracted from I am, one word or two? The same question could be asked for don’t, gonna – a common colloquial pronunciation of going to, and hundreds of similar cases.

Sequences of nouns: Sequences of nouns can be of three kinds. (1) They can be spelled as one unit (e. g. nutshell), in which case it is uncontroversial to accept them as words. (2) They can be spelled with a hyphen (e. g. apple-pie), in which case there are also good grounds for considering them as words. (3) They can be spelled separately, and these are of course the difficult cases to classify.
Does the expression London broker consist of two words, because the meaning of the entire phrase is the exact sum of the meaning of its parts, i. e. a broker based in or coming from London? Then what about insurance broker, which incidentally would be translated as one word in German (Versicherungsmakler)?

Variable spellings: The spelling of many complex words in English is notoriously variable. The noun-noun sequences discussed above are one example. Some of them are found in all three possible variants: as motorcar and wordformation, as motor-car and word-formation, and as motor car and word formation.

To get out of such dilemmas, linguists studying the structure of words have created a precisely defined technical term, the morpheme. In analogy to the term phoneme (= smallest linguistic unit capable of distinguishing between meanings), the word morpheme refers to the minimal unit capable of express-

MORPHOLOGY AND WORD-FORMATION – THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORD

Free and bound morphemes

ing a meaning of its own. Metaphorically speaking, we could refer to morphemes as atoms of meaning.
By notational convention, a morpheme is placed between braces ({}). Thus the graphic word <high> consists of the morpheme {high}, while the graphic word <higher> is a combination of the morpheme {high}, which provides the specific word meaning, and the morpheme {-er}. The meaning of this morpheme is more difficult to specify than that of the word <high> because it is more general, expressing a greater degree or, to use the technical term for this grammatical category, the comparative form of adjectives.
This example already makes it clear that we need to distinguish between various types of morphemes. There are morphemes such as {high} which are “free” in the sense that they can stand on their own, and there are “bound” morphemes such as {-er}, which require a free morpheme to attach to. The free morpheme which the bound morpheme attaches to is commonly referred to as the base. Bound morphemes are also called affixes. The following list illustrates some common bound morphemes of English:

Table 3.1 Bound morphemes

bound morpheme {-s}

{-ed} {un-}

{-ness} {-er}

examples two dogs, toys
looked, desired, played untie, undo, unhappy, unpleasant
happiness, tiredness Londoner, New Zealander, New Yorker

function
turns nouns from singular to plural turns verb into past tense
“negative” morpheme: denotes the reversal of an action if used with verbs, and the opposite quality if used with adjectives turns adjectives into nouns
denotes inhabitant of a city, region or country

Inflectional and deri- Bound morphemes chiefly serve two functions – an inflectional one and a vational morphemes derivational one:
1) A bound morpheme is inflectional if it gives us information about how the word is used in a phrase or a sentence. To return to our initial example higher: if we have this form of the word, we know that we can continue the sentence with than (e. g. prices are higher than last year).
2) A bound morpheme is derivational in function if it helps speakers to derive or create new words from an existing base, for example the word highness from high. (In addition, there is another form, height, which is the result of a highly irregular process of derivation.)

ORIENTATION

Unit 3

An easy test to distinguish between inflectional and derivational processes is to look up forms in a dictionary. Dictionaries usually list the products of derivation as separate entries, but not the inflectional forms of one and the same word.

Fig. 3.1 Types of morphemes I

{high}

inflectional {high} {-er}

derivational {high} {-ness}

Apart from the comparative morpheme already illustrated, typical inflectional morphemes of present-day English are the 3rd-person-singular {-s} in the present tense, the {-ed} marking past tense, or the plural {-s} in nouns. The derivational morphemes of present-day English number in the hundreds and illustrate various degrees of regularity and productivity. The most important of them will be discussed below.
Note that form-function mapping in morphology is very often rather complex. Rarely do we have a situation where one bound morpheme performs exactly one function. The {-er} which we illustrated in its function of an inflectional morpheme indicating comparative (e. g. high → higher) also serves as a derivational one, used to turn verbs into agentive nouns indicating the person or thing which performs an activity denoted by the verb (to bake → baker, to compute → computer). But this is not the only derivational process this morpheme is involved in. As examples such as London → Londoner show, it also denotes inhabitants of a place, and in a few irregular cases such as old-timer (somebody, especially an elderly person, with long experience in a place or position) the meaning is even more general.
Just as one and the same phoneme may have several contextually conditioned allophonic realisations, so one and the same morpheme may have different allomorphs, that is realisational variants. Thus, the {-s} indicating plural or genitive in nouns or third-person singular of the present tense in verbs comes in three different phonetic realisations: [s], [z], [iz]. The voiceless s is used after all voiceless consonants except [s, ʃ, tʃ]. It would be found, for example, in cats, beliefs or baths. The voiced s occurs after vowels and voiced consonants except [z, , d ] – for example in boys, girls or bathes; and the syllabic [iz] is found after [s, z, ʃ, , tʃ, d ] – for example in races, buzzes, washes,

watches or judges. Similar allomorphy can be observed in derivation. The derivational morpheme {-tion}, for example, which turns verbs into nouns, has two allomorphs: [eiʃn] and [ʃn], as can be seen in the following examples:

to detain → detention to retain → retention to realise → realisation to organise → organisation

Productivity of morphological
processes

Bound morphemes are also highly variable with regard to their productivity. The regular inflectional morphemes are in principle fully productive. For example, the plural {-s} attaches to any noun except a very small number of exceptions. Some of these are historical fossils. For example, the plural of ox, foot or mouse is not, as would be expected *oxes, *foots or *mouses, but oxen, feet and mice – older forms which, unlike hundreds of others, have so far refused to die out by regularisation. Other exceptions are more difficult to explain. It is difficult to see, for example, why English speakers do not accept nouns such as information or advice in the plural (*informations, *advices).
There are vast differences in the degree of productivity displayed by derivational morphemes. At the lowest end of the cline of productivity, there are forms which are recognisable as transparent instances of derivation, but we cannot use these morphemes to derive any new words today. This is the case, for example, with the {-th} morpheme, which is occasionally encountered in English as a derivational morpheme turning adjectives into abstract nouns:

warm → warmth wide → width merry → mirth foul → filth

Note, for example, that [faυl] becomes [fil-] in [filθ]. This irregularity is due to the fact that this pair were related by umlaut (or i-mutation) in Old English, much like faul and Fäulnis still are in present-day German. The stock of such forms is limited to these and a few more (e. g. length, strength, dearth). But new ones cannot be added. Thus, we are unlikely to encounter:

clean → * cleanth round → * roundth

At the other end of the cline of productivity, there are derivational morphemes whose productivity approaches that of inflectional ones, for example the morpheme {-ness}, which does the same job as {-th}, albeit far more readily, and with none of the phonetic complications which are found in most examples containing {-th}.

ORIENTATION

Unit 3

happy

→ happiness

concrete

→ concreteness

interconnected → interconnectedness

busy

→ business [bizines] …

Note that the last-named example illustrates the productive and regular derivational process. Business, in the pronunciation given, is the noun corresponding to the adjective busy and means “Geschäftigkeit” in German. Business, in the pronunciation [biznis] and meaning “Geschäft,” though originally due to the same process, has by now established itself as a separate word through a process of lexicalisation.
In lexicalisation, the meanings of words are specified by convention beyond that which is predictable from the regular and productive derivational process. The regular form [bizinis] is not lexicalised to any great extent, and its meaning is very close to what can be predicted on the basis of what we know about the meanings of the base form busy and the derivational morpheme {-ness}; it could be paraphrased as “the quality of being busy.”
Similarly, the {-er} morpheme, when added to verbs, in very general terms denotes the “person or thing performing an activity.” The fact that we “know” that a baker is a person, but a cooker an object is due to lexicalisation. For further examples of lexicalisation see Task 4 below.

Lexicalisation

Lexical and grammatical morphemes

3.1.2

Above, we have classified morphemes by a simple formal criterion – whether or not they can appear on their own. Another way of classifying morphemes (and words) is by function and meaning. For this, we need to determine whether they have a concrete and specific lexical or a more abstract and general grammatical meaning. There is an obvious correlation between the two classification schemes employed so far. Most free morphemes (formal criterion) are also lexical (function-meaning criterion), and vice versa: table, rapid, happy, sit, etc. Many bound morphemes perform grammatical functions, and many grammatical functions are performed by bound morphemes: {-s}, {-ed}, etc.
However, the correlation is not perfect. In English there is a considerable number of free morphemes with grammatical rather than lexical function. In the following utterance:

Free grammatical morphemes

Not in the kitchens!

only kitchen is a lexical morpheme in that sense. {-s} is a bound morpheme which expresses the inflectional notion of “plural.” Not, in and the are free morphemes, but the meanings they express are akin to those expressed by bound derivational and inflectional morphemes – in this case the generalised notions of “negation,” “locality” and “definiteness.” While the slot:

Not in the kitchen! Not in the kitchen! Not in the kitchen!

In the kitchen! Not into/out of/above … the kitchen! Not in a/some/this … kitchen!

Bound lexical morphemes

We can thus see that in present-day English grammatical relations are not only expressed by bound morphemes but that this job is done also by a number of free ones (as is typical of languages of the analytical type – a concept which will be explained in Unit 4).
Just as there are free morphemes with grammatical function, there are bound morphemes with lexical status. For example, English has a large group of neo-classical compounds, words formed from Greek or Latin elements in the modern European languages. The following are typical examples: photography, radiography, thermography.
The second element ({-graphy}) in each of these examples goes back to the ancient Greek root for “write,” whereas the first elements ({photo-}, {radio-}, {thermo-}) go back to the Greek for “light,” “ray” and “heat” respectively. The compounds thus have the concrete and specific meanings of “light-writing” (= writing with light), “X-ray writing” and “heat-writing.” Nevertheless, neither of the four elements involved can stand on its own in the relevant sense. Graphy and thermo do not occur except as elements in such neo-classical compounds. Photo and radio, by contrast, are attested as lexical morphemes, but of course not in the senses relevant here.

3.2 Demonstration/discussion: The major word formation strategies of present-day English

The creation of new words

In this section we shall have a look at the strategies which are available in present-day English to coin new words. Note that one possible strategy, namely to create new words by assembling sounds, is an option which is exercised only very rarely. A recent (20th-century) example is the noun/verb vroom, also spelled varoom, which echoes the roaring sound of an engine and is also used to refer to reckless and speedy driving. In a way the relative scarcity of such

DEMONSTRATION/DISCUSSION

Unit 3

examples is surprising, because there are countless phonotactically possible combinations in English which have not been used yet.
The vast majority of new words is thus formed by modifying existing ones. Thereby, it is useful to distinguish between major strategies which account for large numbers of words and minor ones, which are not necessarily very frequent or general but interesting because of the linguistic creativity they imply. The three major processes used in English are compounding, derivation and conversion.

Major word-formation processes

Compounding

A compound is a combination of at least two free morphemes. Compounding has been a mainstay of the English word-formation system since Old English times, with the most common case being noun + noun compounds of the modifier-head type.

Compounding

apple pie street lamp motor vehicle accident

In apple pie, pie is the head, modified by apple. The head can be modified by numerous other modifiers, for example cherry pie, pecan pie or pumpkin pie. Similarly a street lamp is a kind of lamp, and a motor vehicle accident is a kind of accident. Note that in the latter example motor vehicle, the modifier of accident, is itself a compound, with vehicle as its head and motor as its modifier. In contrast to German, spelling is not a reliable indicator of compound status in English.
Apart from noun + noun compounds there are numerous other types, which however tend to be much rarer. Here are some examples:

adjective + noun: adjective + adjective: noun + adjective: verb + noun: verb + verb:

blackboard, medical student blue-green power-hungry, power-crazy, trigger-happy pickpocket to kick-start, to stir-fry

As far as the relationship between the component parts of compounds is concerned, most of them display the familiar modifier-head structure. A medical student is a student in the field of medicine and not another one. A power-crazy individual is crazy about power and not some other pursuit. However, bluegreen and stir-fry are different, as none of the two components modifies or is subordinate to the other. Blue-green denotes a colour combining blue and green in equal measure, and to stir-fry means stirring and frying food simultaneously. Modifier-head compounds are often referred to as endocentric compounds; this latter type, on the other hand, is also known as copulative compounds.

skills? (Left hand) (writing skills)? Left (hand writing skills)?

Pickpocket, finally, illustrates a third (and rare) type, namely exocentric compounds. None of the component parts of this compound refers to the referent directly. A pickpocket is not a type of pocket, nor is the corresponding verb to pickpocket a type of picking (as would be the case in pocketpicking). Rather, the compound refers to a person who picks other people’s pockets (“Taschendieb”).

Derivation

Derivation

Derivation involves combinations of at least one free morpheme and at least one bound morpheme whose function is not inflectional. The following are examples: unhappy, happiness density, electricity, audacity, monstrosity establishment, disestablishment, anti-disestablishmentarian

Sometimes it is useful to distinguish derivational morphemes with regard to their position in the word. If the derivational morpheme precedes the base, it is a prefix; if it follows the base, it is a suffix. (Infixation, that is the placing of a suffix inside the base, is largely restricted to swearing: absolutely → absobloody-lutely.)
Most prefixes preserve word-class. Thus, both happy and unhappy are adjectives, and both establishment and disestablishment are nouns. Most suffixes, on the other hand, change the word class, for example from adjective to noun, as in happy → happiness. In word-formation more so than in other branches of linguistics, there are, of course, exceptions. In careerism, suffixation turns a concrete noun into an abstract one, and in befriend the prefix be- turns a noun into a verb.
Compounding and derivation can easily be combined. The word userfriendly, for example, is a compound made up of a noun and an adjective which are both complex internally (use → user, friend → friendly). If there are several suffixes attaching to one root, their order is usually not free, and the number of possible combinations is restricted. Thus, as our list shows, the derivational morpheme {-ity} clearly favours roots of Romance and Latin origin (e. g. scarcity, magnanimity, etc.). *Happity is not possible. The functionally similar {-ness} does not display a corresponding constraint: denseness is normal, and monstrousness or audaciousness are plausible words of English.

DEMONSTRATION/DISCUSSION

Unit 3

Also note another important contrast between these two derivational morphemes. Whereas the Germanic suffix {-ness} attaches to its root without any phonetic complications, this is only exceptionally so in the case of {-ity}. If the root has more than one syllable, the stress shifts to the ante-penultimate (third from the back) syllable ( monstrous → mon strosity), unless it happens to be there already (au dacious → au dacity). But even in the latter case, the pronunciation of the adjective differs considerably from the noun: [ɒ deiʃəs] vs. [ɒ d siti].

Conversion

Conversion is the creation of a new word without any formal or external change to the base. Here are a few examples, starting with the most common type, noun-to-verb conversion, and then moving on to some slightly more unusual examples:

Conversion

source word bottle carpet partition
car-pool down
up narrow
heavy
up

type of conversion noun to verb

converted word to bottle

noun to verb

to carpet

noun to verb

to partition

noun to verb adverb to verb

to car-pool to down

preposition to verb

to up

adjective to verb

to narrow

example

I had the whole house re-carpeted.
You can get a spare room if you partition one of the bigger ones.
We took turns car-pooling the kids to school.
Workers at the factory downed tools in protest last night.
They kept upping the price.
How can we narrow the gap between rich and poor?
The door was guarded by a pair of heavies with a threatening look on their faces.
No doubt there have been ups and downs in this relationship.

MORPHOLOGY AND WORD-FORMATION – THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORD

This process, extremely productive in present-day English, is also referred to as “zero-derivation” or “syntactic homonymy.” The term zero-derivation suggests that such instances of conversion should be regarded as a borderline case of derivation, namely derivation by a zero-morpheme {ø}. The term syntactic homonymy emphasises that the part-of-speech class of many English words is not clear out of context and emerges only when the word is used in a particular grammatical or syntactic environment. This is the best way of accounting for cases such as love (noun and verb) where it is not clear which of the two is the primary form and which is the converted or derived one. The reason for this uncertainty is that such cases usually go back to pairs of words which were kept distinct by inflectional endings in older stages of the English language. In our example, the noun was lufu in Old English, and the verb lufian, and the two forms collapsed into one after the loss of inflectional endings.
Some word-formation processes which at first look very much like conversion do not fully meet the criteria on closer inspection. For example, there is a pattern of the following type:

to object (verb) to import to record

object (noun) import record

Note, however, that in each case the verb has the stress on the second syllable, whereas the noun has it on the first:

/tυ əb d ekt/ /tυ im pɔ:t/ /tə ri kɔ:d/

/ ɒbd əkt/ / impət/ / rekəd/

A similar case of borderline conversion is represented by examples in which the nouns end in a voiceless consonant, and the related verbs in a voiced consonant:

to believe to prove to teethe to house [z]

belief proof teeth house [s]

In some instances, finally, adjectives functioning as nouns fail to develop the full range of nominal properties, such as for example the ability to form plurals. In contrast to heavies, the blind, the rich and the poor have no plural ending in spite of their indubitably plural reference:

There are too few specialists on the education and training of the blind. Why don’t the rich help the poor more?

Apart from the forms cited here, blinds and riches exist as independent nouns with different senses.

DEMONSTRATION/DISCUSSION

Unit 3

Further word-formation strategies in modern English
In addition to the major strategies illustrated above, there are a number of processes which are all based on shortening a base form (rather than adding to it). Clippings, for example, involve the removal of the beginning or end of a longer word:

Minor word-formation processes
Clippings

demonstration → demo

professor

→ prof

omnibus

→ bus

Blends, or portmanteau words, represent the phonetic merger of two words: Blends

breakfast + lunch

→ brunch

information + entertainment → infotainment

modulator + demodulator → modem

Acronyms, made up of the initial sounds/letters of the component parts of a complex word or phrase pronounced as a syllable, have experienced a veritable boom in the recent past, presumably because they are a convenient strategy to cope with long, complex and impenetrable scientific and bureaucratic terminology in everyday communication. The longer an acronym has been current in the language, the less likely people are to be aware of its origin, and the more likely they are to spell it in lower-case letters.

Acronyms

light amplification by the stimulated emission of radiation → LASER → Laser → laser acquired immuno-deficiency syndrome → AIDS anti-social behaviour order → ASBO → Asbo/asbo

While the words laser and AIDS can by now be assumed to be familiar, Asbo/ asbo probably still requires an explanatory gloss: “a court order obtainable by local authorities which places restrictions on the movements or actions of a person who persistently engages in anti-social behaviour. Introduced under Section 1 of the Crime and Disorder Act in 1998 and first applied in 1999” – see OED, s. v. asbo.
If the initial letters of the complex word or phrase are pronounced as such, we have initialisms or alphabetisms. Spelling may vary:

Initialisms and alphabetisms

disc jockey → DJ/dee-jay/deejay television → TV

Back-formations, finally, are cases in which the final part of a word is misconstrued as a derivational ending and speakers construct a base-form which works synchronically but has no historical or etymological justification. Thus on analogy with pairs such as:

Note that the symmetry is perfect synchronically, although the direction of the arrow is of course reversed, in accordance with the historical evidence, which shows us that editor was first attested in English in 1649, whereas the verb followed only in 1791 (OED, s. v. editor and edit).

3.3 Problems and challenges

Inflection or derivation?

The categories and classifications presented above provide useful orientation in a notoriously messy field of linguistic description. The sophisticated student, however, should bear in mind that the boundaries between practically all the processes and categories are fluid. This should not come as a shock or be cause for worry. Rather, it is a sign of the creativity and flexibility with which speakers use their languages, and for linguists such exceptions or problematical cases should serve as challenges to hone their analytical skills.
Consider, as a first illustration, the apparently simple boundary between inflectional and derivational morphemes, the two types of bound morphemes distinguished above. The adverb-forming suffix {-ly} was introduced as a bound grammatical morpheme, and there are two good reasons for doing so. The derivation of adverbs of manner from adjectives appears to be a very regular process, and it is grammatically conditioned.

a rapid talker slow motion beautiful singing …

– to talk rapidly – to move slowly – to sing beautifully

However, closer inspection reveals a number of exceptions. Adjectives ending in -ly (silly, deadly, etc.) lack the corresponding adverb. In a considerable number of other cases, usage is variable, especially in spoken and informal English. While I would not recommend that students write any of the following forms, they are all widely current in actual usage:

come quick, drive slow, speak louder …

With fast, the “exceptional” walk/run/move fast is in fact the only acceptable option, and the “regular” walk fastly is no longer current usage. The adverb form fastly is found in combinations only (as in I am steadfastly opposed to your proposal).

PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES

Unit 3

Even more importantly, the meanings of adjectives and corresponding adverbs may differ. This is most obvious in the case of hard, where the adjective and the formally corresponding adverb hardly have almost nothing in common in terms of meaning. Less conspicuous discrepancies in meaning are numerous: natural – naturally, virtual – virtually, etc.
If, finally, we recall that there is a well-established derivational pattern in which {-ly} serves to create adjectives from nominal bases or other adjectives – as in friend → friendly, mother → motherly, kind → kindly, sick → sickly –, it becomes plausible to re-consider the status of the adverb-forming strategy in terms of word-formation. It would stand alongside these two processes as a more productive third one.
There are many other notoriously difficult-to-define boundaries discussed in any introductory work on English word-formation. When, for example, is a sequence of adjective and noun a compound, and when is it a phrase (i. e. a grammatical construction, see Units 4 and 5)? We can easily see the difference between a black bird and a blackbird. The spelling and the stress pattern differ, the adjective can be modified in the phrase (a very black bird) but not the compound, and so forth. But what about the status of expressions such as golden handshake, silver lining, whispering campaign, running mate, separated fathers?
Similarly permeable is the boundary between derivation and compounding. Historically, many former free lexical morphemes have travelled down the road to become bound derivational morphemes. A prominent example is, in fact, the {-ly} suffix discussed above, which in Old English meant something like “appearance, shape, body” and rapidly generalised its sense to “having the qualities of,” which provided the transition to the present use. We can see stages of the process repeating themselves in present-day English forms such as child-like or war-like. Traffic in the reverse direction – from bound morpheme to free morpheme – is also attested. For example, forms such as super, hyper or mega entered the English language in Latin and Greek loan words such as superfluous, hyperbole or megalomania, then became productive as prefixes (superman, superhuman; hyper-inflation; megaton, mega-city, megagood looking) and finally ended up as free lexical morphemes (you’re super, it was just mega).
Corpora are essential tools for the study of word-formation in contemporary English. Students are probably most likely to search the resources in order to find out what forms are attested and to analyse them.
Linking up to the final remarks of the preceding section, here are 10 (of a total of 239 different) word forms in the British National Corpus starting in mega and not separated from the rest by a hyphen:

MORPHOLOGY AND WORD-FORMATION – THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORD

These words illustrate established usage in contemporary English. There are the learned terms of Greek origin mainly restricted to scientific/academic English, in which mega refers to great size: megachiroptera (“big bat” = flying foxes), megalith (= “big stone”), megalopolis (= “big city”), and – possibly – megageomorphology. Other terms, also belonging to scientific/academic registers, denote units of measurement in which mega indicates a million: megabyte, megaflop (in one of two possible senses, denoting units of computational processing capacity: “Floating Point Operations Per Second”), megajoules. The rest comprises examples of a more recent usage, in which mega combines with ordinary English words such as bid or mix and has a very general intensifying meaning “larger than usual” or “huge.” These words could easily be spelled with a hyphen: mega-bid, mega-bucks, mega-flop (in the non-technical sense), mega-mix. It is these forms which provide the basis for an even more recent use of mega as a free morpheme. These are the first 25 instances of mega spelled as a separate word (from a total of 208) in the British National Corpus:

Unit 3

MORPHOLOGY AND WORD-FORMATION – THE STRUCTURE OF THE WORD

On the strength of such evidence, can we put forward the claim that mega is now an adjective and adverb in English? The answer to this question is a guarded yes, and much rests on the careful interpretation of the examples. For instance, there is no reason to consider forms such as “mega brewers” (1) or “mega popular” (6) as particularly innovative. They could easily be respelled as mega-brewers or mega-popular. Note, though, that sometimes it would be possible to add material in between mega and the following word: the mega commercial brewers, a mega and utterly exhausting portage, and this is only possible on the assumption that mega has been reanalysed (cf. p. 68) as an adjective. In our list, there is at least one clear example which shows that such a reanalysis is possible: “think mega” (example 16).
As usual in corpus-based work, finding the answer to our initial question leads to the formulation of new ones. How common, for example, are combinations such as “mega and,” “really mega” or “rather mega,” in which mega may or must be an adjective?

Practice
1 Use the three past-tense forms attacked, insulted, frightened as a starting point to find out the allomorphic realisations of the past tense form {-ed} and the rules for their distribution.

2 In addition to those mentioned above, there are a number of further exceptions to the productive {-s} pluralisation of present-day English, for example forms such as houses (with voiceless [s] in the singular and voiced [z] in the plural), or wives and wolves (instead of the expected wifes and wolfes). Consult reference grammars of English to find out about the extent of this problem.

Consider s-genitives such as boys’, children’s, Dickens’, wife’s, Bob’s, Pat’s, Jones’s. Is the genitive {-s} subject to the same allomorphic distribution as the plural? Where are the similarities and contrasts?

PRACTICE

3 In addition to the nouns ending in -tion given above (organisation, realisation, detention, retention), there are others, such as action, destruction, obstruction, recuperation, designation. Which additional problems do these new examples pose for a linguist attempting to find out the rules for the distribution of the various allomorphs?

4 One of the most productive derivational processes in present-day English is agentnoun formation by means of {-er}. Look up the meanings of the following examples in a dictionary:
painter, baker, (pencil-)sharpener, computer, teller, goer, printer, sitter
Now try to separate that part of the meaning of these forms which is predictable from the mere word-formation process involved and then go on to specify which additional components of meaning have been lexicalised by convention in each case.

5 Staying with the {-er} suffix, discuss the following complex forms. Try to extend the list by adding similar examples. Discuss issues such as the placement of the derivational morpheme and possible differences in meaning between the agent nouns used alone or in combination.
cinema-lover, movie-goer, story-teller make-upper, maker up a maker up of fantastic tales

Unit 4
Syntax I/general principles – the structure of the clause

Orientation

4.1

Words, phrases, clauses and sentences

4.1.1

The present Unit is concerned with the grammatical structure of sentences. For the time being, and for the purposes of a first definition, the term sentence is used here in its every-day understanding of “grammatically complete portion of an utterance, usually closed off by a full stop, a question-mark or an exclamation-mark in writing.” This, incidentally, hints at the three basic functional types of sentences, namely (1) declarative sentences or statements, (2) interrogative sentences or questions, and (3) imperative sentences or commands, as illustrated by the following examples:

Sentence types

Sue lost my copy of Huddleston’s grammar. What did Sue lose? Don’t lose my copy of Huddleston’s grammar.

One important component of grammar, inflectional morphology, has already been mentioned in the preceding Unit. The other component, to be dealt with here, is syntax. The term is derived from a Greek word originally meaning “arrangement,” for example the arrangement of troops in battle. In linguistics, it is the traditional term used for the study of the rules which help us combine words into sentences. The relationship between morphology, syntax and grammar can thus be conceived of as follows:

Grammar = inflectional morphology and syntax

morphology = word formation + inflectional morphology

syntax

= grammar – inflectional morphology

grammar = syntax + inflectional morphology

So far, the term sentence has served us well enough in our introductory definitions. For the purposes of detailed syntactic analysis, however, it is often not precise enough and therefore raises a number of problems. In spite of their differences, for example, all of the following would qualify as sentences:

Sentence versus clause

Off with you! Don’t leave now! I’m going home. If only I had remembered her phone number! … because I don’t want to lose you as a friend.

SYNTAX I/GENERAL PRINCIPLES – THE STRUCTURE OF THE CLAUSE

[No political party in France can afford [to be suspected [of neglecting [to defend the classical heritage of the language]]]], [because [in so doing] it would run a genuine risk [of being accused of cultural treason by the small coterie of opinion makers [who on the strength of their prestige as intellectuals wield considerable influence in publishing]]].

Finite, non-finite, verbless clauses

If we want to capture the specific structural features of each of these six sentences, we’d better focus on the clause as the basic unit of description. A clause can be regarded as the linguistic representation of a state of affairs, usually (but not always) built around a verb as a nucleus and a varying number of constituents. In the list given above, the first five sentences are made up of exactly one clause each. The sixth, by contrast, contains eight clauses which are integrated into a complex hierarchical structure.
With regard to their outer form, clauses are divided into three categories: (1) finite clauses, in which the verb is marked for tense and person, (2) nonfinite clauses (which are built around an infinitive, gerund or participle), and (3) verbless clauses – depending on the form of the verb (or its presence or absence).

(1) finite clauses: Where are you going? … because everybody wanted to hear more.
(2) non-finite clauses: Made in England. … in order to keep track of the latest developments. With more and more people taking up a vegetarian diet …
(3) verbless clause: Off with you!

Main and subordinate clauses
Phrases and constituents

With regard to their function, clauses are divided into main clauses, capable of standing on their own (e. g. I’m going home), and subordinate clauses, which expand or otherwise modify a main clause or another subordinate clause (e. g. [I’m only putting up with this] because I don’t want to lose you as a friend). While finite clauses are unrestricted in their occurrence, non-finite and verbless clauses tend to occur in subordinate function (although, as the survey above shows, there are exceptions to this rule).
It should be noted that the loose definition of syntax given above (“… combine words into sentences”) remains imprecise in one important regard even after we have introduced the notion of clause as the basic unit of analysis. A clause is not a hierarchically unstructured sequence of words; between the level of the word and the clause there is the intermediate layer of the phrase or constituent. The following example shows how, strictly speaking, words are combined into phrases which then combine into clauses.

ORIENTATION

Unit 4

This is not just a sequence of eleven orthographic words, but a clause which comprises eleven words which are grouped into four phrases or constituents.

[the professor] [gave] [every student] [a copy of the exam paper]

In traditional grammar, these constituents would be referred to as the subject, the predicate, the indirect object and the direct object, respectively. A detailed survey of phrase types in English will be given in Unit 5. Here, we merely need to distinguish between three major types of phrases, noun phrases or NPs (with a noun at their centre), verb phrases or VPs (with a verbal nucleus), and prepositional phrases or PPs (phrases depending on a preposition).
There are various grammatical operations which change the order of elements in the sentence, and such changes most often affect the order of constituents rather than the order of words. For instance, we can change our example sentence into:

Noun phrases, verb phrases, prepositional phrases

[the professor] [gave] [a copy of the exam paper] [to every student]

Constituent number three in the original version has now become the last, and been changed from a noun phrase into a prepositional phrase in the process.
Note that while the existence of the phrase level of structure (i. e. a level between the word/morpheme, on the one hand, and the clause, on the other) is uncontroversial, there may be disagreements as to how precisely we should segment a clause into its constituent phrases. There is one widely used model of syntactic analysis in which the verbal predicate is considered the nucleus of the clause, and all three nominal constituents (NPs) would be regarded as in some way dependent on this nucleus. We could visualise the relation between them and the predicate as follows:

The verb as the centre of the clause

Fig. 4.1 Syntactic analysis – verb as nucleus of the sentence/clause

An alternative approach wants to do justice to the fact that the subject is less directly under the control of the verb than the objects. Accordingly, the first step in a grammatical analysis of a clause is to distinguish between the subject and the rest (which would be analysed as one big verb phrase, consisting of the verb and its objects). This assumed relationship of dependency can be represented by double bracketing or, more conveniently, in the shape of a tree diagram in which S stands for sentence/clause, NP for noun phrase and VP for verb phrase:

Constituent analysis in ambiguous sentences

The crucial importance of the phrase or constituent level of structural organisation becomes apparent particularly in sentences which are ambiguous, i. e. which have two different interpretations depending on the analysis one adopts:

I bought him a book about medieval sculpture in Ireland.

Here the meaning and the constructional potential of the sentence entirely depend on the phrase structure or constituent structure which is assumed. If we proceed from:

[[I] [[bought] [him] [a book about medieval sculpture in Ireland]]]

or – to represent this in the more accessible shape of a syntactic tree:

– we are talking about a book whose subject is medieval sculpture in Ireland. On this analysis, we could not move “in Ireland” to the beginning of the sentence:
* In Ireland I bought him a book about medieval sculpture.
This sentence is not wrong, but changes the meaning of the original fundamentally. Likewise, we couldn’t ask a question about “in Ireland,” because – in

In Ireland I bought him a book about medieval sculpture. Where did I buy him a book about medieval sculpture?

Form categories and their grammatical functions

4.1.2

Most approaches to syntactic/grammatical description are based on a distinction between form (or category) and function (= the task a form performs in its grammatical context). In languages, there is no easy one-to-one mapping between category and function. Normally, one linguistic form may have several different functions:

One form, different functions

form 1

function 1 function 2 function 3 … function n

SYNTAX I/GENERAL PRINCIPLES – THE STRUCTURE OF THE CLAUSE

For example, to every student is an example of the form-type (or grammatical category) prepositional phrase. In our example above ([the professor] [gave] [a copy of the exam paper] [to every student]), it functioned as a prepositional object. Besides that, it can serve a whole range of other functions:

– complement of adjective: … a book useful to every student

– modification of noun: … an urgent appeal to every student

– adverbial of place:

… go to every student

One function, Conversely, a specific grammatical function within the sentence, for example different forms the subject function, can be realised by many different form categories:

Fig. 4.6 One syntactic function can be realised
by several forms

form 1 form 2 form 3 … form n

function 1

At least the following form categories can all function as grammatical subjects:
noun phrase (the usual case): The holiday was a disaster. clause (common enough): That she was willing to forgive him is a little
miracle. [finite subject clause] To wait any longer would be a waste of time. [non-finite subject clause] prepositional phrase (rare): From Stratford-upon-Avon to Luton Airport takes longer than the flight from London to Rome.
As such diverse form-function mapping is the rule rather than the exception, the grammar of a language ultimately reveals itself to be a complex web of the following type:

This looks complicated. Ultimately, though, this is what makes human languages such powerful, flexible and expressive tools for creating and expressing meaning or – as the English idiom goes – for “making sense.”

Demonstration/discussion

4.2

Basic strategies for the expression of grammatical relations

4.2.1

Probably nowhere is the difference between languages greater than in their grammatical systems. Regardless of these differences, however, all languages use the same four fundamental strategies for the expression of grammatical relations, and the differences among them are thus merely due to the fact that the relative prominence of each strategy is variable across languages. Before studying the design features of the grammar of present-day English in detail in Unit 5, we will therefore look at what these basic strategies are and how they work.

Four basic strategies for expressing grammatical relations

Grammatical relations can be expressed through:
1) word order 2) inflection 3) function words, or free grammatical morphemes 4) intonation.

1) Word order

In modern English word order (or, to put it more precisely, the order of constituents or phrases) is one of the most important ways of coding grammatical relations in a sentence. Changes in the order of constituents are almost always associated with changes in meaning or lead to ungrammaticality:

Word order

the girl forgot the boy the boy forgot the girl the boy the girl forgot the girl the boy forgot

I had smashed my car-window I had my car-window smashed * my car-window had I smashed

As the following comparison shows, movement for emphasis in order to produce a balanced information structure in the clause is highly restricted in English, but fairly common in German:

I wouldn’t give him another chance.

SYNTAX I/GENERAL PRINCIPLES – THE STRUCTURE OF THE CLAUSE

In this sentence, the constituent order is fixed. We can change the order of objects, but only if we turn one of them into a prepositional phrase.
I wouldn’t give another chance to him.
We can front both objects, but only if we put an emphatic sentence accent on them (indicated by capital letters). This works better for the first example than for the second:
HIM I wouldn’t give another chance. ? ANOTHER CHANCE I wouldn’t give him.
If we retained the normal intonation (*him I wouldn’t give another chance), this wouldn’t work, and the remaining possible orders are out of the question in any kind of intonation:
* HIM/him wouldn’t I give another chance. * ANOTHER CHANCE/another chance wouldn’t I give him.
This is very different from German, where a much larger number of constituent orderings is possible, and the contrasts in emphasis are often minimal.
Ich würde ihm nicht eine/keine zweite Chance geben. Eine zweite Chance würde ich ihm nicht geben. Ihm würde ich nicht eine/keine zweite Chance geben. ? Nicht geben würde ich ihm eine zweite Chance.
While, out of context, some people may not like the fourth option, a little twiddling makes even this acceptable – for example by inserting aber:
Nicht geben würde ich ihm aber eine zweite Chance, denn die verdient er nicht.

2) Inflection

Inflection

In the course of its history, English has shed most of its inflectional endings. Today, we find inflection used to form the plural and genitive of nouns, the 3rdperson singular and past tense of verbs, and the comparative and superlative forms of monosyllabic and some disyllabic adjectives:

one book

– two books

the director

– the director’s decision

I play the guitar

– she plays the guitar

I play the guitar

– I played the guitar

hot, simple, narrow – hotter, simpler, narrower/hottest, simplest,

narrowest

DEMONSTRATION/DISCUSSION

Unit 4

Comparing German and English, we often note that grammatical relationships expressed through inflection in the former are expressed by grammatical function words (to, of, on) in the latter:
sie widmete ihre Dissertation ihren Eltern she dedicated her thesis to her parents
das musst Du Deiner Freundin erklären that’s something you’ve got to explain to your girl-friend
die giftigen Abgase der Fabriken the poisonous fumes of the factories

An English noun (such as, say, eagle) has the following forms:

Common case: Genitive:

Singular: eagle eagle’s

Plural: eagles eagles’

The equivalent paradigm in German is:

Nominative: Genitive: Dative: Accusative:

Singular: der Adler des Adlers dem Adler den Adler

Plural: die Adler der Adler den Adlern die Adler

Fig. 4.8 Nominal inflection in English and German

Note that the noun has only three distinct inflectional forms – Adler, Adlers and Adlern – but the combination of definite article and noun tends to uniquely identify a particular case-number combination. German nouns come in fairly arbitrary gender classes: die Krähe, for example, is feminine, das Huhn neuter. But even if the name of a bird is masculine, it may still belong to a different declension class from Adler.

Nominative: Genitive: Dative: Accusative:

Singular: der Falke des Falken dem Falken den Falken

Plural: die Falken der Falken den Falken die Falken

3) Function words

Function words, or free grammatical morphemes, are usually identical in form to prepositions, but differ from them in that they have lost their concrete spatial or temporal meanings and are used to express purely grammatical relations. This is obvious in the examples given above for dedicate something to someone and explain something to someone, where the original directional meaning of

SYNTAX I/GENERAL PRINCIPLES – THE STRUCTURE OF THE CLAUSE

to has been lost. As a result, to does not contrast with from any longer, as it would in the original prepositional use of these words. Compare:

I am going to Norwich. I’m just coming back from Norwich.

Explain it to me.

*Explain it from me.

Similarly, on in the following example does not mean that somebody literally collapsed on top of us but merely that we were adversely affected by the event:

he was so drunk he passed out on us [“er war so betrunken, dass er uns ohnmächtig wurde”]

Other common grammatical function words in present-day English are of, expressing a wide variety of grammatical relations in noun phrases, and more and most, which are used in the comparison of some disyllabic and all polysyllabic adjectives.

the children of a widely respected local dignitary a novelist of considerable reputation an ounce of pure gold the City of London this execrable fool of a student

humid, wonderful – more humid, most humid/more wonderful, most wonderful

4) Intonation

Intonation

Intonation plays a minor role both in English and German in coding grammatical structure. Both languages, for example, have the option of turning a statement into a question through a change from falling to rising intonation (although of course the usual way of forming a question involves a change of word order in addition to a change in intonation):

Sie sind Student? You are a student? [cf. Sind Sie Student? Are you a student?]

In English, intonation helps to distinguish between restrictive relative clauses (which are integrated into the contour of the higher clause) and non-restrictive relative clauses (which are pronounced as a separate intonation contour – with a short break that is usually represented as a comma in writing). Thus:

the students who were waiting in the lobby were sent home

implies that there is a larger number of students and only a portion of them, namely those who were waiting in the lobby, were sent home, whereas:

the students, who were waiting in the lobby, were sent home

Typological classification of languages

4.2.2

Languages can be classified into diachronic “families” on the basis of their common origin and historical relationship. In this historical-comparative approach, English turns out to be related to German or Dutch, more distantly to Latin or Albanian, and even more distantly to the ancient Indian Sanskrit language (see Unit 12 and Fig. 12.1 for further discussion). However, languages can also be classified from a synchronic point of view. Such a typological classification is usually based on a limited number of parameters and allows for historically unrelated languages to end up in the same typological group. For example, it might turn out that English shares some basic grammatical properties with Chinese. The pioneers of this approach to language study include August Wilhelm Schlegel (1767–1845), Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835) or Edward Sapir (1884–1939) – all scholars who shared an interest in “exotic” languages – whether Indian, Far Eastern or Native American. One of the earliest typologies was based on the dominant shape of the word in a given language and distinguished three (later four) types of languages.
The isolating type tends towards maximally simple words, i. e. a situation in which most words consist of one morpheme only. Languages of the agglutinating type may have long and complex words, but these are structured transparently and can be assembled and disassembled easily. The inflectional (or fusional) type has words which are complex and show signs of fusion, i. e. words are much less transparent than in the agglutinating type. Languages of the polysynthetic (or incorporating) type, finally, have words which are extremely long and complex and very often encompass almost the entire information in a clause. Some languages correspond rather closely to one or the other of these ideal types. Thus, classical Chinese is said to be a near perfect illustration of the isolating type. Turkish illustrates the agglutinating type, Latin or Russian the inflectional type, and Inuit (= “Eskimo”) or some Aboriginal Australian languages the polysynthetic type. Consider, for example, the following Turkish words, which show agglutination at work:

Diachronic language families

SYNTAX I/GENERAL PRINCIPLES – THE STRUCTURE OF THE CLAUSE

Latin, English, Most languages, however, represent mixed types. Consider, for example, the German following English expressions and their German and Latin translations:

he/she would have said er/sie hätte gesagt dixisset

to the king dem König regi

Analytical and synthetic languages

Latin clearly instantiates the inflectional type here: the words are complex with regard to their internal structure, and much more difficult to disassemble than the Turkish examples above. English reveals itself to be close to the isolating type. Assuming that would is not synchronically analysed as the past of will but as an independent modal verb, the expression he/she would have said contains three words which consist of one morpheme only (he/she, would, have) and only one word (said) which is internally complex. The same is true for to the king: the lexical morpheme king occurs on its own, and the grammatical information, “dative” and “definiteness” is coded on two separate words each. German is in between Latin and English in both cases.
On the basis of this word-based typology, a simpler two-way classification has been proposed into analytical and synthetic languages. The parameter of comparison here is clause structure. Analytical grammars code grammatical relations through word-order rules and free grammatical morphemes (or function words), whereas synthetic languages rely on inflection to do the job. Clearly, languages with a lot of inflected or fused words will end up in the synthetic type, whereas isolating languages will be highly analytical. Again, most languages stay away from the extremes and represent various types of mixture. Thus, English is clearly more analytical than German, although there are languages which have even fewer inflections than modern English. Also, as we have noted above, there is language-internal variation within English, for example in the case of di-syllabic adjectives, which allow both analytical and synthetic comparison: narrow – more narrow – most narrow vs. narrow – narrower – narrowest.

4.3 Problems and challenges

No rule without exception

An obvious challenge to grammatical descriptions is the fact that there are hardly any rules which have not got numerous exceptions. If a rule is formulated badly, the exceptions that we find may lead us to discard, or at least to refine, the rule. However, the situation is rarely so simple. Exceptions will remain even after several cycles of such refinement, and the linguist will have to get used to the idea that grammatical rules are not as fixed and immutable

PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES

as mathematical algorithms or the laws of nature but closer to human social conventions, which remain binding even while they are violated occasionally.
In a natural human language a rule must be a tendency strong enough to give the speaker and listener orientation, but a margin of flexibility is desirable if only because it allows flexible responses to new communicative challenges. In other words: exceptions should not trouble the analyst; they are to be expected, and there are usually good reasons for an apparent violation of a rule. As an example, consider the strict S-V-O (Subject-Verb-Object) constituent order of modern English. It is conformed to in the following sentences, and inserting the adverbial between the verb and the object results in ungrammaticality:
They speak English really well. Did Shakespeare write any of his plays in Stratford?
* They speak really well English. * Did Shakespeare write in Stratford any of his plays?
In the following sentence, by contrast, the “violation” of the rule is tolerated:
I speak well only those foreign languages which I started in school and then practiced on the job.
In fact, the technically correct version – I speak only those foreign languages which I started in school and then practiced on the job well – would be avoided because it could give rise to misunderstandings. In the trade-off between grammatical correctness and communicative effectiveness speakers are unwilling to pay a price which is too high.
As a second example, consider a form category, the English adjective. A typical English adjective such as happy or tired displays the following four properties.
1) It can be used as an attribute of a noun: the happy prince, a tired excuse 2) It can be used predicatively: we’re not too happy about it, I am tired 3) It has comparative and superlative forms: happier – happiest, more tired –
most tired 4) It can be premodified by adverbials: very happy, extremely tired.
The tests show that tired, while historically originating as the participle of the verb to tire and still displaying the relevant ending (-ed), has now lost its verbal status.
Note, however, that not all adjectives in English are syntactically wellbehaved. Consider, for instance, mere and utter. Mere fulfils criterion (1) – a mere hint of a foreign accent – and, at least partly, criterion (3): the superlative the merest hint of a foreign accent is o.k., while the comparative *a merer hint of a foreign accent would be difficult to imagine. It clearly fails, though, on criteria (2) and (4): * the hint of a foreign accent was mere, * a very mere hint

of a foreign accent. The adjective utter does even more badly, failing all but the first test: utter nonsense, but not * the nonsense was utter, * utterest nonsense, * very utter nonsense.
In dealing with apparent exceptions to grammatical rules or instances of variable usage, students will find linguistic corpora immensely helpful. For example, the following is one of hundreds of similar examples from the British National Corpus in which the adjective interesting is used to qualify the subject of a sentence and in which it follows this subject:
But her face was interesting and intelligent and attractive.
We would be unlikely to find the variant But interesting and intelligent and attractive was her face, with the subject complement preceding the subject it describes. Alongside the hundreds of regular cases, however, we do find a fair number of exceptions which instantiate precisely this sequence. Here are five of them:

Fig. 4.11 Exceptional inversion
of subject and verb

CJ4 162 HH3 14136 A1B 651 APH 820
BNV 145

Even more interesting was the fact that over 300 cars were parked at the Park and Ride facility at Harman’s Cross which obviously reduced the level of traffic along the road to Swanage by that amount.
Most interesting was an interview with Mark Tolliver, a freelance pilot and convicted drug smuggler.
Particularly interesting is the fact that, after backing so many winners, Pound in The Exile backed unmistakably at least one loser.
Perhaps the least interesting is the possibility that the change of context modifies the way in which the CS is perceived, either because of some change in the physical nature of the signal (the properties of an auditory cue, for instance, are likely to change according to the shape of the space in which it is presented) or because there is some change in the way the cue impinges on the animal (if different contexts promote different patterns of orienting behaviour, the same cue, defined physically, may be experienced differently in the contexts).
Equally interesting is the inclusion of some informative footage showing how a Concorde captain is type-converted.

Even these five cases will give you a pretty good idea for the conditions in which we tend to accept this unusual order of constituents. Formulate your hypotheses and use a corpus of your choice to test them.

Unit 5
Syntax II/the fundamentals of English grammar

Orientation

5.1

While Unit 4 was devoted to the study of some important general principles of syntax, the present Unit focuses on a more practical and mundane task – to identify and name the parts or constituents of English clauses and establish the structural relationships that hold between them. In line with the framework established in Unit 4, we will start with a look at the parts of speech in English, i. e. the word classes which we arrive at when we categorise English words on the basis of their differing grammatical potential. We will then move on to a discussion of phrases, semi-autonomous grammatical constructions which are the immediate building blocks or constituents of other more complex phrases or of clauses.

From general linguistics to the grammatical description of present-day English

Parts of speech

5.1.1

The grammarians of ancient Greece and Rome have left us a grammatical classification of words which, in spite of its known weaknesses, has turned out to be surprisingly robust and is still at the heart of most modern taxonomies. They suggest a distinction between nouns (e. g. organisation, Peter, table), pronouns (e. g. he, them, who), adjectives (e. g. happy, sad), prepositions (e. g. in, on, from), verbs (e. g. govern, assimilate), adverbs (e. g. rapidly, here, yesterday), conjunctions (e. g. because, so that) and interjections (e. g. Oh!, Ouch!). To this we might add the category of articles (the, a, an), which is a useful one for the description of English but was not really needed for Latin.
Parts of speech come in two major classes. Autosemantic words are those which have a fairly precise meaning by themselves, whereas synsemantic words express very general concepts such as spatial, temporal or causal relations and acquire specific meanings only in conjunction with autosemantic words. Thus, we do not need any context to get the meaning of the autosemantic noun railway station, whereas the preposition from or the definite article the, two synsemantic words, do not convey meaning in the same degree of specificity by themselves. They do so, however, in conjunction with railway station; from the railway station is very different from above or over the railway station, and from the railway station is different from from a railway station. Autosemantic words generally form open classes, which contain large numbers of members and can be expanded easily. Synsemantic words tend to form closed classes, with few members and only very occasional expansion or contraction.

SYNTAX II/THE FUNDAMENTALS OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR

These are the major part-of-speech classes of present-day English.

Table 5.1 Autosemantic parts
of speech

Autosemantic parts of speech

Nouns

English nouns are inflected for number (singular/plural: one girl – several girls) and, particularly but not exclusively for nouns denoting human referents, for genitive case (e. g. the girl’s book, the girls’ books, the book’s cover). Noun phrases (the girls, the two American girls, all the girls who attended the course, …) typically function as subjects or objects in simple clauses. So do German nouns, but owing to the comparatively more synthetic design of German grammar, German nouns show considerably more inflectional complexity (number, case, gender inflection specific to declension classes).

Verbs

English verbs are inflected for tense (present/past), moderately also for person (3rd person singular in the present tense) and for mood (indicative/subjunctive: God saves the Queen vs. God save the Queen). In addition to these purely inflectional forms there are many further complex analytical structures expressing tense, aspect and modality. In comparison to German, the obligatory aspect distinction (simple vs. continuous form: What do you read? – What are you reading?) is a striking feature of the verbal grammar of present-day English.

Adjectives

English adjectives are inflected for comparison if they consist of one syllable. They are graded analytically, with more and most, if they consist of three or more syllables, with some variation between synthetic and analytical comparison for di-syllabic adjectives.

Adverbs

Most English adverbs, in particular those derived from adjectives by adding -ly, function as autosemantic words: rapidly, unexpectedly, happily, etc.

Table 5.2 Synsemantic parts of
speech

Synsemantic parts of speech

Adverbs

A small number of morphologically simple adverbs, e. g. more or therefore, express more abstract concepts than the open-class adverbs discussed above.

Articles

Present-day English has a definite (the) and an indefinite article (a(n)). Whether forms such as no – as in he’s no fool (= he’s not a fool) – should be included in this category is an open question.

Pronouns

Pronouns largely overlap with nouns in their grammatical function. Commonly distinguished sub-classes of pronouns are personal pronouns (I/me, you, he/him, she/her, it, we/us, they/them), demonstrative pronouns (this, that, these, those), indefinite pronouns (somebody, anybody, …), reflexive pronouns (forms ending in -self and -selves) or reciprocal pronouns (each other, one another).

Prepositions

Prepositions usually express relationships between nouns and noun phrases. The most common prepositions are morphologically simple and phonologically very light: for, from, in, etc. In addition, there are complex prepositions, which are morphologically complex and usually express more specialised relations: during, notwithstanding, on account of, etc.

ORIENTATION

Unit 5

Conjunctions

Conjunctions typically express relationships between clauses. There are co-ordinating (and, or, but) and subordinating conjunctions (because, that, while, …).

Where are the weaknesses of this classification which have been alluded to above? One category which is a messy one if applied to present-day English is the pronoun. If defined as a “pro” or replacement form for a noun, the category works only for some of the pronouns mentioned above, for example the personal pronouns. Many indefinite pronouns function as pronouns in this sense but in addition they also display adjectival or adverbial properties to varying degrees. Compare, for example, the following uses of some:

Pronouns and determiners

What about the students? Did any turn up? Yes, some did but not many in fact.

Some of the students even wore three-piece suits. Some students even wore three-piece suits.

There is some interest in this subject, but it is limited. There were some five-hundred people present at the lecture. That was some party we had last night, wasn’t it?

The first two examples are pronouns in the narrow sense – some stands in for the noun students. All following uses, however, display additional properties: for example, some in some five-hundred is an adverbial qualification, and some in some party is practically synonymous with a great party or a terrific party.
In view of the obvious overlap between articles, pronouns and adjectives functioning in pre-nominal modification, new types of part-of-speech categories have been suggested in recent linguistics, for example a class “determiner” which comprises items such as a(n), the, all, both, each, some, many and others which all help to specify, quantify or otherwise determine the general meaning of the following noun.

Phrases

5.1.2

As has already been pointed out, it is not words which combine into clauses and sentences but phrases or constituents. The most common types of phrases are noun phrases (NP), prepositional phrases (PP), verb phrases (VP), adjective phrases (AdjP) and adverb phrases (AdvP). The phrases are named after their heads and include the heads and their dependents or modifiers. This is simple enough in the case of NPs, PPs, AdjPs and AdvPs, as is illustrated in the following examples, in which the respective heads are printed in bold:

SYNTAX II/THE FUNDAMENTALS OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR

NP: the boy

a boy who was playing in the sand

PP: to another famous city notwithstanding the problems involved

AdjP: better

extremely keen to take part

AdvP: right here

much more easily than expected

A verb phrase (VP) typically consists of a main verb, the auxiliaries which modify it, and those phrases or constituents other than the subject which are necessary to form a basic clause (see 5.1.3 below). These are some examples, in increasing order of complexity.

VPs: the roof [collapsed]VP last night the roof [could have collapsed]VP last night I [finished my term paper]VP last night I [put the alarm clock on the shelf]VP last night
The phrase last night is not bracketed as part of the preceding VP because it can be dropped without making the sentence structurally incomplete. By contrast, my term paper, the alarm clock and on the shelf are bracketed because these phrases need to be there to make the verb phrase complete.
In terms of the category-function distinction outlined in the previous unit, phrases, like words, are form-categories, and their function only becomes apparent in the context of the clause. For example, the prepositional phrase to another famous city functions as an object in the first of the two following examples, but as an adverbial of place in the second:

this passage of the book refers [to another famous city]PP the coach took the tourists [to another famous city]PP
The difference between the functional status of the PP in each case clearly comes out in the two different questions we can form: What does this passage of the book refer to? and Where did the coach take the tourists (to)?
As the following example shows, phrases can be expanded to a considerable degree of complexity. The longish sentence:

Heads and modifiers of phrases

[the man]NP [read [an interesting book about the history of abstract painting in early twentieth-century Britain]NP]VP
consists of just three phrases – as bracketed. the man illustrates a simple type of noun phrase, consisting of the noun itself and a determiner, the definite article. The dependency relation is such that the noun is conventionally seen as the head of the phrase and the determiner as the modifier. In principle this modifier-head structure is no different from that found in the long and complex noun phrase an interesting book about the history of abstract painting in early twentieth-century Britain. The noun book is the head of this noun phrase. It is premodified by the indefinite article an, the adjective interesting and postmodified by the prepositional phrase about the history of abstract painting in

early twentieth-century Britain, whose structure is internally complex, as well. Similar expansion strategies can be applied in verb phrases, adjectival phrases or adverb phrases.

The seven basic clause patterns

5.1.3

Identifying the phrases which make up a clause (or any other complex construction) is the necessary first step in a proper grammatical analysis. By identifying a noun phrase, for example, you have identified a particular formal category. You have not said anything yet about its function in the clause. In this section, we will therefore look at the ways in which NPs, PPs, AdjPs and AdvPs serve to complement the verb (which, as has been pointed out in the preceding Unit, we assume to be the structural nucleus of the clause). In this way we can offer a full grammatical analysis. The technical terms used are largely those found in traditional grammar (e. g. subject, object) or in widely used reference grammars of English (e. g. complement of the subject), but care is taken to define them in such a way that they suit the facts of English.
Superficially, there is an immense variety of different clause structures, and if you start analysing the clauses in any given text you might come to the depressing conclusion that no two are structured alike. Fortunately, this first impression is deceptive, and closer inspection reveals a relatively simple underlying mechanism. All simple sentences in English correspond to one of the seven basic clause patterns which are discussed and illustrated below:

Basic clause patterns

1. subject + predicate 2. subject + predicate + subject complement 3. subject + predicate + adverbial 4. subject + predicate + object 5. subject + predicate + object + object 6. subject + predicate + object + object complement 7. subject + predicate + object + adverbial

SPA SPO SPOO SPOC

Table 5.3 The seven basic clause patterns

The patterns differ with regard to the number and type of constituents which are needed in addition to the subject to form a grammatical sentence.
The simplest pattern (SP) is illustrated by examples such as the following:

S We Tom The children

P left. snores. are sleeping.

As can be seen in the second and third examples, the grammatical relationship between the subject and the verbal predicate manifests itself not only

SYNTAX II/THE FUNDAMENTALS OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR

on the level of meaning but also of form. The singular noun Tom agrees in number with the following verb (snore + s), and the children agrees with the present plural form of the verb to be rather than one of its singular alternatives. Subject-verb agreement or concord of this type is, of course, marked much more richly in languages which are more inflectional (or less analytical) than English.
The three-element patterns (SPCS, SPA, SPO) all have another obligatory constituent in addition to the subject. If this constituent refers to the same person, thing or state of affairs as the subject, it is a complement of the subject, and we analyse the pattern as SPCS. Such subject complements are usually adjective phrases or noun phrases:

S

P

Sally

is

CS a student.

Sally

is

intelligent.

Sally

became

very interested in sports.

If the constituent following the verb does not refer to the same entity as the subject but introduces a new participant in the verbal activity, this is usually an instance of the pattern SPO. “Direct” objects follow the verb directly, whereas prepositional objects are linked to the verb by means of a preposition.

S My sister Arsenal Many people

P is reading beat talk

O the paper. Manchester United. about Professor Smith’s latest book.

In the pattern SPA the verb phrase is followed by an adverbial, usually indicating the place or time of the verbal situation:

S The film I We

P lasts ran are going

A two hours. down a steep hill. home.

Object or adverbial?

Occasionally, for example if a plain noun phrase or certain kinds of prepositional phrases follow the verb, doubts may arise as to whether the postverbal constituent is an object or an adverbial. This uncertainty can usually be resolved quite easily by means of a few grammatical tests. Objects can be made the focus of questions starting with who, whom or what, whereas adverbials are usually asked for with when, where, how, why or some more specific variant of these. Also, objects can become subjects of passive clauses, whereas adverbials cannot. On the strength of these two tests, at the railway station can clearly be analysed as an adverbial in the following clause:

DEMONSTRATION/DISCUSSION

Unit 5

We finally arrived at the railway station. Where did we finally arrive (at)? * What did we finally arrive (at)? * The railway station was arrived at.

By contrast, in the metaphorical use of arrive at illustrated in the next example, the constituent following the verb phrase has got all the properties of an object:

We arrived at an acceptable compromise. * Where did we arrive (at)? What did we arrive at? An acceptable compromise was arrived at.

Of the three three-constituent-patterns discussed (SPCS, SPA, SPO), one (SPO) can be expanded further by adding another object, an object complement or an
adverbial. The double-object pattern is illustrated by the following examples:

S Who The guide Many of them

P gave explained rely

O you everything on the state

O this book? to us. for support.

In the give-type example, the first object is usually called the “indirect” object and almost always refers to an animate referent who is affected by the verbal transaction. The second object, in our example the book, is the “direct” object. Objects realised as prepositional phrases are usually referred to as “prepositional” objects.
The characteristic feature of the SPOCo pattern is that the second postverbal constituent does not introduce a new participant but further specifies the object in some way:

S You Everybody

P

O

make

me

considers Sally

Co nervous.
the best choice.

In the SPOA pattern, the object is followed by an adverbial:

S

P

O

A

He

put

the book on the shelf.

We

Demonstration/discussion

5.2

Is it really possible to assign any given clause that we might find in a text to one of the seven basic clause types? The answer is yes, if we take into account a few simple expansion strategies which provide the link between the simple basic system and the multiplicity of structures encountered in “live” data.

SYNTAX II/THE FUNDAMENTALS OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR

1) Addition of optional adverbials indicating circumstances in the clause

Optional adverbials

Unlike the obligatory adverbials in the SPA and SPOA patterns, which are needed to make the clause grammatical, there are optional adverbials – (A) – which can be added to any of the basic clause types without any formal restrictions as long as such an addition makes sense. (These optional adverbials are also often referred to as adjuncts.)
Thus, a sentence such as:

Peter yawned a lot at the meeting last night.

reduces to a case of SP (Peter yawned), expanded by three optional adverbials which indicate the manner, the place and the time of the yawning:

S

P

(A) (A)

(A)

Peter yawned a lot at the meeting last night.

2) Expansion of constituents through pre- and postmodification
Pre- and post- Constituents can also be made more complex and longer internally through modification elaborate pre- and postmodification. Consider, for example, the following
example – taken from the scientific texts assembled in the F-LOB corpus:
In a recent paper (Kemball-Cook et al., 1990), we demonstrated a modified sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) method for visualization of factor VIII heavy chain (FVIII HC) polypeptides.
This is a straightforward case of (A)SPO. In a recent paper (Kemball-Cook et al., 1990) is an optional adverbial, and a modified sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) method for visualization of factor VIII heavy chain (FVIII HC) polypeptides is one single (admittedly very complex) object.

3) Clause embedding and clause combining

Embedding It is also possible to replace any constituent phrase except the verbal predicate itself by a clause. In this way, an object, for example, may be expanded into an object clause (which itself may contain further embedded clauses).

S P I cannot believe I cannot believe I cannot believe

O this. that you never noticed it. that you never noticed that he was in love with you.

In a similar way, we might add a further adverbial, in the form of a clause, to the three existing ones in another one of our example sentences:

If there is a hierarchical relationship between the clauses of a sentence (i. e. one is superordinate and the other is subordinate or dependent – cf. Unit 4, p. 57–59), we speak of a complex sentence. If we coordinate independent clauses (by means of conjunctions such as and, or or but), we produce a compound sentence. Actually attested sentences are often the result of both processes applying simultaneously.

Complex and compound sentences

[There is a modern tendency to regard Mozart’s lively buffo music as deliberately cynical], but [I find it hard [to believe [that this high-spirited, joyous music was meant to be taken at anything other than face value]]].

The second of the main or independent clauses coordinated by but here is complex in its internal structure. (Note, incidentally, that the distinction between simple sentences, compound sentences and complex sentences is the one area of syntactic description in which the every-day term sentence, whose use was discouraged above, still retains a proper technical sense.)

Problems and challenges

5.3

One fragment of the grammar in which present-day English develops extreme degrees of complexity is non-finite clauses, that is dependent clauses organised around non-finite (that is tense-less) forms of the verb such as infinitives (sing, to sing) or gerunds and participles (singing, sung). In many cases the use of such non-finite clauses tends to blur the boundary between superordinate and subordinate clauses. Compare for example:

Non-finite clauses

People in the region expect that the new high-speed railway will boost the local economy. People in the region expect the new high-speed railway to boost the local economy.

In the variant featuring the that-clause, the boundary between main and subordinate clause is clear, and so is the status of all constituents:

[people in the region expect [that [the new high-speed railway] [will boost [the local economy]]]]

The sequence that the new high-speed railway will boost the local economy is an embedded object clause dependent on the verb expect, and the new high-speed

SYNTAX II/THE FUNDAMENTALS OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR

railway is the subject of this finite clause. In the non-finite alternative construction, which basically means the same, there is, however, some ambiguity about the status of the new high-speed railway. In terms of meaning it seems to operate as the “subject” of the following infinitive, as the sentence does not really say that people in the region expect the railway but the effect resulting from its inauguration:
people in the region expect [the new high-speed railway to boost the local economy]
Assuming that the new high-speed railway is a subject and that the local economy is the object of boost, we can derive the following passive:
people in the region expect [the local economy to be boosted [by the new highspeed railway]]
This passive is in fact possible. However, in terms of form, the new high-speed railway looks exactly like any other object of expect, which suggests an alternative bracketing:
[people in the region expect the new high-speed railway] to boost the local economy
Assuming that the new high-speed railway is the object of expect, we can derive the following passive:
the new high-speed railway is expected to boost the local economy [by people in the region]
This passive is possible too. As we do not want to give up the “passive test” for determining objects which works so well otherwise, we are forced to draw the following conclusion. The construction which we are dealing with is a “fused” one in which one constituent has an unclear grammatical status, allowing two equally legitimate analyses. For the grammarian, this may be a messy situation, for speakers using the language in practice it allows freedom and flexibility, including the option of forming a compound passive of the following type:
The local economy is expected to be boosted by the new high-speed railway.
Similar analytical problems are posed by superficially similar structures such as the following:
She is looking for an au-pair speaking English and Portuguese. She found the au-pair reading her diary. She insisted on the au-pair staying in all evenings of the week.
In the first example, the participle clause speaking English and Portuguese can plausibly be replaced by a finite relative clause: who speaks English and Portuguese. The possibility of replacing one structure with another without

PROBLEMS AND CHALLENGES

Unit 5

a clear change in meaning is usually considered a grammatical test of functional equivalence. We are thus in a position to argue that the participle clause here functions as a relative clause. Such an analysis is ruled out in the other two cases, however. In she found the au-pair reading her diary, the participle clause (reading her diary) seems functionally equivalent to a complement of the object (she found the au-pair useless) or an adverbial (she found the au-pair in the kitchen), which suggests treating it as either an adverbial or as an objectcomplement clause. Either analysis badly fits the third example, in which the whole sequence the au-pair staying in all evenings of the week seems to function as one unit in replacement and question tests and is therefore best regarded as an object, realised as a non-finite clause. This essential unity can also be made explicit by putting the au-pair into the genitive – an option which is, incidentally, ruled out in the other two examples:

She insisted on it. What did she insist on? She insisted on the au-pair’s staying in all evenings of the week.

As in most other Units, students wishing to pursue these questions on the basis of corpora will find ample opportunity to do so. For example, corpus data often make clear where the subtle meaning differences are between competing patterns of complementation. For illustration, consider the following use of find (from a text about Keith Douglas’ poetry included in the F-LOB corpus):

Competing complementation patterns – semantic contrasts

His work involves both authenticating and statement-supporting sound-patterns, while his truly programmatic effects are subtle, much more so than, for example, those of Wilfred Owen. While we may feel some of his various effects, we need to dissect them and to work out how and where they connect with his meanings, and we may also try to guess which were conscious and which not. We shall find them to be far richer, more intricate, and more apposite, in certain poems, than can be appreciated in a single reading or hearing, or even in many.

Why find them to be? And not any of the possible alternatives, such as:

We shall find that they are far richer … We shall find them far richer …

Find that something is good/bad is a neutral statement of a fact, without any overtone of personal judgment. Find something good/bad, on the other hand, expresses a general or permanent opinion rather than a personal judgment on a specific occasion. And expressing such a personal judgment on a specific occasion is precisely what motivated the writer of this text to choose the original construction rather than any of its alternatives.

SYNTAX II/THE FUNDAMENTALS OF ENGLISH GRAMMAR

Competing complementation patterns – stylistic
contrasts

Sometimes, constructional variants differ from each other less in their semantic overtones than in their stylistic values, as markers of informal/spoken or as markers of formal/written usage. Informal spoken language, for example, is particularly rich in devices which help move material to the beginning or the end of an utterance for reasons of focus or emphasis. Compare, for example, the following two constructions with their more formal or “written” alternatives in brackets:

The fool, he did it again! (The fool did it again.) I find it very hard, remembering all the details. (I find remembering the details very hard./It is remembering the details that I find hard.)

Conversely, passives of the following type would be extremely unlikely to turn up in spontaneous speech but are typical for formal written textual genres, such as academic writing.

The new production process was shown to be industrially viable.

This can be shown easily by the systematic analysis of corpus data. The following diagram illustrates the frequency of the shown to-passive in various textual genres sampled in the British National Corpus:

The gradient could not be clearer: the natural sciences, at least with regard to this particular variable, represent the core area of science writing, with applied sciences/engineering following in (a distant) second position. The humanities and the social sciences are the other two genres which narrowly exceed the 12.59/1,000 000 average for written English. In the “imaginative” fiction texts, which are most closely modelled on speech, the construction is as infrequent as it is in the spoken language.

Unit 6
Semantics and lexicology – the meaning of words

Orientation

6.1

The major function of language in communication is the expression of meaning. Issues of meaning therefore play an important indirect role at all levels of linguistic description. For example, meaning contrasts were crucial in the definition of the phoneme in Unit 2, in which we defined phonemes as speech sounds capable of distinguishing meaning in minimal pairs. Similarly, contrasts between grammatical choices (e. g. past or present perfect, singular or plural, variation between competing patterns of complementation of verbs, etc.) usually imply contrasts of meaning.
Semantics (a term derived from semantikos, the Ancient Greek word for “meaningful”), by contrast, is the subdiscipline of linguistics which devotes itself directly and exclusively to the systematic study of meaning. In that, semantics is chiefly concerned with meaning at the level of the linguistic system, that is de-contextualised or potential meaning, rather than the contextually enriched meaning which arises in actual language use and which will be treated in the next Unit under the heading of “Pragmatics.”
To illustrate the difference in the way meaning is approached in semantics and pragmatics, consider the following conversational exchange which allegedly took place between a giant of 1960s beat music and a hostile interviewer:

The pervasive role of meaning in language and linguistic description
Semantics – meaning in focus in linguistic analysis
Semantics vs. pragmatics – abstract/ general vs. contextual meaning

Q: And what do you think of Mozart? A: I love his paintings.

Here a command of English grammar and a knowledge of the meaning of the words (i. e. their semantics) is only a first step towards an understanding of what is going on. All we can observe at that level is a well-formed request for information (“what do you think of …”), followed by an equally well-formed answer (“I love his paintings”). Indeed, the exchange is no different from:

Q: And what do you think of Hemingway? A: I really love The Old Man and the Sea.

Why then is it that we recognise the hostile intention behind the question and appreciate the elegant way in which the answer parries it? This is due to complex context-bound processes of reasoning which extend far beyond semantics and into the realm of pragmatics, the study of language in context or language in use. Then as now, educated contemporaries are supposed to know

that Mozart was a famous composer and not a painter and to esteem his work highly. A further assumption underlying the question, which was probably more wide-spread in the 1960s than it is now, is that pop music is barbaric and thus self-evidently inferior to Mozart. Given this context, an innocent-looking question turns out to be a hidden act of aggression.
In his answer, the rock musician uses an ironical strategy. He pretends a level of ignorance in cultural matters that is so enormous as to be unbelievable even in a rock musician and thereby puts the questioner in his place. The way from semantics to pragmatics is the way from a proposition (the abstract, de-contextualised logical content of a sentence) to an utterance situated in a discourse context, or from what is said to what is meant. What the semantic analysis of meaning describes is the abstract meaning that the words in a proposition, and the proposition as a whole, have out of context. The full, contextually enriched meaning of the utterance is analysed in pragmatics. Experience shows that in most acts of communication more is meant or implied in context than what is expressed at the propositional level, so that the way from what is said to what is meant can be a long and complicated one at times.
Within semantics, the central area of interest is lexical semantics, the study of the meaning of individual words. Strictly speaking, the unit of semantic description is the lexeme, the abstract entity subsuming the various inflectional forms of a word. The lexeme go thus comprises the word forms go, goes, going, went, gone. In spite of their contrasting grammatical potential, all these forms share the same meaning. In lexicography, the lexeme is often present as the lemma, i. e. the headword of an entry. Thus, we would not expect a dictionary to have a separate entry for the plural boys in addition to the singular boy, and if a grammatical variant of a word is included as an entry – for example – because it is irregular and therefore a learning problem, the reference would be to the main entry: the user looking up went would be referred to the entry for go.
The focus on lexical semantics does not mean that there are not semantic problems which must be addressed at the level of the clause or sentence (for example negation), but the lexicalisation of concepts as words is clearly the key to an understanding of how speakers “make sense” of the world around them in language. Word meaning is a central concern in two other sub-fields of linguistics, which partly overlap with semantics but are characterised by their own additional agenda, namely lexicology and lexicography. Lexicology covers aspects of lexical semantics, but in addition studies the morphological form and structural status of words. Lexicography, in its turn, could be said to be an applied branch of lexicology, as it is chiefly concerned with appropriate ways of representing meaning in dictionaries for various types of users. In that sense, it is a branch of applied linguistics.
Currently, two partly incompatible theoretical approaches dominate the field of lexical semantics – a structural one and a cognitive one. The aim of

ORIENTATION

Unit 6

the structural approach is to describe meaning as part of linguistic structure, whereas the cognitive approach is additionally concerned with the way meanings are perceived and processed by the human mind, as part of the human cognitive capacity.
The structural approach tends to handle complex lexical meanings by breaking them down into simpler components or features. Such features are conceived of as binary. That is their presence or absence can be determined easily, as in the following example:

Semantic features and the componential analysis of meaning

boy girl people person woman

[+ human], [– female], [– adult] [+ human], [+ female], [– adult] [+ human], [+ plural] [+ human], [+ adult] [+ human], [+ female], [+ adult]

Table 6.1 Componential analysis

This analysis claims that the difference between person and woman just resides in the presence of one such “atom” of meaning in the latter word and its absence in the former. If we add the feature [+ female] to the meaning of “person,” we get the more complex and specific meaning “woman,” whereas if we take out the feature [+ female] from “woman,” we’re left with “person.” (For [+ female], [– male] could of course be used, or vice versa.)
Semantic features are supposed to be general building blocks of the semantic universe of a language, so that they are useful for the semantic analysis of large numbers of individual words. For example, the features [male] and [female] help us in the analysis of many terms used to denote higher animals, such as bull and cow, or stallion and mare.
One limitation of the feature-based approach to meaning is that it forces binary decisions where ordinary life-experience would argue for gradual transitions or flexible and context-sensitive case-by-case judgments. On a binary analysis, for example, children and adolescents are summarily ruled out of the category “person” by assigning it the feature [+ adult]. The question is whether this is justified. Corpus data suggest that it may well be. These are the two relevant instances of the use of person from the British National Corpus:

Limitations of a feature-based approach to word meaning

SEMANTICS AND LEXICOLOGY – THE MEANING OF WORDS

Where the word person is used in conjunction with an attribute giving the age, it is clear that we are dealing with adults. We would not expect sentences such as the following:

? A three-year old person was observed scrawling paint all over the stair-case.

The definition of persons as [+ adult] thus seems robust and well justified, and the fact that we may occasionally waver in applying the designation to sixteenyear-olds is not a strong argument against the feature-based approach.
There are, however, cases for which such a feature-based semantic analysis does not merely run into the occasional minor problem but is impossible from the very start. A textbook example is the class of English words denoting containers for liquids (cup, mug, vase, bowl, jug, pot, ...) – an example first discussed in Labov 1973. Typical “features” which might be invoked in distinguishing cups, mugs and bowls might be:

Fig. 6.2 Cup
cup

1) size: cups are small, while mugs

are bigger

2) shape: cups are short and round

while mugs are tall and elongated

in shape, with a rectangular pro-

file

3) saucers: cups come with saucers

but mugs don’t

4) handles: both cups and mugs

teapot

have handles while bowls don’t

Fig. 6.3 Mug

On this theory, confronted with the

saucer

object represented in Fig. 6.2, we would recognise the feature combi-

nation “[+ small] [+ round profile]

[+ short] [+ saucer] [+ handle]” and

use the word cup. Fig. 6.3, on the

other hand, shows a “mug,” because

the features are combined different-

ly.

However, it is easy to see that this

approach will take us only so far. For

one thing, the first two “features” –

size and shape – are not binary but

gradient. What would be the appro-

priate name for the following object,

for example?

If it stood five inches tall, we

would probably refer to it as a mug,
