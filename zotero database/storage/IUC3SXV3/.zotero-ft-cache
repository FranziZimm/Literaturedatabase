Syntax, Semantics, and Pragmatics of Contexts

Abstract. Thenotion of context is indispensable in discussions of meaning,but the wordcontext has often beenusedin conflicting senses. In logic, the first representation of context as a formalobject was by the philosopherC. S. Peirce; but for nearly eighty years, his treatment wasunknowonutside a small group of Peirce aficionados. In the early 1980s,three newtheories included related notions of context: Kamp’sdiscourse representation theory; Barwiseand Perry’s situation semantics; and Sowa’sconceptual graphs, which explicitly introduced Peirce’s approach to the AI community.More recently, John McCarthaynd his students have begunto use a closely related notion of context as a basis for organizing and partitioning knowledgebases. Eachof the theories has distinctive, but complementaryideas that can enrich the others, but the relationships betweenthemare far fromclear. This paper analyzes the semanticfoundations of these theories and showshowMcCarthy’sist(c,p) predicate can be interpreted in terms of the semanticnotions underlyingthe others.

1. Theoriesof Contexts
In the AI literature, the term context has been applied to a profusionof ideas that havenot been clearly distingafished. Someof themconcern the syntactic representation of contexts; others refer to the semanticrelationship of a linguistic context to a physical situation; and still others introduce pragmatic notions concerning the purpose or use of a context in various applications. Each of these major areas can be subdivided further. Syntactically, there are three distinct aspects of context:
1. Amechanismfor grouping, associating, or packaging information that can be named and referencedas a single unit.
2. The contents of that package, which have been called anything from quoted formula to microtheory.
3. The permissible operations on the information in the package and the constraints on importing and exporting information into and out of a package.
All three of these notions represent syntactic mechani.mls for representing and manipulating logical formulas without any consideration of their relationship to the real world, a possible world, or somemodel of the world. Muchof the controversy about contexts results from the lack of a formalsemanticsthat relates these operations to a Tarski-style model. Even an informal semantics that displays the intuitive meaningof contexts in terms of real-world objects and situations would be helpful as a guide to further analysis and formaliTation.

Someof the confusiaobnout contexts results from an ambiguity in the English word. Dietionaries list two major senses of the word context:.
¯ Thebasic meaningis a section of the linguistic text or discourse that surrounds some wordor phrase of interest.
¯ The derived meaz~gis a nonlingnistic situation, environment, domain, setting, background, or milieu that includes someentity, subject, or topic of interest.
Thesetwo informal senses suggest intuitive criteria for distinguishing the various functions of contexts:
¯ Syntax. Thesyntactfiucnction of context is to group, delimit, or package "a section of linguistic text." Formally, a context behaves like the QUOToEperator in Lisp together with the parentheses that delimit the portion of text that is quoted.
¯ Semantics. The quoted text of a context refers to something, which maybe a physical entity or situation, a mathematical construction, or someother expression in a natural or artificial language.
¯ Pragmatics. The wordinterest, which occurs in both senses of the English definition, suggests somereason or purposefor distinguishing "a section of linguistic text" or "a nonlinguistie situation." That purpose constitutes the pragmatiesor the reason whythe text is being quoted. In Lisp, the QUOTE operator blocks the execution of the standard Lisp interpreter to allow nonstandard oper-

85

ations to be performed for someother purpose. In logic, a quote blocks the standard rules of inference and allowsthe definition of newrules for somespecial purpose.
As this analysis indicates, the notion of context is intimately connectedwith a complexof related ideas. Muchof the confusion results from which of them happens to be called a context:, some people apply the wordto the package; and others to the information contained in the package, to the thing that the informationis about, or to the possible uses of either the information or the thing. The ideas themselves maybe compatible, but they must be carefully distinguished and sorted out.
Theseintuitive criteria provide a basis for analyzing John McCarthy’s (1993) "Notes Formalizing Context" and relating the ideas to the other theories. McCarthy’sbasic notation is the predicate ist(c,p), which maybe read "the propositionp is true in context c." In his dissertation written under McCarthy’sdirection, R. V. Guha(1991) applied McCarthy’sapproach to the problem of partitioning a large, monolithic knowledgebase into a collection of smaller, more modular microtheories. Guha implemented the microtheories in the Cycsystem (I.gnat & Guha 1990), in which they have becomea fundamental mechanism for organizing and stnmturing a knowledge base. McCarthy and Buva~ (1994) have also applied contexts and the /st predicate to the analysis and representation of natural languagediscourse.
Although McCarthy, Guha, and Buva~ have shownthat the /st predicate can be a powerful tool for building knowledgebases and analyzing discourse, they havenot clearly distinguished the syntax of contexts and propositions from their semantic relationship to some domain of discourse. In fact, the ist predicate itself mixesthe syntactic notion of containment(~s-in) with the semanticnotion of truth (/s-true-of). Toclarify these relationships, it maybe helpful to analyze the ist predicate as a conjunction of three more primitive predicates, ~s-in, refers-to, and describes:
ist(c,p-)-(~3x:Entity)(is-in(c,p)
refers-to(c^,dxe)scribes(x,p)).
Accordingto this analysis, the proposition p is true in context e ff and only if there exists some entity x such that p is in c, c refers to x, and p describes x. The formula distinguishes the abstract context c fromsomenonlingulstic entity x, which represents the "situation, environment, domain,setting, background,or milieu" assoei-

ated with c. The predicate ~s-in represents the syntactic relationship of c to p; andthe predicates refers-to anddescribes represent the semanticre-
lationships of c and p to the external entity x. McCarthy, Guha, and Buva~ have primarily considered the syntactic operations associated with the ~s-in componenotf the ist predicate. To justify those operations, the semantics of the
refers-to and describes componentsmust also be addressed.
Muchof the controversy about contexts resuits from the abundanceof notation and terminologyin different theories, their application to diverse phenomena, and the lack of commlmi-
cation betweenthe different schools of thought. The purpose of this paper is to emphasize the underlying similarities and to promote crossfertilization of ideas. Thefollowingfive theories will be considered:
1. Charles Sanders Peirce (1885) invented the modernalgebraic notation for predicate calculus; but a dozenyears later, he developed
an alternate notation, which he called existential graphs (Roberts 1973). Although Peirce’s algebra and graphs had equivalent expressivepower,the graphicstructure served as a heuristic aid that led himto explore op-
erations and applications that were overlooked by logicians who used only the algebraic notation. In particular, Peirce’s graphic notation for contexts was isomorphic to the discourse representation structures (DRSs)invented by Hans Kampeighty years later. His rules of inference were based on operations of iterating anddeiterating information to and from contexts in a waythat resemblesJohn McCarthy’slifting rules.
2. Hans Kamp(1981) developed discourse representation theory (DRT)to express the logical constraints on anaphofic references in natural language. Becauseof the difficulty of expressing those constraints in the algebraic notation for logic, Kampintroducedthe graphic DRSnotation, which allowed a tim-
pler formulation of his rules. Si~iBcantly, the nested contexts in Kamp’s DRSsare isomorphicto the nestof contexts in Peirce’s EGs, even though Kamphad no previous knowledgeof them. Kampdeserves credit for discovering the constraints on anaphora in DRT,but DRSsand EGs are equally suitable for expressingthose constraints.
3. Jon Barwise and John Perry (1983) developed situation semantics as a theory of meaning in natural langq_~age. Unlike

86

Montague’sapproach (1975), which related the semanticsof languageto potentially infinite models of the real world or possible worlds, Barwiseand Perry adopted finite situations as their basis. Each situation is a bounded region of space-time containing physical objects and processes, as well as other situations. Agreat deal of research has been done within the paradigm of situation semantics(Barwiseet al. 1991), including efforts to mergeit or at least reconcile it with DRT (Cooper & Kamp 1991). An important question is howand whether it can be mergedor reconciled with McCarthy’s contexts as well.
John Sowa (1984) developed conceptual . graphs as a system of logic and reaching
based on the semantic networks of AI and the existential graphs of C. S. Peirce. The nodes called concepts correspond to typed, quantified variables in a sorted predicate calcaius. A context is a defined as a concept of type Proposition, whosereferent field contains one or more conceptual graphs that state the proposition. Later papers (Sowa Way1986; Sowa1991) used the CGcontexts to represent Kamp’sDRSsand Barwise and Perry’s situations. In a paper on "Crystallizing Theories out of KnowledgeSoup," Sowa
(1990) proposedthe use of contexts for partitioning a knowledgebase into a collection
of smaller "chunks" that could be assembled into theories appropriate to any particular application. In his dissertation, Guha(1991) cited the knowledge soup paper, which he said was"in the samespirit as the workdescribed in this document."

5. John McCarthyis one of the foundingfathers of AI, whose collected work (McCarthy 1990) has frequently inspired and sometimes revolutionized the application of logic to knowledge representation. His work on context, although published later than the previous four approaches, has grownout of ideas based on his earlier work. McCarthy’s /st predicate is the key to relating that work to the ongoing research in the other paradisnns. If the/st predicate can be defined
in termsof the other theories, then anyresults obtained in one approach can be translated
to any of the others. Besides defining contexts, McCarthyhas been emphasizing his lifting rules for importingand exporting information into and out of the quoted text or package. Suchrules, whichresemble Peirce’s
rules of iteration and deiteration, are essential for allowing quoted information to be unquoted and used.
Besidesthese five theories, there is a long history
of related ideas in logic, philosophy,linguistics, and AI. The most important ones for a theory of context include indexicals, possible worlds, metalanguage, belief revision, and ontology revision. Yet the various ideas and theories were developed by people with different intuitions, which they applied to different problems of knowledgerepresentation. Trying to unify and clarify those intuitions by defining the terms of one theory in those of another runs the risk of distorting the insights of both. This paper will explore the implications of these definitions to determinewhetherthe benefits of unification and clarification outweighany possible distortions of
the original in~ghts.

2. Peirce’s Contexts
First-order predicate calculus was independently invented by Gottlob Frege (1879) and Charles SandersPeirce (1885). Fregeused a tree notation, which no one else ever adopted. But Peirce developed an algebraic notation, whichthrough the textbook by Ernst Schr6der (1890) and with change of symbols by C-iuseppe Peano became the modemsystem of predicate calculus. Long before Bertrand Russell learned logic fromFrege and Peano, it had becomea flourishing subject based on the Peirce-Schr6der foundations.
Theearly history of modemlogic is a fascinating tale that has been recounted by Roberts (1973) and Houseret al. (1995). Themainpoint for this paper is that the manwhoinvented the

commoanlgebraic notation for logic later aban-
doned it for a graph representation, which he called his "chef d’oeuvre"and "the luckiest find of mycareer." Withthe existentialgraphs that he invented in 1897, Peiree developed an aspect of logic that waslargely ignored by the mathematical logicians of the twentieth century. In relating Peirce’s later logic and philosophy to situation semantics, Burke(1991) said "Peiree anticipated in his ownwaysomeof the concerns of situation
theory (or rather, he happenedto be workingbefore it went out of fashion to wrestle with such concerns)." A century later, those concerns are back in fashion, and Peirce is once again in the avant garde of modemlogic.

The three primitives of existential graphs
(EGs) include the ova/enclosure, which delimits a context, the line of identity, whichcorresponds to an existentially quantified variable, and
juxtaposition, whichrepresents conjunction. The default interpretation of an oval with no other

qualifiers is negation of the graphsnested inside. Existence, conjunction, and negation provide a completerepresentationfor all of first-order logic. As an example, the middle diagram in Figure 1 is an existential graphfor the sentenceIf a farmer ownsa donkey,then he beats it.

The notation that comesclosest is the partitioned semanticnetwork by GaryHendrix(1975), whichis illustrated the rightmost diagram of Figure 1. l.ike Peirce and Kamp, Hendrix took the existential quantifier as the default, represented conjunction by juxtaposition, and used a graphic enclosure for

natural languages has a moredirect mappingto
the Peirce-Kamp nested contexts than to Hendrix’soverlapping contexts. Kamp’srules for resolving anaphom in DRSscould be stated equally well in terms of EGs,but not in terms of
overlapping contexts.
Besides notation, Peirce defined rules of inference for EGs, whichin manyrespects are the simplest and most elegant inference rules ever devised for any version of logic. Atypical theorem that requires 43 steps to prove with Russell and Whitehead’srules of 1910takes only 8 steps
with Peirce’s rules of 1897. Peirce’s roles are a generalization of natural deduction, which GerhardGentzendiscovered 40 years later, l.ike Gentzen, Peirce took the emptyset as his only axiom, but Peirce’s proofs are simpler than Gentzen’sbecause the nesting of contexts elimi-
nates the bookkeeping needed for making and discharging assumptions -- the most error-prone aspect of Gentzen’s system. For further dis-

cussion of these points, see Roberts (1973), Sow^
(1984, 1993), and Houseret al. (1995).
In discussing modality, Peiree imagined the graphs drawn on "a book of separate sheets,
tacked together at points." The upper sheet represents "a universeof existing individuals," while the other sheets "represent altogether different universes with which our discourse has to do." Graphson those sheets mayrepresent "conceived propositions whichare not realized." Peirce said that a necessarily true proposition could be considered as replicated on aUthe sheets in the book, while a possible proposition might occur on only
one. In the algebraic notation, Peirce used the symbolco as an index for "a state of things," to
whichhe applied a universal quantifier for necessity and an existential quantifier for possibility. Withhis interpretation of necessity as truth "under all circumstances," Peirce was following
Leibniz and anticipating Kripke.

Figure2. EGfor "Youcanleada horseto water~butyoucan’t makehimdrink."

In 1906, Peirce introducedcolors or tinctures to represent modalities. Figure 2 shows one of Peirce’s examples,but with shadinginstead of the original red for possibility. The graph contains
four ovals: the outer two are associated to form a scroll for if-then; the inner tworepresent possi-
bility (shading) and impossibility (shading inside a negation). Theouter oval maybe read If there exists a person, a horse, andwater;, the next oval maybe read then it is possible for the personto lead the horseto the waterandnot possible for the personto makethe horse drink the water.
The notation leads to represents the triadic predicate leads-to(’x~v,z), and _makes_drinkr_epresents makes-drink(x~v,z).In the algebraic notation with 0 for possibility, Figure 2 mapsto
the following formula:

~(3x)(3y)(3z)(person(x) horse~) ^ water(z) ~(Oleads-to(x,y,z) ^ ~Omakes-drink(x,y,z) )
Withthe symbol= for implication, this formula becomes
(Vx)(¥y)(Vz) ((person(x) ^ water(z)()Oleads-to(x,y,z) ^ ~ ~makes-dnkr(ix,y,z) ).
This version maybe read For all x, y, andz, if x is a person,y is a horse, andz is water, thenit is possible for x to lead y to z, andnot possible for x to makey drink z.
Asa systematic wayof representing the kinds of contexts, Peirce adopted the traditional heraldic tinctures, whichwereclassified as metal, color, or fur. He applied that three-way distinct.ion to actual, modal, and intentional contexts:

89

1. Metal: argent, or, fer, and plomb. Peirce used argent (white background)for "the actual or true in a general or ordinary sense,"
and the other metallic tinctures for "the actual or true in somespecial sense." Astate-
ment about the physical world, for example, wouldbe actual in an ordinary sense. Peirce also considered mathematicalidealizations, suchas Cantor’shierarchyof infinite sets, to be "actual," but not in the samesense as ordinaryphysicalentities.

2. Color: azure, gules, vert, and purpure. Peirce distinguished four basic modalities: azure for logical possibility (dark blue) and subjective
possibility (light blue); gules for objective possibility; vert for "what is in the interrogative mood";and purpure for "free-
domor ability." Each of these modalities could be combinedwith negation: he defined necessaryin the usual wayas not-possibly-not
and obligatory as not-freedom-not(an anticipation of deonticlogic).

3. Fur: sable, ermine,vair, and potent. Thefour

furs correspond to propositional attitudes:

sab/e for "the metaphysically,or rationally,

or secondarily necessitated"; erm/nefor pur-

pose or intention; vair for "the

commarlded";

and potent for "the

compelled."

Peirce’s three-wayclassification is highly suggestive, but incomplete. He wrote that the complete classification of "all the conceptionsof logic" was "a labor for generations of analysts, not for one." But throughout his analyses, he clearly distinguished the logical operators represented by the graphs, fromthe tinctures, which, he said, do
not represent
differences of the predicates, or
significations of the graphs, but of the predetermined objects to which the graphs are intended to refer. Consequently, the Iconic idea of the System requires that they should be represented,
not by differentiatiom of the Graphs themselves but by appropriate visible characters of the surfaces uponwhichthe Graphs are marked.

It seemsthat Pcirce did not considerthe tinctures to be part of logic itself, but of the metalangua~ for describing howthe logic applies to the universe of discourse:

The nature of the universe or universes of discourse (for several maybe referred to in a single assertion) in the rather un-

usual cases in whichsuch precision is required, is denoted either by using modifications of the heraldic tinctures, markedin something like the usual manner inpale ink uponthe surface, orby scribing the graphs in colored inks.

By 1906, mathematical logic based on

Peirce’s algebraic notation had becomea flour-

ishing field of research, and his graphswere ig-

nored. Therewereseveral reasonsfor the neglect:

the notation and terminology were unfamiliur;

most logicians, whohad a strong backgroundin

mathematics, had already foundthe algebraic

notation congenial to their tastes; and si~if-

icantly, Peirce’s novel applications of his graph

logic to modality, intentionality,

and

metalangn,~ were outside the main interests of

the logicians of his time. Today, however,

Peirce’s contributions are central to research on

contexts:

1. Representationof contexts by nests of enclosures, which separate or partition groups of
propositions of different modalstatus.

2. First-order logic based on three operators: existence (line of identity), conjunction (juxtaposition), and negation (oval enclosure on a white background).

3. Sound and complete rules of inference for first-order logic basedon operations of drawing or erasing graphs and importing or exporting graphs into and out of contexts.

4. Tinctures for distingmishing the purpose or "nature" of a context fromits logical operators (for whichhe used only the basic three -- existence, conjunction, and negation).

5. Athree-wayclassification of the use of contexts for representing actuality (metal), modality(color), or intentionality (fur).

6. The use of graphs as a metalanguage for talking about graphs.

7. Completestatement of the rules of inference for existential graphs in existential graphs themselves.

Peirce’s later writings, althoughfragmentary,incomplete, and mostly unpublished, are no more fragmentary and incomplete than many modem publications about contexts. Although(or perhaps because) he did not use the word context, Peiree wasmoreconsistent in distinguishing the syntax (oval enclosures), the semantics("the universe or universes of discourse"), and the prag-
matics (the tinctures that "denote" the "nature" of those universes).

3. Contextsin ConceptualGraphs

Conceptuaglraphsareextensionosf existential ¯ graphs with new features based on the semantic networks of AI and the linguistic research on thematic roles and generalized quantifiers. The primary difference is in the treatment of lines of identity. In existential graphs, the lines serve two different purposes: they represent existential quantifiers, and they show how the arguments are connected to the relations. In conceptual graphs, those two functions are split: boxes called concepts contain the quantifiers, and arcs marked ¯ with arrows show the connections of arguments to circles called conceptual relations. This separation of functions has several important consequences:
¯ Concepthsavea placetorepresenattypelabel for eachquantifierC.onceptuaglraphs thereforecorrespontdo a typedor sorted logic,unlikteheuntypeedxistentigarlaphs.

The arrows or numbers on the arcs of conceptual relations distinguish the arguments more clearly than Peirce’s unlabeled lines.
For dyadic relations, the arrow pointing towards the circle is the first argument, and the arrow pointing away is the second argument. For relations with more than two arguments,
the arcs are numberedl, 2 ..... n; the arrow on the n-th arc points away from the circle, and the other arcs point towards the circle.
In an existential graph, any point on a line of identity could be considered as a separate quantified variable. Conceptual graphs concentrate the point of quantification in the concepts rather than the lines. A blank referent field represents the quantifier 3, but the universal quantifier V or other generalized quantifiers mayalso occur in the referent field of a concept.

referent field.
¯ When an existential graph or an tmtyped formula in predicate calculus is mappedto a conceptual graph, the type label r may be used to mark the universal type, which is a supertype of all others. The type T imposes no restrictions on the quantifier or referent.
The concept [T: Yojo], for example,would
represent an entity named Yojo whose type was unknown or unspecified.

To illu~t~ette these features, Figure 3 shows two equivalent conceptual graphs for the donkey sentence. The CGonthe left uses the basic notation with the -’ symbol to mark negation and with dotted lines for coreference links. The CGon the right uses an extended notation with the types If and Then defined as negated propositions and with coreference shown by the labels x and y. The concepts marked *x and *y are the defining nodes with implicit existential quanfifiers, and the concepts marked ?x and ?y are bound nodes within the scope of *x and *y.

This discussion raises a question about the distinction betweena total description of everything that is knowableabout a situation and a partial description in a single formula. That issue has

been central to situation semantics, which may
help to clarify the semanticsof both CGcontexts and McCarthy’scontexts.

4. Situations andPropositions
Barwiseand Perry (1983) developedsituation semanticsas a reaction again~the potentially infinite models of Kripke’s and Montague’s modal and intensional logics. Eachsituation is a finite configuration of some aspect of the world in a limited region of space and time. It maybe a static configuration that remainsunchangedfor a period of time, or it mayinclude processes and events that are causing changes. It mayinclude peopleand things with their actions and thoughts; it maybe real or imaginary; and its time maybe present, past, or future. A situation maybe as large as the solar systemor as small as an atom, and it maycontain nested situations for smaller or moredetailed aspects of the world.

Asan illustration of the waysituations are related to partial descriptions, Figure 5 showsa conceptof type Situation, whichis linked to two images and a description. The image relation (IMAGl)inks the situation to twodifferent kinds of imagesof that situation: a picture and the assoeiated sound. The description relation (DSCR) links it to a proposition that desc~bessomeaspect of the situation, which is linked by the
statement relation (STMT)to three different statements of the proposition in three different
languages: an E~gllsh sentence, a conceptual graph, and a formula in the KnowledgeRepresentation Lang~ (KIF) by Genesereth and Fikes (1992).

A proposition maybe defined as an equivalence class of statements in one or more languages. Noconcrete statement in any specific language /s the proposition. Instead, a concept of type Proposition, such as the one in Figure 5, represents a class of intertranslatable statements in one or moreconcrete languages. Each statement in that class is said to express the same

proposition. To avoid complexities, the equivalence mappingwill be defined first for formal languages like KIF and CGs. Letfbe a mapping from language M1to language~2 that defines the equivalence;let s be any statementin "~1; and let
t =fl-l(](s)) be the result of mappings 2 and back again. Thenfmustobey the following three constraints:

93

1. Truth preserving: The statements s and t mustbe provably equivalent according to the rules of inference of language~1-
2. Vocabulary preserving: Exactly the same nonlogical symbols must appear in both s and t.
3. Negation preserving: Whens and t axe mapped to Peirce Normal Form (with negation, conjunction, and the existential quantifier as the only logical operators), they contain exactly the samenumberof negation operators.
Thesethree conditions ensure that the statements s and t axe highly similar, if not identical. Although Fermat’s Last Theoremand 2 + 2 = 4 are both true, the proof is far fromtrivial, and the two statements require different vocabularies. Condition #2 allows variables to be renamedand permits pvq to be replaced by ~(~p^"q); but ensures that a statement like (Vx)(dog(x)=dog(x)) does not get mapped to (Vx)(cat(x)~cat(x)). Condition #3 allows pap to be mappedto p, but it prevents ~~p from being mappedto p. Generalizing this definition to natural languages should be possible, but that wouldraise further issues beyondthe scope of this paper.
As Figure 5 illustrates, the proposition stated by any of the three statements represents a tiny fraction of the total information available. Both the sound image and the picture image capture information that is not in the sentence, but even they are only partial representations. A picture maybe worth a thousand words, but a situation can be worth a thousand pictures. To relate a situation to the information it contains, Keith Devlin (1991) introduced the term infon for an abstract informationobject that is closely related to the previous definition of proposition.
Devlin’s basic formula is s ~ o, wheres is a situation and o is an infon that is semantically entailed by s. Devlin’s constructithoant comes

closest to what McCarthycalls a context is the set of all infons entailed by a situation: {o [ s No}. If the DSCRrelation is interpreted as entailment of a partial description, McCarthy’s context c may be considered a complete description of a situation:
completeDscr(s,c) = c= {a [ s N ~r}.
For Figure 5, the context c wouldinclude propositions or infons saying that the plumber is carrying a toolbox, he works for AcmePlumbing Co., he is draggingthe pipe with a clanketynoise, etc. Thepredicate is-in(c,p) could then be interpreted as provability.
Withthis analysis, the following formularepresents an interpretation of the /st predicate in terms of situations and infons (or propositions):
i st(c,p-)(3s:Situation)(provable(c,p) completeDscr(^sd,s¢c)r(s,p)).
Thesyntactic predicateis-in(c,p) is interpreted as provable(c,p). The two semantic predicates are
definedin termsof entailmentr:efers-to(c,s)
completeDscr(s,c); and dser(s,p) is s ~p. In pure first-order framework, s ~p wouldbe redundant, since it wouldbe implied by c [--p and the definition of c. Including it, however,could accommodate nonstandard logics in which provability is not equivalent to entailment.
The previous definition was presented at the IJCAI’95 workshop on context. In the diseussions, McCarthymadethe point that identifying a context c with the set of all entailments of a situation s does not completely capture his intuitions about context. As aa example, suppose that John believes everything that Marybelieves. Theneither of their belief systems would entail exactly the same propositions. But McCarthywould like to say that the context of John’s beliefs is not the sameas the context of Mary’sbeliefs. That distinction implies that no purely extensional definition can capture the full import of McCarthy’snotion of context.

5. Extensions,Intensions, andIntentions
The difficulty of giving a precise definition of McCarthy’csontexts is closely related to the difficulty of giving a precise definition of situations. In their 1983book, Barwiseand Perry identified a situation with a boundedregion of space-time, and they tried to use that definition to support a theory of propositional attitude verbs, such as believe, think, hope, fear, wish, want, and plan. Yet further research on situation semantics has

shownthat a purely extensional definition of situation is inadequate, for manyof the samereasons that McCarthyobjected to an extensional definition of context. Thefollowing examplesillustrate the problems:
¯ A college lecture mightbe considered a situation boundedby a 50-minute time perioidn a spatial region enclosed by the walls of a classroom. But if the time were movedfor-

94

wardby 30 minutes, the region wouldinclude the last half of one lecture and the first half of another. That time shift wouldcreate a very unnatural "situation."
¯ An even more unnatural transformation wouldbe to shift the spatial regionto the left by half the width of a classroom. Then it wouldinclude part of one class listening to one teacher, part of another class listening to
a different teacher speaking on a different topic, and a wall that separated the two discussions.
¯ Anotherpossible tranfformation is to fix the coordinate systemrelative to the sun instead of the earth. Thenthe space-time region that included the class at the beonningof the lecture wouldquickly shift into deep space as the earth moved;by the end of the hour, it wouldcontain nothing but an occasional hydrogen atom.
Theseexamplesillustrate a fundamentaldifficulty for any purely extensional definition. Anarbitrarily chosenspace-timeregion is useless for defining a "situation" or "context." Instead, a useful or "meaningful" choice of region depends critically on someagent’s purpose or intention. Butif purposeor intention is critical to the deftnition of situation or context, then the explication of propositional attitudes in terms of situations
becomescircu,!~: the intentionality that is explained by the theory depends on the intentionality that wentinto the choice of situ-
ation.
Peirce considered intentionality as funda-
mental to his theory of signs or semiotics. Although he did not use the wordcontext, he would have defined a context as a kind of sign, to which he wouldapply his basic definition:
A sign, or representamen, is something which stands to somebodyfor something in somerespect or capacity. It addresses somebodyt,hat is, creates in the mindof
that person an equivalent sign, or perhaps a more developed sign. That sign whichit creates I call the interpretant of the first sign. The sign stands for something, its object. It stands for that object, not in all respects, but in reference to a sort of idea, which I have sometimes called the ground of the representamen.
(CP 2.228)

Peirce’s notion of sign was broad enoughto include situations, contexts, propositionsor infons, and their expression in any language, including English and logic. His notion ofgroundiscrucial: it acknowledgesthat someagent’s purpose, intention, or "conception"is essential for determiningthe scopeof a situation or context.
Unlikethe two-waydistinction of extensions and intensions, Peirce drew a three-way distinction in his basic categories of Firstness, Secondness, and Thirdness:
First is the conceptionof being or existhag independent of anything else. Second is the conceptionof beingrelative to, the conception of reaction with, something else. Third is the conception of mediation, wherebya first and a second are broughtinto relation.
His three kinds of tinctured contexts, whichwere discussed in Section 2, are applications of these categories:
1. Metal represents the "Actual" or what can be described in classical first-order logic withoutmodalities or intentionality.
2. Colorrepresents the varieties of possibilities, objective, subjective, and deontic. This topic has been thoroughly explored in the modem modaland intensional logics, whosesemantics have been defined in terms of infinite families of possible worlds.
3. Fur represents the intentionality (with a instead of an S) whereby an agent selects somecontext for the representation of some object for somepurpose. Intentionality, in Peirce’s terms, is the mediating Thirdness that determinesthe context for directing attention to someobject for somepurpose.
Peirce’s third category has never been ad~uately studied or represented in any of the modern modaland intensional logics. It is central to the issues that McCarthy, Baxwise and Perry, and others have been trying to capture in their theodes. But those theories cannot be completed without representing intentionality with a T. Peirce never completed his theory of intentionality, but at least he madea goodbeginning. As he said, the completeclassification of all the conceptionsis "a labor for generations of analysts, not for one."
