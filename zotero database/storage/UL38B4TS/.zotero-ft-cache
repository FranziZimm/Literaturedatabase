Note
Early versions of Chapters 1 , 3 , 4, and 5 of this book were w ri tten in Italian as entries of the Enciclopedia Einaudi; however, these have been reworked and rewritten for the p u rposes of this book. Slightly diffe rent versions of the following chapters have already been published in E ng­ lish: "Signs" (Chapter I), as "The Sign Revisited ," translated by Lucia Re , Philosophy and Social Criticism 7 ( 1 980); "Metaphor" (Chapter 3 ) , as "The Scandal of Metaphor," translated by Christopher Paci, Poetics Today 3 ( 1 982); " Isotopy" (Chapter 6), as part of the article "Two P rob­ lems in Textual Interpretation," Poetics Today Ia ( 1 980) . An earlier ver­ sion of " M i rrors" (Chapter 7) was w ritten for a vol u m e i n honor of Thomas A . Sebeok for his sixty-fifth birthday. The translators men­ tioned above a re not responsible for the changes i n the final versions.
Figure 3-5 of this book is adapted from Groupe p.,, Rhetorique generate (Paris: Larousse, 1 970) , p . 1 09. Figu re 6. I of this book is reprinted from Umberto Eco, The Role of the Reader (Bloomi ngto n : I n diana U niversity Press, 1 979) , p . 1 4 .
I n the course of this book, I u s e (as I d i d in A Theory o f Semiotics) single slashes to ind icate expressions; gu illemets i n d icate the corre­ sponding content. Thus /x/ means, or is an expression for, <<X». How­ ever, when it is not strictly necessary to stress such a distinction (that is, when words or sentences are used as expressions whose corresponding content is taken as intu i tively u n de rs tood) , I s i m ply use i talics.
All the s u bj ects d ealt with i n this book have been widely d iscussed d u ring the last fou r years i n my cou rses at the University of Bologna and d u ring my visiting terms at Yale University and Columbia University; many of the topics were also elabora te d in the cou rse of various congres­ ses, symposia, semi nars - in so many circumstances that it would be difficu lt to be honest and exhaustive in expressing my gratitu d e to all those students and colleagues who have contributed to the original d raft with their o bj ections and suggestions. I a m , however, particularly in­ debted to Barbara Spackman and John Deely, who have kindly revised part of the chapte rs .

Semiotics and the Philosophy of Language

[0]
INTRO D UCTI ON
0.1. The empi rical reader of this book could have the impression that its various chapters deal with two theoretical objects , mutually incompati­ ble, each being focused on as the o bj ect of a general semiotic approach: the sign, or the sign-function, and semiosis. The sign is usually consid­ ered as a correlation between a signifier a n d a signified (or between ex­ pression and content) and therefore as an action between pairs . Semiosis is, according to Peirce, "an action , or influence, which is, o r i nvolves , an o peration of three subj ects , such as a sign, i ts object, and i ts i n terpretant, this tri-relative influence not being i n any way resolvable into an action between pairs" (C. P. 5 . 484) .
The Model Reader should (as I hope) u nderstand that the aim of this book is to show that these two notions are not incompatible. If one thinks of the more trivial and current notion of linguistic sign, one can­ not match a theory of semiosis as indefinite interpretation w i th a 'doc­ trine of signs' ; in this case, one has to choose either a theory-of the sign or a theory of semiosis (or of the significant practice, of the communica­ tive p rocesses , of textual and discurs ive activi ty) . However, the main purpose of this book is to show that such an alternative is a misleading o ne: the sign is the origin of the semiosic processes , and there is no opposition between the 'nomadism' of semiosis (and of interpretive ac­ tivi ty) and the alleged s tiffness and i m mobility of the sign . The concept of s ign must be d isentangled from i ts trivial identification with the idea of coded equivalence and identi ty ; the semiosic process of interpretation is present a t the very core of the concept of sign .
Chapter I ( "Signs" ) shows that this idea was clearly s pelled out by the
[1]

classical doctrines where the semeion was not considered as a n equiva­ lence bu t as an infere nce .
Chapte r 7 ( " M irrors") tackles the ques tion of a threshold between semiotic and presem iotic phenomena. The phe nGmenology of our expe­ rience with mirror images rep resents the experimentum crucis for testing the role played by two fundame ntal characteristics of any sem iosic expe­ rience : a sign is an x s tanding for a y which is absent, and the process w hich leads the i n terp re ter from x to y is of an infere n tial nature .
Defi nition i s the subject matter o f Chapter 2 ( "Dictionary v s . E ncy­ clopedia"), from the allegedly Aristotelian model called the Porphyrian Tre e to the c o n t e m p o ra ry d i s c u s s io n s on the p o s s i b i l i ty of a n e ncyclopedia-like representation o f o u r semantic competence. In this chapter, the curre nt opposition 'dictionary/encyclopedia' is traced back to the cl a ssi c al mo d e l s o f the tree and the l a b y ri n t h . /Tree/ and /labyrinth/ are not me taphors . They are topological and logical models , and as such they were and are studied in their proper domain. However, I have no difficulties i n admi tting that, as labels or emblems for the ove rall discussion developed in the various chapters of this book, they can be taken as metaphors . As such, they stand for the nonmetaphoric Peircean notion of unlimited semiosis and for the Model Q ou tlined i n A Theory of Semiotics ( E co 1 976).
If texts can be prod uced and inte rpre ted as I suggested i n The Role of the Reader ( E co 1 979) , i t is because the universe ofsemiosis can be postu­ l a te d i n the format of a labyri n th . The reg u l a tive hypo thesis of a semiosic universe structure d as a labyrinth governs the approach to o ther classical issues such as metaphor, symbol, and code.
Me taphors can be read according t o multiple interpre tations; y e t these interpre tations can be more or less legitimate d on the grounds of an underlying e ncyclopedic competence. In this sense, Chapter 3 ( "Metaphor" ) aims at improving some of the proposals of my essay "The Semantics of Me taphor" (Eco 1 979, c h . 2), where the image of the Swedish stall-bars req u i red a more rigorous explanation in terms of a rep resentable e ncyclopedic network.
The notion of symbolic mode outlined in Chapter 4 ( "Symbol") ac­ counts for all these cases of textual p roduction that do not rely o n a p reestablished portion of e ncyclopedia but inve n t and p ropose for the first time a new in terpre tive connection .

o. :z .
The p rinciple of i n terpretation says that "a s ign is something by know­ ing which we know something more" (Peirce). The Peircean idea of semiosis is the idea of an infinite process of inte rp re tation . I t seems that the symbolic mode is the paramount example of this possibility .

Introd uction

[3]

However, interpreta tion is not red ucible to the responses elicited by the textual strategies accorded to the symbolic mode. The interpretation of metaphors shifts from the u n ivocality of catachreses to the open possibili ties offered by i nven tive metaphors . Many texts have undoubt­ edly many possible senses , but i t is still possible to decide which one has to be selected if one approaches the text i n the light of a given topic, as wel l as it is possible to tell of certai n texts how ma n y isotopies they dis­ play. (See Chapter 6, " Isotopy," where I discuss the many senses of the concept of isotopy. ) Besides , we are implementing inferences (and we are facing a certain in terpretive freedom) even when we understand an isolated word , a sentence, a visual sign.
All this amou n ts to saying that the p ri nciple of interpretation ( i n i ts Peircean sense) has not to be iden tified with the farfetched assu mption that - as Valery said -if n y' a pas de vrai sens d'un texte.
When considering contemporary theories of i n terpretation (especially i n the l i terary domai n), we can conceive of a range with two extremes x and y. ( I refuse to represen t it spatially as a l i ne going from left to right, so as not to suggest u nfair and misleading ideological connotations . ) Let us say that at the extreme x stand those who assume that every text ( be it a conversational utterance or a poem) can be in terpreted i n one, and only one, way, according to the i n tention of i ts au thor. At the extreme y stand those who assume that a text supports every interpretation - albeit I suppose that nobody would literally endorse such a claim, except perhaps a visionary devotee of the Kabalistic temura.
I do not think that the Peircea n notion of semiosis should p rivilege one of these extremes . At most, it provides a theoretical tool for identify­ ing, according to d ifferent semiosic p rocesses , a co n tinuum of i n ter­ med iate positio ns. If I ask someone what time it is a n d if he answers /6: 1 5/, my i n terpretation of this expression c a n concl ude that ( p rovided there are no other co-textual clues and provided the speaker is not a noto rious liar or a psychotic s u bj ect) the s peaker positively said that it is forty-five minutes to seven and that he intended to say so.
On the other hand, the notion of i n terpretation can explain both i n which sense a given text d i s plays two a n d no more possibilities of dis­ am biguation and why an instance of the symbolic mode requests an indefinite series of alternative or complementary i n terpretations. In a ny case, between x and y stands a recorded thesaurus of encyclopedic competence, a social s torage of world knowledge, and on these groun d s , and only on these grounds, a n y in terpretation can b e both implemented and legitimated - even in the case of the most 'open' instances of the option y.

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

O.J.
In order to d iscuss these points, all the chapters of this book, wh ile examining a series of fu ndamental concepts traditionally related to the one of sign, revisit each of them from a historical poin t of view, looking backward at the moment they were posited for the first time and were endowed with a theoretical fecundity that sometimes they have lost in the course of a millenary debate.
I t is clear from the index that most of my authors a re not linguists or full-time semioticia n s , but p h ilosophers who h ave speculated about sign s . This is not solely d ue to the fact that I started my academic career as a philosopher, particularly interested in the Middle Ages , and that since the Second Congress of the lASS (Vienna, 1 979) I h ave advocated a revisitation of the whole history of philosophy (as well as of other dis­ cipli nes) to take back the o rigins of semiotic concepts. This is not (or not only) a book in which a semiotician pays a visit, extra moenia, to the alien territory of ph ilosophy. This is a book o n p hilosophy of langu age for the very s imple reason that a general semiotics is nothing else but a ph iloso­ phy of langu age and that the 'good ' p hilosophies of language, from Cratylus to Philosophical Investigations, are concerned with all the semiotic questions.
I t is rather d ifficult to provide a 'catholic' definition of ph ilosophy of language. I n a nondogmatic overview, o ne should list u n der this heading Plato's discussions o n nomos and phusis, Aristotle' s assumption that /Be­ ing/ is used i n various senses , Russell's theory of denotation , as well as Heidegger, Cassirer, and Merleau-Pon ty. I am not s u re that a general semiotics can a nswer all the questions raised d u ring the last two thousand years by the various philosophies of language; but I am sure that all the questions a general semiotics deals with have been posited i n the framework o f some philosophy o f language.

0.4.
In order to make this poin t clear, one must distinguish between specific semiotics and general semiotics . I u nderstand that this is a very crude dis­ tinction as compared with more su btle classifications. I am thinking of Hjelmslev' s proposal according to w h ich there are a scientific semiotic and a nonscientific semiotic, both s tudied by a metasemiotic; a semiology as a metasemiotic studying a nonscientific semiotic, whose terminology is studied by a metasemiology. S ince semiotics can be either deno tative or connota­ tive, there is also a meta (connotative) semiotic. Pelc ( 1981) has outlined a far more a nalytical classification of the many levels of a semiotic s tudy. At the p resent s tate of the art, I am inclined to take these and other

I n t ro d u c t i o n

[5]

distinctions as frui tfully descriptive, while I a m not sure that they can be taken as normative. In any case, for the pu rposes of the presen t dis­ course, I think i t will be sufficien t to work upon the distinction between general and specific.
A specific semiotics is, or aims at being, the 'grammar' of a particular sign system , and p roves to be successful insofar as i t descri bes a given fiel d of com municative phenomena as ruled by a system of signification. Thus there are 'gra mmars' of the American Sign Language, of traffic signals , of a playing-card ' ma trix' for d ifferent games or of a particular game (for instance, poker) . These systems can be studied from a syntac­ tic , a seman tic , or a pragmatic point of view . Sometimes a s pecific semiotics only focuses on a particular su bsystem (or s-code, as defined i n E c o 1 976) that works within a more complex system of systems : such is the case of the theory of phonemic distinctive featu res or of the descrip­ tion of the phonemic oppositions hold ing for a given verbal language.
Every specific semiotics (as every science) is concerned with general epistemological problems . It has to posit its ow n theoretical obj ect, ac­ cord i ng to criteria of pertinence, in order to account for an otherwise d isordered field of empirical data; and the researcher must be aware of the underlying philosophical assu mptions that influence its choice and its cri teria for relevance. Like every science, even a specific semiotics ought to take i n to account a sort of 'uncertainty p rinciple' (as an­ thropologists must be aware of the fact that their presence as observers can disturb the normal course of the behavioral phenomena they ob­ serve). Notwithstanding, a s pecific semiotics can aspire to a 'scientific' statu s . S pecific semiotics s tudy phenomena that are reasonably i ndepen­ dent of their observa tion s . Thei r o bj ects are usually ' s table' - even though the d u ration of a code for traffic signals has a sho rter range than the d u ration of a phonological system, whereas lexical systems are in a continuous process of transformation . Bei ng scientific , a s pecific semio­ tics can have a predictive power: i t can tell which expressions, p roduced according to the rules of a given system of signification, are acceptable or 'gra m matical' and which ones a user of the system woul d pres umably prod uce in a given situation .
Obviously, there are differen t degrees of scien tificity, accord i ng to the rigidity or the flexibility of the sign system in q uestion. The 'grammar' of traffic lights and the structure of a phonological system seem to be more 'objective' (more 'scien tific' ) than the description of the narrative fu nctio n in Russian fairy tales; a n d the narrative function of the Russian fairy tales seems to be less questionable than, let us say, a possible sys­ tem of narrative function in the novels of French Ro manticis m. Not every s pecific semiotics can claim to be like a natural science. In fact, every ·specific semio tics i s at most a human science, and everybody

[6]

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

knows how controversial such a notion s till is . However, when cultural anthropology studies the kinship system in a certain society, it works upon a rather s table field of phenomena, can prod uce a theore tical ob­ j ect, and can make some prediction about the behavior of the members of this society. The same happens with a lexical analysis of the system of terms expressing kinship in the same society .
In this sense, a specific semiotics (as any other science) can also have effects in terms of social engi neering. When the anthropologis t increases our knowledge of a given society, his or her descriptions can be used for ' m issionary' pu rposes i n order to improve , to prese rve , or to destroy a given culture , or to exploit its members . It goes without saying that the natural sciences h ave e ngineeri n g purposes , not only in the s tric t technological sense; a good knowledge of human anatomy also can help one to im prove one' s physical fi tness. I n the same way, the description of the i n ternal logic of road signals can suggest to some public agency how to improve the practice of road signali ng. Such an engineeri n g power is t h e result of a free decisio n , n o t an a u tomatic side effect o f the scientific research.
All a round this area of more or less establis hed and rigorous 'gra mma tical' knowledge i s a hardly defi nable ' twilight zone' o f semio ti­ cally orien ted practices , s uch as the application of semiotic notions to li terary criticism, the analysis of political discourses , perhaps a great part of the so-called li nguistic philosophy when it attempts "to solve philo­ sophical problems by analyzing the meanings of word s , and by a nalyzin g logical rel ations between words in natural languages" (Searle 1 97 1 : 1 ). Freque n tly, these semiotic practices rely on the set of knowledge p ro­ vided by specific semiotics, sometimes they contribute to enriching them , and, in many other cases, they borrow their fu ndamental ideas from a general semiotics .

o.s.
The task and the nature of a general sem iotics a re different. To o u tline a proj ec t for a general sem iotics , it is not sufficient to assert, as Saussure d i d , that langu age is a system comparable to writing, symbolic rites, deaf- m u te alphabets, military signals, and so o n , and that one should conceive of a science able to study the life of s igns within the framework of social and general psychology. I n order to conceive of such a science , one must say i n which sense these different systems are mutually com­ parable: if they are all syste m s in the same sense of the word syste m ; if, by consequence , the m u tual com parison of these systems can reveal common systematic laws able to explain , from a u nified point of view , their way of fu nctioning. Saussure said that such a science did not exist as yet, even though it had a right to exist. Many semioticians assume

I n trod u c ti o n

[7]

(and I rank among the m ) that Peirce in fact outli ned such a d iscipline; but others maintain (and I still ran k among them ) that such a discipline cannot be a science in the sense of physics or electronics.
Thus the basic problem of a general semiotics splits into three differ­ ent questions: (a) Can one approach many, and apparently different, phenomena as if they were all phenomena of signification and/or of com mu n ication ? (b) Is there a u nified approach able to acco u n t for all these semiotic phenomena as if they were based on the same system of rules ( the notion of syste m not being a mere analogical one)? (c) Is this approach a 'scientific' one?
I f there is something which deserves the name of ge neral semiotics , this something is a discourse dealing with the questions a bove , and this d iscourse is a philosophical one. In any case , it e ncou n ters the problem raised by philosophy of language because, in order to answer the ques­ tions above , i t is obliged to reconsider, from a general (not merely 'lin­ guistic' ) point of view, classical issues such as meaning, reference , tru th, context, communicational acts (be they vocal or else) , as well as many logical problems as analytic vs . synthetic, necessity, i m plication , e n tail­ ment, inference , hypothesis, and so o n .
Naturally, m a n y problems t h a t originally were simply philosoph ical now belong to the province of some science. Perhaps in the future some of the problems raised today by a general semiotics will fi nd a 'scien tific' answer - for instance , the debated and still speculative problem of the u n iversals of language , tod ay tackled by the catas trophe theory. Some others will re main pure ly philosophical.
General semiotics was fi rs t of all concerned with the concept of sign. This concept is better d iscussed in Chapter 1, where I give the reasons why I think i t is s till tenable , despite the various criticisms it has under­ gon e . I t must be clear that one can decide that the theoretical object of semiotics can be a d i ffere n t and more fruitful one, let u s say, text, semiosis, significan t practice, communicatio n , d i scourse, language, ef­ fability, and so on - b u t the real problem is not so much which object has to be appoi n ted as the central one; the problem is to decide whether there is a unified object or not. Now, this obj ec t (let i t be the concept of sign) can become the central o bj ec t of a general semiotics insofar as one decides that such a category can expla i n a series of human (and maybe animal) behaviors, be they vocal, visual, termic, gestural , or other. In this sense, the first question of a general semiotics is close to the capital question of any philosophy of language: what does it mean for human beings to say, to express meanings , to convey ideas, or to mention states of the worl d ? B y which means do people perform this task? Only by words? And, i f not, what do verbal activity and other signifying or com­ municative activities have in common?
A general semiotics a t most improves some of the tradi tional ap-

proaches of philosophy of language. It assumes that it is impossible to speak abou t verbal language without comparing it to other forms of signification and/or communication . In this sense, a general semiotics is fundamentally compara tive in i ts approach. But it is enough to thin k ­ for instance - of Wittgenstein , Husser!, or Cassi rer to realize that a good philosophy of language necessarily takes u p this issue.
A general semiotics is influenced , more than any philosophy of lan­ guage , by the experi ences of specific semiotics . But the histo ry of phi­ losophy displays other examples of speculations about signification and comm u nication that have attempted to elaborate a systematic approach to every sort of 'language' - s ta rti n g fro m the res u l ts and from the technicalities of some specific semiotics. Thus a general semiotics is simply a philosophy of language which s tresses the comparative and sys­ tematic approach to languages (and not only to verbal l a nguage) by exploiting the result of d ifferent, more local inquiries.

0.6.
Not all philosophers of language would agree with such a project. Many of them assume that the categories p rovided in order to explain verbal l anguage - incl u d i ng 'signification' , 'meaning' , and 'code' - cannot hold when applied to other systems of significatio n . In Chapter I of this book, I discuss a s trong obj ection formulated in this line of though t, accord i ng to which semiotics u n duly fuses three differen t problems con­ cerning three differen t and mutu ally irred ucible phenomena, studied by three differe n t theoretical approaches - namely, intended meaning, infer­ ence from evidences, and pictorial representation. It goes without saying that, o n the contrary, I assume that these three p roblems concern a unique theore tical obj ect. Elsewhere ( Eco 1 976) I discussed i n which sense ver­ bal s i g n i fic a t i o n a n d picto r i a l re p re se n ta t i o n ( a s w e l l a s o t h e r phenomena) can b e subsumed under the general model o f the sign­ fu nction . Here I shall maintain that inferential processes (mainly under the form of Peircean abduction) s tand a t the basis of eve ry semiotic phenomen'o n .
I t h a s been suggested (see, for i nstance, Scruton 1 980) t h a t t h e word sign means too many things and points to many functions ; thus semiotics would play o n mere - and weak - analogies when it asserts that a cloud means rain i n the same sense i n which the F rench sentence 'je m'ennuie' means that I a m bore d . What these two phenomena have i n common is "only a small featu re on the s u rface of each" and "if there is a common essence of 'signs' i t is s u re to be very shallow; semiology preten d s that it is deep" (Scruton 1 980). I suspect that no semiotician would say that on the surface a cloud and a sentence have something in common. As I recall in Chapter I of this book, G reek philosophers took a long time to rec-

Introduction

ognize that there was some relation between 'natural signs' and word s ,

a n d even t h e S toics , w h o decidedly approached t h e proble m , fo und

some d ifficulty in settling it definitively. This means that, if a cloud and

a sentence have something in common, this something is not shallow but

deep.

O n the other hand , there is something 'intuitively' common to the red

light of a traffic signal and the verbal order /s top/. One does not need to

have a semiotic mind to unders tand this. The semiotic p roblem is not so

much to recognize that both physical vehicles convey more or less the

same command; it begins when one wonders about the cultural or cog­

nitive mechanis m s that allow any trained add ressee to react to both

sign-vehicles in the same way. To realize that /stop/ and the red ligh t

convey the same order is as intuitive as to decide that, to convince

people to refrain from d rinking a certain liquid, one can either write

/poison/ or d raw a skull on the bottle . Now, the basic problem of a

semiotic inquiry on different kinds of signs is exactly this one: why does

one understand something intuitively?

As posited this way, the question is more than semiotic. I t s tarts as a

p h ilosophical question (even though i t can have a scientific answer, too) .

Frequently, o n e u s e s t h e adjective 'intuitive' as an empiricist shibboleth

and gets rid of a lot of interesting questions by recu rring to 'intuitive

truths' . To say that some truth is intuitive usually means that one does

not want to challenge it for the sake of economy - that is, because i ts

explanation belongs to some other science. However, one (if not the

most important) of the semiotic endeavors is to explain why something

looks intuitive, in order to discover under the felicity of the so-called

i n tuition a com plex cognitive p rocess .

I t is intuitive that I can seduce a lady, a potential partner in an impor­

tant business, or a corru p t politician , either by saying that I am rich and

generous or by offering her or him a titillating d inner in the most l uxuri­

prod uce ideas and emotions in the mind of the potential victi m . B ut, in

order to explain how both behaviors p roduce the same effect, one should

look for somethi ng 'deeper' . To look for such a deeper common s truc­

ture, for the cognitive and cultural laws that ru le both phenomena ­

such is the endeavor of a general semio tics . Once having addressed this

p roblem, one probably woul d be in the position of deciding whether the

same cultu ral or cognitive mechanisms also hold in the case of the cloud

and the sentence .

the questions raised above ; it can also decide, for instance (as many semioticians did ) , that the way in which a cloud s ignifies rai n is diffe rent from the way i n which a French sentence signifies - or is equivalent to - a n alleged ly correspond ing E ngl i s h sentence . Semiotics is char­ acterized by its interest in these problems, not by a prerecorded set of answers .
To b e interested in these problems requires a philosophical curiosi ty ; according t o Aristotle, it is by a n a c t of wonder t h a t men bega n , and begin, to philosophize; and, according to Peirce, all new discoveries start when "we find some very cu rious circumstances which will be explained by the supposition that it was the case of a general rule and thereupon adopt that s u pposi tion" (C. P. 2 . 624) . The concept of sign - or every other concept a general semiotics decides to posit as its own theoretical obj ect - is nothing but the result of a supposition of this sort. Signs are not e m pirical o bj e c ts . E mp i rical o bj ec ts become signs (or they are looked at as signs) only from the poi n t of view of a p h ilosophical decision.

o.,.
When semiotics posits such concepts as 'sign ' , it does not act like a science; i t acts like philosophy when it posits such abstractions as sub­ ject, good and evil, truth or revolution. Now, a p hilosophy is not a sci­ ence, because its assertions cannot be empirically tested, and this im­ possibility is due to the fact that philosophical concepts are not 'ernie' definitions of previously recognizable 'etic' data that d isplay even mini­ mal resemblance i n shape or functio n . Philosophical enti ties exist only insofar as they have been philosoph ically posited. Outside their philo­ sophical framework, the empirical data that a philosophy organ izes lose every possible unity and cohesion.
To walk, to make love , to sleep , to refrai n from doing someth i ng, to give food to someone else, to eat roast beef on Friday - each is either a physical eve n t or the absence of a p hysical event, or a relation between two or more physical events. H owever, each becomes a n instance of good , bad , or neutral behavior within a given philosophical framework. Outside such a framework, to eat roast beef is radically d i fferent from making love , and maki n g love is always the same sort of activity inde­ pendent of the legal status of the partners . From a given philosophical point of view, both to eat roast beef on Friday and to make love to x can become instances of 'sin' , whereas both to give food to someone and to make love to y can become instances of virtuous action.
Good or bad are theoretical stipulations according to which, by a philosophical decision, many scattered instances of the most different

facts or acts become the some thing. It is interesting to remark that also the notions of 'obj ect', 'phenomenon' , or 'natural kind ' , as used by the natu­ ral sciences , s hare the same p hilosophical nature. This is certainly not the case of specific semiotics or of a human science such as cultural an thropology. Anthropologists elaborate the notion of brother-in-law to define e mically a series of etic occu rre nces , where differe n t persons play the same social function - and they would play this function etically even tho ugh no science had p revio usly d e fined their ernie rol e . A b rother-in-law exists independently as a male human being who, like other male h uman beings , has a sister who has married another male human being; like other male human beings in the same position, a b rother-in-law performs (during certain ceremonies) certain ri tual acts , allegedly because of his relationship with a given woman and a given man . Anthropologists can fail in detecting the true reason he performs these ritual acts or i n selecting certain features of his behavior as rele­ vant, disregarding other phenomena (or can overdo in asserting that the opposition brother-in-law/sister-in-law is analogous to the phonetic op­ position voiced/unvoiced . . . ) . But the anth ropologists start from the u nquestionable fact that there are n uclei of three persons eac h , forming both a cou ple of sibli ngs of the same parents and a couple of persons of differe n t sex living and having sex together.
In philosophy things go differen tly. What is ' true' for Hegel is rad i­ cally differe n t from what is ' true' for Tarski , and, when the School men said that tru th is the odoequotio rei et intellectus, they did not describe e ntities that were recognizable as such before that definition. The defi­ n i tion decides what a thing i s , w h a t u n d e rs tanding i s , and what odoequotio is.
This does not mean that a philosophy cannot explain phenomena. It h as a great explanatory power, s ince i t p rovides a way t o consider as a whole many otherwise disconnec ted data - so that, when a scientific approach starts with defining an observable datum and a correct (or true) observation , i t starts by positing ph ilosophical categories. A p hilosophy cannot, however, be true i n the sense in which a scientific description (even though depending on p revious p hilosophical assumptions) is said to be true. A p hilosophy is true insofar as i t satisfies a need to provide a coherent form to the worl d , so as to allow its followers to deal coherently with it.
I n this sense, a philosophy has a practical power: it con tri b u tes to the changing of the world . This practical power has noth ing to do with the engineering power that i n the discussion above I attributed to sciences, including specific semiotics . A science can study either an animal species or the logic of road signals, without necessarily determining their trans­ formatio n . There is a certain 'distance' between the descriptive stage

[1 2]

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

and the decisio n , let us say, to improve a species thro ugh gen etic engineering or to improve a signaling system by reducing or i ncreasing the number of its pertinent elements.
On the contrary, i t was the philosophical position of the modern no­ tion of thinking subj ect that led Wes tern culture to think and to behave in terms of s u bj ectivity. It was the position of notions such as class struggle and revolution that led people to behave in terms of class, and not only to m ake revolutions b u t also to decide, o n the grounds of this philosophical concept, which social tu rmoils or riots of the past were or were not a revolution. Since a philosophy has this practical power, it cannot have a predictive power. It cannot predict what would happen if the world were as it described it. I ts power is not the direct result of an act of engineering performed on the basis of a more or less neutral descrip­ tion of independent d ata. A philosophy can know what i t has p rod uced only apres coup. Marxism as a philosophy displays a reasonable explana­ tory power and has had , i ndeed , a consistent pra'Ctical power: i t contrib­ uted to the transformation , i n the long run , of m a ny ideas and some states of the world . It failed when , assuming to be a science, it clai med to have a predictive power: it transformed ideas and sta tes of the world in a direction it coul d not exactly foresee. Applying to globality, a phi­ losophy does not play its role as an actor d urin g a reci tal; it i nteracts with other p hilosophies and with other facts , and it cannot know the results of the i nteraction between itself and other world visions. World visions can conceive of everything, except alternative world visions , if not in order to criticize them and to show their inconsistency. Affected as they are by a constitutive solipsism , philosophies can say everyth ing about the world they design and very little about the world they help to construct.

o.S.
A general semiotics is philosophical in this very sense. I t cannot work o n concre te evidence, if n o t as already fil tered b y other s pecific semiotics (which depends on a general semiotics to be j u s tified in their proce d u r­ es). A ge nera l semiotics s tudies the whole of the h u m a n sign ifying activity - languages - and languages are what constitutes human beings as such, that is, as semiotic animals. It studies and describes languages through languages. By s tudying the human s ignifying activity i t i nflu­ e nces its course. A general semiotics transforms, for the very fact of its theore tical claim, i ts own obj ect.
I do not know, as yet, whether a pragmatic theory of s peech acts is a chapter of general semiotics or a chapter of a philosophy of language. It should be clear, from the whole of this i ntroduction, that such a question is, to me , devoid of a ny interest. Undoubtedly, a theory of s peech acts

Introd uction

[13 ]

starts from the observation (although never innocen t) of certain empirical behaviors . I n this sense, many of its d iscoveries could be ranked as items of a specific semiotics. However, I doubt whether a notion such as the one of performative sentence is a neutral one. One says /1 pro m ise you/ and be ts one's shirt on this promise; in other cases, one u tters the same expression without being aware of the fact that one is 'doing things with words' . B u t a theory of speech acts provides us with such a n organized knowledge of our linguistic interaction that the future of our linguistic behavior cannot but be profoundly influenced by the sort of awareness it provides . So a theory of s peech acts is explanatory, practically powerfu l , and n o t fully predictive . I t is an instance of philosophy of language, perhaps a chapter of a general semiotics , not a case of specific semiotics.
I am not saying that philosophies, since they are speculative, speak of the nonexistent. When they say 'subj ect' or 'class s truggle' or 'dialec­ tics' , they always point to something that should have been defined and posited in some way. Philosophies can be j udged, at most, on the grounds of the perspicacity with which they decide that something is worthy of beco m i ng the starting point for a global explanato ry hypothe­ sis. Thus I do not thi n k that the sign (or any other suitable object for a general semiotics) is a mere figme nt. Notwithstanding, signs exist only for a philosophical glance which decides to see the m where other minds see only the fic tive result of a n analogical 'muse ment' .
Certainly, the categories posited by a genera l semiotics can prove their power insofar as they p rovide a satisfactory working hypothesis to spe­ cific semiotics . However, they can also allow one to look at the whole of human activity from a cohere n t point of view. To see human beings as signifying animals - even outside the practice of verbal language - and to see that their ability to produce and to i n terpret signs, as well as their ability to d raw inferences , is rooted in the same cognitive s tructu res , represent a way to give form to our experience. There are obviously other philosophical approaches, but I think that this one deserves some effort.

S I GNS
1.1. Crisis of a concept
Curre n t hand books of semiotics provide us with differe n t d efinitions of the concept of sign which are often complementary rather than con­ tradictory. According to Peirce , a sign is "something which stands to somebody for something i n some respect or capac i ty" (C. P. 2 . 228). This defi nition is a more articulate version of the classical defi n i tion aliquid stat pro aliquo. When dealing with the inner structure of the sign , Saus­ sure speaks of a twofold entity (signifier and signified ) . Hj el mslev' s d ef­ initio n , which assumes the sign-fu nction as a m u tual correlation between two functives (expression-plane and conte n t-plane), can be taken as a more rigorous development of the Saussurean concept.
H owever, i n the same period at the turn of the cen t u ry i n which semiotics asserted itself as a discipline, a series of theore tical proposi­ tions concerning the death, or at least the crisis of the concept, of sign was d eveloped . Throughou t the histo ry of Western thought, the idea of a semiotic theory - however differently defined - was always labeled as a doctrine of signs (see Jakobson 1 974; Rey 1 973 ; Sebeok 1 976; Todorov 1 977). The disparity of meanings attributed each time to the notion of sign calls for a rigorous critique (at least in the Kantian sense of the word 'critique' ) . We shall see, however, that the notion of sign had been seri­ ously questio ned in this sense since the very beginning.
I n '"the last few years , this reasonable critical attitude seems to have generated its own mannerism . Since it is rhetorically effective to begin a cou rse in p hilosophy by annou ncing the death of philosophy, as F reud is pronounced dead a t the opening of debates on psychoanalysis, m a ny people have deemed useful to start out in semiotics by announcing the
[14]

Signs

[15]

death of the sign. This a n nouncement is rarely prefaced by a philosoph­ ical analysis of the concept of sign or by its reexamination in terms of historical sema ntics . The death sentence is therefore pronounced upon a n entity whic h , being without i ts identity papers , is likely to be resusci­ tated under a different name .

1.2. The signs of an obstinacy
Everyday language and the dictionaries which record i ts usages disregard theore tical d iscussions and i nsist on using the notion of sign in the most varied ways . E ven too varied . A phenomenon of this kind deserves at­ te n tio n .
I.:Z.I. First of all, we fi nd a cluster of linguistic usages according to which the sign is a manifest indication from which inferences can be made about something latent. This includes the usage of sign for medical symptoms , c rimi nal evidence , weather forecast, premonitory signs, presages, the signs of the coming of the An tichrist. . . . A sample of urine for a nalysis was called signum by the ancients , which leads us to think in terms of a synecdochic relationship, as if the sign were a part, an aspect, a periph­ eral manifestation of something which does not appear in its e ntirety. B u t the relationship appears to be a meto nymic one as wel l , since the d ictionaries speak of sign also for any trace or visible imprint left by an imprin ter on a s u rface. Therefore , the sign is also revelatory of a contact, in a way which tells us something about the shape of the imprinter. These signs, besides revealing the nature of the impri n ter, may become marks of the imprinted obj ects - for instance, bruises, scratches, scars (identifying marks). Ruins belong to the same category : they are the signs of ancie n t gra ndeur, of human settlement, or of the flourishing trades of the past.
In all these cases , the fact that the sign is produced i n tentionally or by a h uman sender is not relevant. Any natural eve n t can be a sign . Morris asserted that "something is a sign only because it is interpre ted as a sign of some thii?-g by some interp reter. Semiotics , then , is not concerned with the study of a particular kind of obj ect, but with ord i nary obj ects insofar (and only insofar) as they participate in semiosis" ( 1 938: 20). However, this fi rst ca tegory of signs seems to be characterized by the fact that the 'standing for' relationship is based on an i nfere n tial mecha­ nism: if red sky at night, then sailor' s delight. I t is the Philonian mecha­ nism of implicatio n : p ::J q. The S toics were thinking about this sign category when they asserted that a sign is "a proposition constituted by a valid and revealing connection to its consequent" (Sextus E mpiricus,

[ 1 6]

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

Adv. Math . 7 . 245 ) . The same sign category was the obj ec t of Hobbes' and Wolff ' s .defi nitions. Accord i ng to Hobbes, a sign is the evident antecedent of .a consequen t or the consequent of an antecedent when similar consequences have previously been observed (Leviathan 1 . 3) . For Wolff, a sign is "an entity from which the present or future or past exist­ ence of another being is inferred" (Ontology, p . 95 2 ) .

1.2.2. Common language , though , points to a seco nd category of signs. The sign is a gesture prod uced with the intention of communicating, that is, i n order t o transmit one's representation or i n n e r state t o another being. The existence of a certain rule (a code) enabling both the sender and the addressee to understand the manifestation in the same way must, of cou rse , be presupposed if the transmission is to be successfu l ; i n this sense, n avy flags , s treet signs, signboard s , trademarks , labels, emblems, coats of arms, and letters a re taken to be signs. Dictionaries and culti­ vated language must a t this point agree and take as signs also word s , that is, the elements of verbal language . I n all the cases examined here , the relationship between the aliquid and that for which it stands seems to be less adventu rous than for the first category. These signs appear to be expressed by a relation of equivalence rather than by one of i nfere nce : p = q. /Woman/ = •ifemme or donna»; or /woman/ = « a n imal, h u m a n , fem i n i n e , adult» . Fu rthermore , these s i g n s s e e m t o d e p e n d on arbi trary decisions.

I.:Z.J. The clear opposition between the two categories mentioned above is upset by the use of the word sign in relation to those so-called symbols which represent abstract o bj ects and relationships , such as logical , chem­ ical , alge b raic formulas, and diagrams. They appear as arbi trary as the signs of the second category; yet, through a s tructu ral formula or a d ia­ gram, the operations which I perform on the expression modify the con­ ten t . If these o perations are performed following certain rules, the result provides m e with new information about the content. By alteri ng the lines of a topographical chart, I can p redict the possible order of the corresponding terri tory ; by i nscri b i ng triangles w i thin a circle, I d iscover new properties of the circle. This happens because i n these sign there a re one-to-one correspond e nces between expression and content. There­ fore , they are usually arbitrary and yet contain eleme n ts of motivation. As a consequence , the signs of the third category, even though emitted by human beings with the i n te ntion of communicating, seem to follow the same model as the signs of the first category: p ::J q, even though they are not natural . They are called iconic or analogica l .

Signs

[17]

1.2-4I n a similar way, any visual p rocedure reproducing concrete o bj ects, such as the d rawing of an animal i n order to com m unicate the corresponding object and concept, is considered to be an iconic sigh. What do d rawings and diagrams have i n com m o n ? The fact that I can perform on them certain operations: if I d raw a moustache on my portrait, I know what I will look like if I wear a moustach e . What makes them different? The (appare n t) fac t that the diagram responds to highly codified and precise rules of productio n , whereas the drawing appears more spon­ taneous. Also , the diagram reproduces a n abstract o bj ect, whereas the d rawing reprod uces a concre te obj ect. B u t this is not always true : the unicorns of the B ritish royal coat of arms stand for an abstraction , a fic­ titious obj ect; they stand at most for a ( a n i m aginary) class of animals. O n the other hand , Good man ( 1968) discusses at length the problematic difference between a pe rson's i mage and the image of a person . What makes the difference between the two? Is it related to the inte nsional properties of the content reprod uced by the d rawing or to the exten­ sional use that we decide to make of the d rawing? The proble m was prese nt already (and not e ntirely resolved) in Plato's Cratylus.

1.2.5. However, com mon usage also considers as signs those d rawings which rep rod uce som e thing, but in a stylized form , so that recognizing the ob­ j ec t represented is less i m portant that recognizing a con te n t 'other' for which the rep rese n ted o bj ec t stands. The C ross, the Cresce n t , the H a m mer and Sickle s tand for Christianity , Isla m , and Com m unis m , re­ spectively. These signs are iconic because - like diagrams and d rawings - they can b e subj ected t o manipulations o f the expressions which affect the con tent. They a re also arbi trary because by now they are in a state of catachresis. They are com mo nly called symbols , but in a sense opposite to that adopted for formulas and diagra m s . Whereas the latter are quite em pty, open to any meaning, the former are quite ful l , filled with multiple but definite meanings.

1.2.6.
Finally, certa i n l anguages - for i n s tance, Italian - adopt expressions such as colpire nel segno (to hit the target, to touch the sme s pot) , mettere a segno ( to score , as in to score an u p percut) , fare un segno dove si deve tag/iare ( to draw a dressmaker' s pattern for where the cloth is to be cut), passare il segno ( to overstep the mark) : signs as targe ts, termina ad quae, to be used as markings in order to proceed in a thorough way (perfila e per segno ) . The aliquid in this case, rather than standing for, s tands where a certain operation is to be addresse d . It is an instruction rather than a

substi tu tio n . In this sense , the North Star is a s ign for the sailor. The structure of the link is inferential , b u t with some complications: if p now, and if therefore you will do z, then you will obtain q.

I .J. Intension and extension
Too many things are signs, and too differe nt from each other. This tur­ moil of homonymies is compl icated by a further equ ivocation . Is the sign "res, praeter speciem quam ingerit sensibus, aliud aliquid ex se faciens in cog­ nitationem venire" (Augustine, De Doctrina Christiana 2 . I . 1 ) , or, as i n elsewhere sugges ted by the same Augustine, is the s ign something by which we ind icate obj ects or states of the worl d ? Is the sign an i n ten­ sional or an extensional device? Let us attempt an analysis of a typical semiotic m aze . A red flag with a H a m mer and Sickle is equivalent to Com m unism (p = q ) . B u t if someone carries a red flag with a H a m mer and Sickle, then that person is p robably a Com munist (p ::J q). If we take a statement such as at home I have ten cats, what is the sign? Is i t the word cats (domestic felines), the global content of the sentence (in my house I keep ten domes tic felines) , the reference to the fact that it j ust so hap­ pens that within the world of our actual experience there is a specific house where there are ten specific cats? Or is it the fact that, if I have ten cats at home , then I must have enough space for them, then I prob­ ably cannot keep a dog, and then I am an animal love r? Fu rthermore , in all these cases, what constitutes the sign? Is i t the concre te occu rre nce or the abstract type? Is is the phonetic u tte rance [kat] , or the phonological and lexical model /cat!? Is i t the fact that hie et nunc I have ten cats at home (with all the possible inferences ) , or the class of all the facts of this nature , so that anyone who so mehow happens to have ten cats at home will show himself or herself to be an animal lover who cannot possibly keep a dog?

1-4- Elusive solutions
Some people claim that the word sign can be applied only to linguistic entities. Malmberg, for i nstance , d ecides to call a sym bol any element rep resenting something else, and to keep the term 'sign' to indicate " those units which, like the signs of language , have a double articulation and owe their exis tence to an act of significatio n" (where signification means intentional communication) ( 1 977: 2 1 ) . Every s ign is a symbol, but not every symbol is a sign. This decision , i n itself moderate , does not determine, however, (a) to what extent signs are relatable to symbols and (b) which science should study symbols and which categories should be e mployed . Furthermore , the d ifference between extension and in-

te nsion is not clarified, even though the study of signs is presu med to be intensionally oriented.
This distinction between areas is suggested at t i m e s on t h e basis of more radical epistemological inte ntions . Harman, for instance , argues as follows :

Smoke means fire and the word combustion means fi re , b u r nor in the same sense of means. The word means is a mbiguous . To say that s moke means fire is to say that smoke is a sym p to m , sign, ind ication, or evidence for fire . To say that the word combustion means fire is to say that people use the word to mean fi re . F u rthermore, there is no ordinary sense of the word mean in which a pictu re of a man means a man or means that man. This suggests that Peirce' s theory of signs would com p rise at least three rather differe n t subj ects: a theo ry of t h e i n tended meaning, a theory of evidence, and a theory of pictorial depiction. The re is no reason to think that these theories m ust contai n common principles. ( 1 977: 23)

Harman's argument clashes, first of all , with the linguistic usage . Why have people used the word sign for more than two thousand years to d efi ne p h e n o m e n a which s h o u l d be d i v i d e d i n to three d i ffe re n t categories? Second , Harman's obj ection goes against the consensus gentium of the philosophical trad ition. Fro m the Stoics to the Middle Ages, from Locke to Peirce , from Husser! to Wittgenste i n , there has been a con­ stant atte m pt to fi nd a common basis for the theory of l inguistic meaning and for the theory of pictorial representation , and also for the theory of meaning and the theory of inference.
F i n a l l y , the o bj ec tion goes aga i n s t a p h i losophical i n s tinct, very adequately s u m m arized by Aristotle in terms of the 'wonder' which in­ duces persons to philosophize . What is the ' meaning' of the expression at home I have ten cats? Is it its propositional content or what can be inferred from the fact that I have ten cats? One could answer that the second phenomenon has nothing to do with linguistic meaning, si nce it belongs t o t h e universe of proofs which can b e articulated b y using the facts represe n ted by the proposi tions. Yet, is the antecedent evoked by language so easily separable from the language which rep resented it? When we examine the problem of the Stoic semeion (UTJJ-tELOV), we shall see how a mbiguous and inextricable is the re lationship among a fact, the proposition which represents it, and the sente nce which expresses that propositio n . In any event, what makes the two problems difficult to separate is precisely the fact that in both cases aliquid statpro aliquo. The manner of standing for may vary, yet we still face a peculiar d i alectic of presence and absence i n both cases. Is this not a good e nough reason to ask whether a common mechanism, however deep, might govern both phenomena?

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

A man wears a badge with a Hammer and Sickle at h is buttonhole. Are we facing a case of 'intended meani ng' ( the man wants to say that he is a Com munist), of pictorial represe ntation ( the badge represents 'sym­ bolically' the u nion of workers and peasants), or of inferential p roof (if he wears the badge , then he must be a Com munist)? The same eve nt fal ls within the scope of what Harman sees as three differe n t categories . I t is true that the same phenomenon can be the o bjet:t of quite different theories: the badge can be studied by i norganic chemistry in terms of the material of which it is made, by physics in terms of its being subjected to gravitational laws, by economics in terms of i ts being an industrial p rod­ uct which is bought and sol d . But, in our case , the badge is the o bject of the three (presumed) theories of meaning, of representation and of evi­ dence only inas m uch as it does not standfor itself. It does not stand for its molecular composition , its tendency to fall down, i ts capability of being packaged and transported. I t stands for something which is outside it­ self. I n this sense i t gives rise to wonder, and it becomes the same abstract obj ect of the same theoretical question .

1.5. The deconstruction o f the linguistic sign
The following critiques have characteristics in common: first, when they speak of sign in general and consider other kinds of signs , they point to the structu re of the linguistic sign . Second , they ten d to dissolve the sign into entities of greater or lesser purport.
1.5.1. Sign vs. figura
As an e ntity, the s ign is too l a rge . Phonology' s wo rk on li nguistic signifiers , seen as the result of the articulation of lesser phonological u nits, s tarts o u t with the S toic's discovery of the stoicheia (urotxeia) , it reaches maturity with Hj elmslev' s postulating the existe nce of figurae, a n d is c rown e d by Jakobso n ' s theory o f d i s tinc tive fe a t u re s . This theore tical achievement does not in itself question the notion of linguis­ tic sign , but with Hjelmslev there arises the possibility of identifying figurae a t the content level as well :
If, for example, a mech anical inventory at a given stage o f t h e proced u re leads to a registration of the entities of content ' ram' , 'ewe ' , 'man ' , 'wo­ man' , ' boy' , 'girl' , 'stallion' , ' mare' , 'sheep' , 'hu man bei ng' , 'child' , 'horse' , 'he' , and 'she' - then ' ram ' , 'ewe' , ' man' , 'woman' , ' boy' , 'girl' , 'stallion' , and 'mare' m u s t be eliminated from the i nvento ry of elements if they can be explained u n ivocally as relational u n i ts that include only 'he' or 'she' on the one hand, and 'sheep' , 'human being' , 'child', 'horse' , on the other. ( 1 943 : 70)

Signs

[21 ]

The discove ry o f a content articul ation leads Hj elmslev to argue that languages cannot be d escribed as p u re sign syste m s :

By t h e aims usually attribu ted t o them t h e y are fi rst a n d foremost sign sys­ tems; but by their in ternal s tructu re they are first and foremost something different, namely, systems of figuroe that can be used to construct s igns. The definition of a language as a sign system has thus s hown i tself, on closer analysis, to be unsatisfactory. I t concerns only the external functions of a l anguage , its relation to the nonlinguistic factors that su rround it, but not its proper, internal functions. (Ibid . , p . 47)
The sign (or the sign-function) appears, therefore , as the manifest and recognizable end of a net of aggregations and disintegrations constantly open to further combinations. The linguistic sign is not a unit of the syste m of signification; it is, rather, a detectable unit in the process of com m unication.
Despite being invaluable for the whole develop ment of structu ral semantics, Hj elmslev's proposal does not account for o ther kinds of signs in which it appears that the two functives are not analyzable fu rther into figuroe. If the cloud which annou nces the s torm and the portrait of the Mona Lisa are to be taken as signs, there must be signs withou t expres­ sion figuroe, and perhaps wi thou t content figuroe as well. Prieto ( 1 966) has decidely widened the field of sign analysis by showing the existence of systems without a rticulation, and systems which have only a first ar­ ticu latio n . The white stick of the blind - a posi tive p resence which constitutes itself as pertinent against the absence of the stick, as a signifier withou t articulations - represents blind ness in general , request­ ing the right of way, postulating understanding on the part of bystanders . I n short, it conveys a content nebula. A s a syste m the s tick is quite s i m ple ( p resence vs. absence), but its com municational use is very com plex. If the s tick is not a sign , what is it, and what should it be called?

1 .5.2. Signs vs. sentences In the same years which saw Hj el mslev' s critique of the sign format as too b road , B uyssens maintained that the format of the sign was too minute. The semantic unit is not the sign , but something corresponding to the sentence, which Buyssens calls seme. The example given by B uys­ sens concerns s treet signs as well as linguistic signs . He maintains that an arrow, isolated from the context of the stree t sign, does not a llow for the concre tization of a "state of consciousness ." In order to perform this function it will have to have a certain color, a certain orientation, and it will have to appear on a specific street sign , placed in a specific location. "The same thing happens with the isolated word , for instance, the word

[22]

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

table. This word appeared as the potential me m ber of d i fferent sente nces in which different things are talked about" ( B uyssens 1 943 : 38).
Stiange opposition : Hje lmslev is u n i n terested in the sign because he is interested i n language as an abstract syste m ; Buyssens is u n i n terested i n the sign because he is i n terested in com m u n ication as a concrete act. O bviously, the opposi tion extension vs . intension i s in the background of this debate . Unpleasant homonymy: componential semantics will call Hj el mslev' s content figurae (smaller than the sign) 'semes ' , while the tradition which developed from B uyssens (Prieto , De Mauro) will use the term 'seme' for uttera nces larger than the sign.
I n any case, B uysse ns' seme is what others will call sente nce or a performed speech act. What is s u rprising is the i n i tial s tatement by B uyssens, according to which a sign does not have meaning. If it is true that nominantur singularia sed universalia significantur, one should rather say that the word table by itself does not name (it does not refer to) anything, but has a meaning, which Hjelmslev could have subdivided into figurae. Buyssens ad m i ts that this word (like the arrow) can be a potential m e m be r of different phrases . What is there , then, in the con­ tent of table which allows i t to enter expressions such as dinner is on the table or the table is made of wood, and not in expressions such as the table eats the fish or he washed his face with the dinner table? I t must be agreed , then, that precisely because o f its susceptibility t o analysis b y content figurae, the word table must include both atomic u n i ts of content and contextual instructions rul i ng over the word ' s capacity to e n te r li nguistic segments larger than the sign .
P ri e to ( 1 975 : 27) c l a rified t h i s a p p a re n t d i s a gree m e n t b e tw e e n Hj elmslev a n d B uyssens b y stating that t h e seme ( for B uyssens) is a functional unit, whereas the figura is an economic unit. Hj elmslev postu­ lated the sign as a functional u n i t and the figura as an economic unit. The problem is to identify , not two , but three or more levels, where the lower level is always constituted as the economic unit of the upper level's functional unit.
B uyssens' d i s tinction certainly anticipates , with its concreteness and complexity, all the theories opposing to the s ign the speech act. How­ ever, Plato and Aristotle, the Stoics and the Soph ists had already talked about the differences exis ting between the meaning of words and the p ragmatic nature of the question, the prayer, and the order. Those who oppose a pragmatics of discourse to a semantics of sign units shift the atten­ tion from the syste m s of sign ification to the process of com m u n ication ( Eco 1 976) ; but the two perspectives are actually complementary. One cannot think of the sign without seeing i t in some way characterized by its contextual destiny, but at the same time it is difficul t to explain why a certain speech act is understood u nless the n a ture of the signs which it contextualizes is explained.

1.5 .3· The sign as difference The elements of the signifier a re set i n to a system of oppositions in whic h , as Saussure explained , there are o n ly d i ffe re nces . The s a me thing happens with the signified . In the famous example given by Hj elmslev ( 1 943 : 39), the difference in the content of two apparently
synonymous te rms, /Holz/ and /bois/, is given by the differen t segmen­ tation of the conti n u u m . The German /Holz/ encompasses everything which is n o t /Baum / a n d is not / Wald/ . The corre l a tion b e tween expression-plane and content-plane is also given by a difference : the sign-function exists by a dialectic of presence and absence, as a mutual exchange between two hete rogeneities . S tarting from this s truc tu ral premise, one can dissolve the entire sign syste m i n to a net of fractures. The nature of the sign is to be found i n the 'wound' or 'opening' or 'divarication' which constitu tes it and annuls it at the same ti me.
This idea, although vigorously developed by poststructuralist thought, that of Derrida in particular, was actually developed much earlier. In the s hort text De organo sive arte cogitandi, Leibniz, searching for a restricted nu mber of thoughts from whose combination all the others could be de­ rived (as is the case with numbers ) , locates the essential combinational matrix in the opposition between God and nothing, presence and ab­ sence. The binary system of calcul a tion is the wondrous likeness of this d i a l ec tics .
F ro m a metaphysical perspective , i t m ay be fascinating to see every oppositional structure as based on a consti tu tive diffe rence which dis­ solves the differe n t te rm s . Still, i n order to conceptualize an oppositional system where something is perceived as absent, something else must be postulated as present, at least pote n tially. The presence of one element is necessary for the absence of the other. All observations concerning the im por­ tance of the absent element hold symmetrically for the present element as wel l . All observations concerning the constitu tive fu nction of differ­ e nce hold for the poles from whose opposition the difference is gener­ a ted . The argu ment is, therefore , an a u tophagous one. A phoneme is no doubt an abstract position within a syste m , and i t acq u i res its value only because of the other phonemes to which i t is opposed . Yet, for an 'ernie' unit to be recognized, it must be formulated somehow as 'etic' . In other word s , phonology builds u p a system of oppositions i n order to explain the fu nctioning of a nu mber of phonetic presences which, if they do not exist prior to the syste m , nonetheless are associated with i ts ghost. Without people uttering sounds, phonology could not exist, but without the sys te m postulated by phonology, people could not disti nguish be­ tween sound s . Types are recognized through, thei r realizations into con­ c re te tokens. One cannot speak of a form (of the expression or of the content) with o u t presu pposing a m a t te r and li nking it i m m e d i a tely (neither before nor after) to a s ubstance.

[24]

S EMIOTICS AND TH E PHI LO!iOPHY OF LANGUAGE

1.5 -4- The predominance of the signifier The answer give n to the preced i ng question could confirm a further cri tique of the notion of sign. If the sign can be known only through the signifier and if the signified emerges only through an act of perpetual su bstitu tion of the signifer, the sem iotic chain appears to be just a 'chain of s ignifiers' . As such, it could be manipulated even by the unconscious (if we take the unconscious as being li nguistically constituted). By the 'd rift' of signifiers , other signifiers are produced . As a more or less direct consequence of these conclusions, the universe of signs and even of sentences would d issolve into d iscou rse as an activi ty . This line of thought, derived from Lacan, has generated a number of varied, but essentially related, positions.
The basis for this critique is actually a misunderstanding, a word play. Only by substitu ting 'signified' every time 'signifier' appears , d oes the d iscourse of these theoreticians become com p rehensible . The misun­ derstanding deri ves from the fact that every signifier can only be trans­ lated into another s ignifier and that only by this process of interpretation can one grasp the 'corresponding signified' . I t must be clear, though , that in none of various displacement and condensation processes de­ scribed by F reu d - however m ultiplied and al most automatic the ge nerative and d rifting mechanisms might appea r - does the interplay (even if based on assonances , alliterations, likeness of expression) fail to reverberate i m mediately on the aggregation of the conte n t units, actually determ i ning the content. In the Freudian passage fro m /Herr-signore/ to /Signorelli/, a series of expression diffe rences is at work, based on iden­ tities and progressive slidi ngs of the content. The F reudian exam p le can, in fact, be understood only by someone who knows both German and I talian, seeing words as complete s ign-functions (expression + con­ tent). A person who does not know Chinese cannot prod uce F reudian slips interpretable in Chinese, unless a psychoanalyst who knows Chinese demonstrates that his or her patient had displaced linguistic re­ membrances and that he or she unconsciously played with Chinese ex­ p ressio ns. A F reudian slip, in order to make sense, plays on content figurae; if i t plays only with expression figurae it amounts to a mechanical error ( typographical or phonetic). This kind of mechanical error is likely to involve content elements only in the eye of the inte rpreter. B u t in this case i t is the inte rpreter who must be psychoanalyze d .

1.5·5· Sign vs. text The so-called signifying chain produces texts which carry with them the recollection of the intertextuality which nourishes the m . Texts genera te , or are capable of generating, multiple (and ultimately infi ni te) readings and i n terpretations. It was argued , for instance , by the later Barthes , by

Signs

[25]

the recent Derrida, and by Kristeva, that signification is to be located excl usively in the text. The text is the locus where meaning is produced and becomes prod uctive (signifying practice) . Within its texture , the signs of the dictionary (as codifying equivalences) can emerge only by a rigidification and death of all sense. This critical line takes up Buyssens' argu ment (communication is give n only at the level of sentence), but it goes deeper. A text is not sim ply a com m u nicational apparatu s . It is a device which questions the previou s signifying systems, often re news the m , and sometimes des troys the m . Finnegans Wake - a textua l machine made to l i q u i d a te gra m m a rs and dictionaries - is exe m p l a ry in this sense , but even rhetorical figures are produced and becom e alive only at the textual level. The textual machine empties the terms which the lit­ eral dictionary deemed u n ivocal and well defined , and fills them with new conte n t figures. Yet, the p roduction of a metaphor such as the king of the forest (where a figu re of h u m anity is added to lions and a n animal prope rty reverberates on the class of kings) implies the exis te nce of both /king/ and /lion/ as functives of two p reviously codified sign-fu nctions. I f signs (expressio ns and conte n t) did not preexist the text, every metaphor would be equivalent simply to saying that something is some­ thing. But a metaphor says that that (linguistic) thing is at the same time something else.
The ability of the textual manifestations to empty, destroy, or recon­ struct pre-existing sign-functions depends on the presence within the sign-fu nction (that is, in the network of conte n t figures) of a set of in­ structions orie nted toward the ( potential) prod uction of different texts . (This concept will be fu rther developed in 1 . 9. ) It is in this sense that the thematization of textuality has been particul arly suggestive .

1.5.6 The sign as identity The sign is supposed to be based on the categories of 'similitude' or 'identity' . This presu med fallacy re nders the sign coherent with the ideological notion of the subject. The s u bj ect as a p resupposed tran­ sce ndental unity which opens itself to the worl d (or to which the world opens) through the act of representation , as well as the subject that transfers its rep resentations onto other s u bj ects i n the process of com­ munication, is supposedly a philosophical fiction dominating all of the history of philosophy. Let us postpone the discussion of this obj ection and see now in what sense the notion of sign is seen to be coherent with the (no longe r viable) notion of s u bject:
Under the mask of socialization or of mechanistic realism, ideological lin­ guistics , absorbed by the science of signs , turns the sign-subject into a cen­ ter. The s ign-subject becomes the beginning and the end of all translin-

[26]

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

guistic actiVIty; it becomes closed up in i tself, located in its own word , which is conceived of by positivism as a kind of 'psych ism' residing in the b ra i n . (Kristeva 1 969: 69)

· The statement above implies the identification of the sign with the linguistic sign, where the l inguistic s ign is based on the equivalence model: p = q. I n point of fact, Kristeva defines the s ign as " resemblance" :

The sign brings separate instances (subject-object on one hand, subject­ interlocutor on the other) back to a unified whole (a unity which presents itself as a sentence-message) , replacing praxis with a single meaning, and difference with resemblance. . . . The relationship instituted by the sign will therefore be a reconciliation of discrepancies, and identification of difef rences.
(Ibid . , pp. 70, 84)
It see ms, however, that such a criticism can apply only to a degenerate notion of linguistic sign, rooted on the equivalence model. The problem is to see whether and to what extent this notion has ever been supported by the most mature theories of signs. For instance, the notion of sign as resemblance and identity does not appear in Peirce : "A sign is some­ thing by knowing which we know something more" (C. P. 8. 332). The sign is a n instruction for interpretation , a mechanism which s tarts from an initial stimulus and leads to all i ts illative consequences . S tarting from the sign, one goes through the whole semiotic process and arrives at the point where the sign becomes capable of contradicting i tself (otherwise, those textual mechanisms called 'literature' would not be possible). For Peirce , the sign is a potential pro posi tion (as even Kristeva [ 1 974: 43] notes). In order to comprehend this notion of sign, we need to recon­ sider the i nitial phase of its historical developme n t. Such reconsideration req uires the elimination of an embarrassing notion, that of li nguistic sign . Since this notion is after all a late cultural product, we shall postpone its treatment until later.

1.6. Signs vs. words
The term which the Wes tern philosophical tradition has translated as signum was originally the Greek semelon (u'Tip.iiov). It appeared as a technical-philosophical term in the fifth century, with Parmenides and Hippocrates. I t is often found as a synonym of tekmerion (TEKf.LTJpLov: p roof, clue, sympto m ) . A fi rst distinction between the two terms appears only with Aristotle's Rhetoric.
Hippocrates took the notion of clue from the physicians who came before him. Alcmeon said that "the Gods have immediate knowledge of invisible and mortal things , but men must 'proceed by clues'

Signs

[27]

(TEKf.Laipe6iJat)" (D. K. , B I ) . The Cnidarian physicians knew the value of symptoms . Apparently, they codified them in the form of equiva­ lences. Hippocrates maintained that the symptom is equivocal if it is not analyzed con textually, taking i n to account the air, the water, the en­ vironment, the ge neral s ta te of the body, and the regimen which is likely to modify the s i tuation. Such a model fu nctions as if to say: if p then q, but only with the concu rrence of factors y and .z . A code exists , but i t is not a univocal one.
Hippocrates was not interested in linguistic signs. In any event, it appears that a t the time the term 'sign' was n o t applied t o word s . A word was a name (onoma, ' 6vof.La) . Parmenides made use of this d i fference when he opposed the truth of the thought concerning Being to the illusory nature of opinions and the fallacy of sensations. Now, if representations are deceptive , names are nothing but equally deceptive levels superim­ posed on the obj ects that we think we know. Onoma.zein (' Ovof.La,etv) is always used by Parmenides in order to give a n arbitrary name, which is deemed to be true b u t does not actually correspond to the truth . The name establishes a pseudoequivalence with reality, and in doing so it conceals it. On the other hand , Parmenides uses the term 'signs' (semata: UTJf.LlXTa} When he speaks of evidence, of an i nferential principle: "That Being exists, there are signs" (D. K. , B 8 . 2 ) .
W i t h Plato and Aristotle words a re analyzed from a double point of view : (a) the difference between signifier and s ignified and (b) the difference between signification and reference. Signification ( that is, mean­ ing) says what a thing is, and in this sense it is a fu nction performed also by s ingle term s ; i n the act of reference one says , o n the contrary , that a thing is, and in this sense reference is a function performed only by complete sente nces . Thro ughout his whole work on logic and language , Aristotle is rel uctant to use the term sign (semeion ) for word s .
At first glance , contra ry evidence is provided b y t h e well-known page of De lnterpretatione, 1 6a , where it see m s that it is said that word s are signs. B u t this page requ ires some carefu l in terpretation . First, Aristotle says that both spoken and written words are symbols ( crof.Lf3o'A.a) of the affections of the soul . Then he says that s poken and written words a re not the same for all human beings , since (as i t is res tated i n 1 6a20 - 30) they are posited by convention. In this sense, words are different from the sounds emitted by animals. Words are conve ntional and arbitrary, whereas other kinds of sounds a re natural and motivate d . It is evident that Aristo tle reserves the term symbol for spoken and written words (see also Di Cesare 1 98 1 and Lieb 1 98 1 ) .
I t must b e noticed that symbol was a t that time, a s a philosophical term, more neu tral than sign . The notion of sign was already introduced and d iscussed by the Hippocratic tradition as a precise category, whereas

[28]

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

symbol was ge nerally used as « token» or « identifica tion mark» (see Ch ap­ ter 4 of this book) .
On the same page ( 1 6a . 5 ) , Aristotle says that the affections of the soul are likenesses, or i mages, or copies of things , and as such they cannot be studied in a logical (li nguistic) framework. Therefore they will be dealt with i n De Anima. I n stressing this difference between mental images and words, he states, incidentally, that spoken and written words are signs (semela ) of the affections of the soul. Thus prima facie he equates signs with symbols.
One could o bj ect that i n this context sign is used i n a metaphorical way. But one should m ake a more rad ical re mark. If Aristotle was follow­ ing the term inological criterion he also follows in Rhetoric, /signs/ s till means « proof» , << clue » , << sympto m » . If this is true , he is thus saying that words (spoken or written) are the proof that one has something in one's mind to express; at the same time he is stating that, even though words are sympto m s of mental affections, this does not mean that they have the same sem iotic and psychological status of these affections .
This in terpretive hypothesis is reinforced by the way in which Aris to­ tle ( I 6b. 1 9ff) wonders whether verbs as to be or not to be are s igns of the existence of the thing. H is line of thought is the following: (a) outside the sente nce , no verb can state that something really exists or actually does something; (b) verbs can perform this function only in a complete assertive sentence; (c) not even to be or not to be, uttered in isolation, assert the existence of some thing; ( d ) however, when they are inserted into a sentence , they are signs (or, as some translators interpret, " they are i ndicative of the fact" ) that the existence of something is asserted. Such an interpretation is confirmed by what Aristotle has previously said ( 1 6b . Sff) , namely, that a ve rb is always the sign (or tha t it is i ndicative of the fact) that something is said or asserted of something. Aquinas, in his co m mentary on De lnterpretatione, lucidly analyzes this passage . He ex­ cludes, however, a reading that coul d sound ve ry attractive to a contem­ porary mind, that is, that the verb is the s ignifier of which a p redication is the signified , or that the sentence that contains the verb is the vehicle of an assertive proposition. On the contra ry , Aquinas chooses a more com monsensical reading: the presence of the verb within a sentence is the proof, the sympto m that this sente nce asserts the existe nce of so me­ thing by actually p redicating something of something.
Thus we are entitled to understand that, when Aristotle incidentally uses the term sign for words, he is simply stressing that even words can be taken as symptoms. He is not equating lingu istic sym bols with natu­ ral signs. He is only saying that sometimes sym bols can be taken as proofs . B u t symbols are different from other natural signs because, when they function primarily as symbols (independently of their possible use as proofs), they are not based on the model of inference b u t on the model

Signs

[29]

of equivalence . Aristotle was in fact the fi rst to insist that linguistic terms are equivalent to their definitions and that word and definition are fully reciprocable (as we shall see in Chapter 2 of this book) .
The sign makes its appearance in the Rhetoric, where the enthymemes are said to be derived from verisimilitudes (eikota: ElKoTa) and from s igns (semefa ) . But the signs are divided into two logically well-differential categories. The first type of sign has a specific name, tekmerion, in the sense of 'evidence' . We can translate i t as necessary sign; if one has a feve r, then one is ill; if a woman has milk, then she has given birth . The necessary sign can be translated into the u n iversal statement 'all those who have a fever are ill' . I t m u s t be noted that this statement does not establish a relation of equivalence ( biconditional). One can be ill (for instance, with an ulcer) without having a fever.
The second type of sign, says Aristotle, does not have a specific name. We could call it a weak sign: if one has difficu l ty i n b reathing, then one has a feve r. The conclusion is obviously only probable, because the dif­ ficulty in b reathing co uld be caused by excessive p hysical exercise. Tra nsformed i n to a pre m is e , the sign would o nl y give a partic u l ar affirmative : 'some people have difficulty in b reathing and they have a fever' (the logical form is one of conj u nction rather than i m plication). The weak sign is such j u s t because the necessary s ign does not establish a n equivalence . A weak sign can be prod uced by conve rting the uni­ versal affi rmative - i n to which the necessary sign has been tu rned - into a particular affirmative . The subordinate of 'all those who have a fever are ill' yields in terms of a logical square , ' there are some people who are ill and who have a feve r' , which in fact is a weak sign and permits - a t most - an induction.
Actually, Aristotle is u neasy w i t h these diffe re n t types of signs. He knows the apodictic syllogism , but he does not know, at least not with theo retical clarity, the hypothetical syllogism , that is, the p ::J q form which will be the glory of the Stoics. For this reason Aristotle traces argu mentative schemes, but he does not dwell on their logical form .

1 .7. The Stoics
The S toics also ( from what can be gathered of the ir q u i te co mplex semiotics) do not seem to in tegrate clearly their theory of language and their theory of signs. I n verbal language , they distinguish clearly be­ tween semafnon (<TTJJLaivov: expression), semainomenon ( <TTJJLaLVOJLEVOV: content), and tynchanon (nryxcivov: referent). They see m to reprod uce the triad sugges ted by Plato and Aristotle, but they rework it with a theoretical subtlety lacking in m any of those who have tod ay reinvented such a semantic triangle.
The S toics analyze the m ultiple articulation of the expression and dis-

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

tinguish the simple sound e m i tted by the larynx and the articulatory muscles (an as-yet-inarticulate sound) from the articulate linguistic element and from the actual word which exists only i nsofar as it is related or relatable to a content. Such a model fu nctions as if to say, with Saussure , that the linguistic sign i s a twofold entity. Augustine, i n the wake o f the S toics , will call dictio that verbum vocis which foris sonat, bei ng at the same time perceived and recognized because it is related to a verbum mentis or cordis. The S toics thought that the barbarians were able to per­ ceive the physical so und , but u nable to recognize i t as a word . This happened, not because the barbarians l acked the corresponding mental i mage , but because they did not know the correlational rule. In this respect, the S toics go much fu rther than thei r predecessors and discover the provisional and unstable natu re of the s ign-fu nction ( the same con­ tent can make u p a word with an expression of a differe n t l a n guage ) .
W i t h S toics , t h e con tent ceases t o be, as i t w a s with their p redeces­ sors , an affection of the soul, a mental i mage , a perception, a thought or a n idea. I t is neither an idea in the Platonic sense , since the S toics have a materialistic metaphysics , nor an idea in the psychological sense, since even in this case the content would be a body, a physical fact, an altera­ tion of the soul (which is also a body), a seal impressed u pon the m i n d . Instead , the S toics s uggest t h a t t h e content is an 'incorporeal' .
The void , location, and time are incorporeals , as well as spatial rela­ tions, chronological sequences, actions, and events. The incorporeals are not things, they are s tates, modes of being. Geometric s u rfaces and the thinnest section of the cone are i ncorporeals. l ncorporeals are entia ra­ tionis insofar as every ens rationis is a relationship, a way of looking at things . Among the incorporeals the S toics put the lekton ( AEKrov), which has been translated as 'expressible' , dictum, or dicible. The /ekton is a semiotic category . The fact of Dion walking is , i n the moment of its expression, a /ekton .
The first p roblem is the relationship between the semainomenon and the lekton. I f ' Dion walks' is a proposition (and, therefore , an i ncor­ poreal), are ' Dion' and 'walks' also i ncorporeals? Sextus E m piricus iden­ tifies semainomenon and lekton as synonyms (Adv. Math . 8. 1 2) ; however, the solution appears to be more complex. The S to ics talk of complete and i ncomplete lekta. The complete lekton is a pro position, whereas the i ncomplete lekta are parts , pieces of p ropositions which are combined into the proposition through a series of syntactical links . The s u bj ect and the p redicate are listed among the incomplete lekta. They appear to be gra m m atical and lexical categories and , therefore , categories of the ex­ pressio n , but i n point of fact they are categories of the content. The subject (which is the usual translation of the word ptosis, 7TTW<Ttc;o) repre­ sents the uppermost example of case , because the attention devoted to assertive propositions caused the subject to be seen as the case par excel-

lence . B u t the case is not the inflection form (a gra m m a tical category that expresses the case). Rather, i t is the expressed or expressible co ntent. Tod ay we would say that i t i s a pure actantial position. I n this sense, the s u bj ect, principal example of inco m plete /ekton, is an i ncorporeal. The Sto ics , therefore , had already de-psychologized seman tics , so that we can translate semainomenon as "content" in Hj elmslev' s sense, that is, as a position within a syste m , the res u l t of an abstract segmentation of the noetic fiel d , a cultural u n i t (rather than a mental i mage , a thought, or an engra m ) .
When the Stoics speak of the signs (semeia ) , they seem t o refer to something im mediately evident which leads to some conclusions about the existence of something not i m mediately evident. The sign can be commemorative: i n this case it d erives from an associatio n , confirmed by preced i ng experience, between two events . On the basis of past experi­ ence I know that, if there is s moke, then there must be fire . But the s ign can also be indicative. In this case it points to something which has never been evident and probably will never be, such as the motions of the body which signify the motions of the soul, or the bodily humors which by passing thro ugh the skin i n d i ca te that there must be perce pti­ ble (but unperceived) pores. I n all these cases, the signs seem to be physical events: the smoke, the presence of milk revealing birth, the light revealing the day, and so on. Yet, the fac t that the events , the transi tory sta te of the bodies , are called i ncorporeals should give us pause. Sextus E mpiricus , in fact, does acknowledge that the sign from w h i c h the i nference is d e r i v e d i s n o t the physical eve n t , b u t the proposition which expresses it. The sign is the "antecedent proposition within a valid and larger hypothetical premise which serves the purpose of revealing its consequent" (Adv. Math. 7 . 245 ) or " a true antecedent p roposi tion w i th i n a true condition , serving the purpose of revealing i ts consequent" (Hyp. Pyrrh . 2 . 1 04).
The S toic model of sign assu mes , therefore , the for m of the infere nce (p ::J q ) , where the variables are neither physical realities nor eve nts, but the proposi tions that express the events. A colu m n of s moke is not a sign unless the interpreter sees the event as the true antecedent of a hypothetical reasoning (if there is s moke . . . ) which is related by i n fer­ ence ( more or less necessary) to i ts consequent ( . . . then there is fire ) . T h i s is why t h e S toics c a n s a y , and t h e y d o , t h a t t h e s i g n is a lekton and, therefore , a n i ncorporeal. The sign is not concerned with that smoke and that fire , but with the possibility of a relationship between antecedent and c0nsequent regulating of any occu rrence of the s moke (and of the fire ) . The sign is type, not occurrence.
By now i t i s clear how , i n the Stoics' semiotics, the theory of language becomes righ tfully associate d with the theory of signs. In order to have signs, p roposi tions must be form ulate d , a n d the p ropositions must be

[32]

SEMIOTICS AND THE PH ILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

organ ized acco rd i ng to a logical syn tax which is reflected and made pos­ sible by the linguistic syntax (see Frede 1 978) . Signs emerge only insofar as they are ratio nally expressible through the elements of language . Language is articulated inasmuch as it expresses meaningful eve n ts . I t must be stressed t h a t t h e Stoics do n o t s till say t h a t words are signs (at most they say that words serve as vehicles for types of signs). The lexical differe nce between the couple semafnon/semainomenon and the semefon re mains. B u t the common and obvious e tymological root is an indication of their related ness . We could have the Stoics say, as Lotman does, that l anguage is a primary modeling sys te m , through which the other sys tems are expresse d .
Re fe rring o n c e aga i n t o co n te m po ra ry theories ( s e e a l s o Todorov 1 977), we cou l d then say that the li nguis tic term and the natural sign are constituted by a double relation of signification , a double elevation trans­ latable into the Hj elmslevian model of connotation (in the diagra m form popularized by Barthes ; see Figure I . 1 ) .
The word /smoke/ refers to a portion of conte n t segmentation which we will conven tionally designate as « s moke » . At this point, we have three alternatives, whether intensional or extensional: (a) « S moke» con­ notes « fire » o n the basis of an e ncycloped ia-like representation which takes i n to acco unt meto nymic relationships of effect-to-cause (a case gra mma r accou n ting for 'actants' like Cause or Age n t can rep rese n t rather well this sort of meaning postulate); (b) the sente nce /there i s smoke/ expresses as its conte n t t h e proposition « there is s moke » whic h , always b y virtue of a n u nderlying e ncyclopedic re presen tation including frames or scripts (see 3 . 2 of this book), sugges ts as a reasonable infer­ e nce « there is fire » (notice that we are still at an inte nsional leve l , si nce the possibility of the inference is coded among the properties of smoke , independently o f any actual world experience ); ( c ) i n a p rocess o f refer­ e nce to states of the actual world the proposition « there is s moke•• , on the grounds of the aforementioned meaning postulates , leads to the in­ d exical proposition « therefore here there is fire » , to be evaluated i n te rms of truth values.
When I perceive a c l o u d or a col umn of smoke a s mere physical events, they do not differ from any sou nd which I can perceive without a ttributing a semantic relevance to it (as the barbarian does). But if, on the basis of a p reexisting rule, I know that s moke in general refers to fi re , then I make the event pertinent as a single expression of a more general conte n t , and the smoke I perceived becomes the perceptive con­ tent « Smoke » . This first movement, from the sensation to the percep­ tion i nvested with meaning, is so immediate that we tend to consider it as semiotically irrelevant. Gnoseology has always questioned precisely this presumed immediacy of sensation and perception .

E ven according to the medieval perspective , simplex apprehensio, that is, the first opera tion of the intellect, allows one to grasp the thing in i ts essence through the phantas m , but it is only by the act ofjudgment, that is, the second operation of the intellect, that the thing is recognized and viewed as relevant for the purpose of fu rther predicatio n s . I t is not by chance that gnoseology tal ks of the perceptive meaning where the te rm 'meani ng' seems at once a se m a n tic category and a ca tegory of the phenomenology of perceptio n . Actually, in order to grasp , from a series of sensory data, the form 'smoke' , I must already be directed by the belief that s m o ke is relevant to the making of fu rth e r infe re nces . Otherwise , the s moke p rovided for me by the sensation re mains a poten tial perception which I h ave not yet make pertine nt as smoke , but as mist, miasma, or as any exhalation which is not caused by combus­ tio n . Only if I already know the general rule which makes for 'if smoke, then fire' am I able to render the sensory datum meaningful, by seeing it as that smoke which can reveal fire .
1 .8. Unific ation of the theories and predominance of linguistics
Some centu ries later, in De Magistro, Augustine will definitely bring to­ gether the theory of signs and the theory of language . Fifteen ce ntu ries before Saussure , he will be the one to recognize the genus of signs, of which linguistic signs are a species, such as insignias, ges tures, ostensive signs. B u t in so doing Augus tine delivers to the tradition that fol lows him a problem that not even the S toics had clearly solved . Augustine had actually p rovided a solutio n , but he had failed to s tress it sufficie ntly to make it indispu table. The Stoics had left unresolved the problem of the difference be tween the relation of linguis tics expression to con te n t on t h e o n e h a n d ( w h a t Hj elmslev will c a l l denota tion) a n d t h e relation of sign-pro position to consequent meaning on the other. One suspects that the fi rst level may still be based on equivalence , while the second is doubtlessly based on inference ( Figure 1 . 2) .
However, we m u s t a s k whether or n o t this differe nce i s based on a curious 'optical illusion' . From the moment in which Augustine intro­ d uces verbal language among signs, language starts to appear in an awk­ ward positio n . Being too s trong, too finely a rticulated and therefore sci-

e ntifically analyzable (and the work of the Hellenis tic grammarians must be kep t in mind i n this respect), language could hardly be the obj ect of a theory of signs born in o rder to d escribe the relationship between natu ral events, so elusive and generic (and we will see how much the Stoics' inference was episte mologically open to a con tinuum of relationships of necessity and weakness) . Since language was i ncreasingly believed to be the semiotic syste m which could be analyzed with the most profi t (a carefu l s tudy of this aspect of the history of semiotics would be very worthwhile) and the syste m which cou l d serve as a model for all other syste ms ( translating every other semiotic o n to the plane of its conte n t) , the model of the li nguistic sign gradually came to be seen as the semiotic model par excellence .
By the time this conclusion was reached ( the definitive sanction took place with Saussure), the li nguis tic model was crys tallized into i ts 'flat­ test' form, the one e ncouraged by the dic tionaries and, u n fortunately , by a lot of form al logic which had to fill its empty symbols only for the sake of exe mpl ification as wel l . As a consequence, the notion of meaning as synonymy and as essen tial definition began to develo p .
/Man/ is equivalent t o « rational animal>> i n certain con texts , but cer­ tainly not i n the expression /mo m , there is a m a n with a package to deliver/, where the con te n t •• man>> can be a nalyzed according to many p roperties (male, u nknow n , human being, person of a low social extrac­ tio n , even foreign presence or threat), but certainly nol as a rational animal. Aristotle delivered to us the principle of ( biconditional) equiva­ lence between term and d efinition by genus and species because he worked only on categorematic terms to be inserted within assertive propo­ sition s . The S to ics , on the other hand (see Frede 1 978; Graeser 1 978), thought that every syntactic category had its semantic counterpart, including syncategorematic terms . If the complete lektti derived from the combina­ tion of incomplete ones, they had also to include conj u nc tions, articles, and p ronouns. Augustine late r shows that even prepositions have mean­ ing.

1.9. The 'instruction al' model
In De Magistro 2, Augustine a nalyzes with Adeod atus the verse by Virgil "Si nihil ex tanto superis placet urbi relinqui," and defines the eight words as "octo signa. " He then proceeds to analyze the meaning of lsi! and to

Signs

point out that this term conveys a meaning of « doubt» . And since he

knows that non esse signum nisi aliquid significet, he is forced to define the

meaning (certainly not the referent! ) of /nihil/. Granting that it is im­

possible to produce signs which do not say anyth ing, and since the

meaning of /nothing/ does not see m to be either a n object or a sta te of

the worl d , Augustine concludes that this term expresses an affection of the

soul, that is, the sta te of mind which , although not recognizing some­

thing, recognizes at least i ts absence .

Augustine then goes on to ask what lex/ means. He refuses to accep t

t h e synonymical answer, according t o which lex/ would mean «de » . This

synonym is a n i n te rpre tation that m ust in turn be i n terp re te d . The con­

clusion is that lex/ means a kind of separation (secretionem quondam ) from
that i'o which something was included. Augustine adds a further instruc­

tion for contextual d ecodi ng: the word can express separa tion from

something which has ceased to exist, as when the c i ty cited i n the l i ne

by Virgil disappeare d , or it can express separation from something which

still exists , as when one says that some merchants are coming from (ex)

Rome.

The meaning of a syncategorematic term i s , therefore , a set (a series, a

sys tem) of ins tructions for its possible contextual i nsertions and for its

d ifferent seman tic outputs i n differe n t con texts (all registered by the code).

Can this solution apply to categore matic terms as well? This is, in

poi n t of fact, the sol ution i nc reasi ngly p re ferred by context-oriented

componential semantics . The forerunners of this type of instructional

semantics were Peirce' s logic of relatives (C. P. 2. 379, 3. 66; see also E co

1 979), the various case grammars ( Fillmore 1 968; B ierwisch 1 970, 1 97 1 ) ,

the semantic models based o n con textual a n d circumstantial selections

( Eco 1 976, 2 . 1 1 ) , and their reformulation for the disambiguation of the

metaphor (see Chapters 2 and 3 of this book). The semantic type is the

description of the contexts in which the term can be expected to occur.

If this is the case , then the connoted meaning is possible because, a t

t h e first level of signification (where the li nguistic s i g n is primarily at

work), infere nce , rather than mere equivalence , is already present. A

linguistic term appears to be based on pure eq uivalence si mply because

we do not recognize in i t a 'sleeping' infere nce .

The process of recognition of natu ral events whic h generates sign­

proposi tion takes place in the same manner. Perception is always i n te r­

rogative and conditional and is invariably based (even if we do not

realize it) on a bet. If certain perceptual d a ta are p rese nt, then (there is)

perhaps s moke, as long as other contextual elements authorize me to

think that the perceptual i n terpre tation is appropriate . Peirce was aware

of the fact that perception is always p resu m p tive evidence , a source of

potential semiosis . The fact that perception takes place without effort

does not invalid ate its inferential mechanism (see C. P. 5. 266 - 68).

[36]

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

We are left 'fith the problem of the so-called substitu tional tables , that is , m i n i m a l c i p h e rs w h e re tfi e c o n te n t- p l a n e i s g i v e n by the ex­ pression-plane of another semiotic syste m . I n Morse code, for instance,
/. - I = « a » , and vice versa, with complete reciprocity . A s ubstitutional
table could be viewed as a degraded semiotic system , but in point of fact equivalence appears to be a 'sleeping' inference here as well (see C hap­ ter 7 of this book).
Therefore , there is no differe nce in the semiotic structure of fi rst- a nd seco nd-level signification (we use this dis tinction because the co uple denotation/connotation is equivocal , since 'denotation' is used by ex­ te nsional semantic theories in order to refer to truth-values). The f_luc­ tuating obj ect, which is commonly called 'sign' in so many different case s , exists as a scien tifically un ified object, constructed by the discipline which studies i t , subsuming differe n t phenomena under the same formal scheme p ::>: q.
What varies according to the phenomena is the cogency of the infer­ ence . If ( there is) the fi rst, then ( there is) the seco n d . B u t what is the episte mological val ue of if and then ?

1.10. Strong codes and weak codes
The Stoics' inference was the Philonian one, the material infere nce of modern logic. As such , it did not deal with the epistemological value of the link between a n tecedent and consequent. The S toics gave various exam ples: 'if there is d aytime , then there is light' is an equivalence (biconditional) . 'If it is d aytime, then Dion walks' is an example of ma­ terial infere nce devoid of episte mological value . 'If she gives milk, then she has given birth' is an infere nce from effect to cause based on previ­ ous inductio n s . 'If a torch is seen , then the enemy is coming' seems to be a very vague suppositio n , beca use the torc h cou l d be carried by friends as well . Sextus interprets this sign as a co nve ntional one, suppos­ ing that it is recognized on the basis of a previous agreement. At this point, the epistemological value would depend on social laws rather than o n natural laws. By i ntrod ucing, along with the example, all the com­ memorative signs among those fou nded o n an arbitrary correlatio n , Sex­ tus acknowledges the i nfe rential nature of conven tional signs. In this case , the epistemological value of if-then assumes the legalistic natu re of the norms sanctioned by juridical codes.
Aristotle, who was i n terested in fi nding argu m e n ts capable of explain­ ing the necessary l i n ks between facts , posi ted a numbe r of epistemologi­ cal disti nctions between necessary signs and weak signs. The S toics, w h o were o n ly i n te re s te d i n the fo rmal m e c h a n i s m s of i n fe re n c e , avoided t h e p roble m . O n l y Quintilian (lnstitutio aratoria 5. 9), w h o was

Signs

[37]

i n terested i n the reactions of a forensic audience, tried to accou n t for every type of persuasive sign accord i ng to an epistemological hierarchy.
Quintilian does not disagree with Aristotle's classification in the Rhetoric, b u t he warns that necessary signs can deal with the past (if she has give n birth she must have been with a man), with the present (if there is a strong wind on the sea, there must necessarily be waves) and with the fu tu re (if one has been stabbed i n the heart, one will necessar­ ily die).
Clearly, though, these presumed temporal links are i n truth d i ffere n t combinations of cause-effec t l i n k s . T h e l i n k between giving birth a n d s e x u a l i n te rcou rse (diagnostic s i g n ) goes b a c k from the effect t o the cause , while the link between wou nd and death (prognostic sign) goes from the cause to its possible effects . However, this distinction is not homologous to the distinction betwee n necessary signs and weak signs. Every cause does not necessarily refer us forward to all its possible ef­ fects (weak prognostic sign), and not all effects necessarily refer us back to the same cause (weak d i agnostic sign) . Who carries the torch, the enemy or the allies? A distinction should also be made between necessary causes and sufficient causes. Oxygen is a necessary cause for combustion (so that if there is combustio n , then there is oxygen), but the striking of a match is only a sufficient cause for co mbustion (in occu rrence with other possible causes) . One could then say that Aristotle' s weak sign goes from effect to sufficient cause (if one has a hard time b reath ing, then one has a feve r) ; but, when better examined , the weak sign also exhibits a de­ gree of 'necessity' - excep t that this sign refers to a class of causes , rathe r than to one cause ; if there is a to rch, then someone must have lit it and must be carrying it. If there is difficulty in breathing, then necessar­ ily there is an alteration of the cardiac rhythm (a class of events which includes also fever) . These types of signs should have a necessary conse­ q uent, but the consequent is still too wide and it must be narrowed (passage from the class to a member of the class) on the basis of other contextual i nfere nces (as H ippocrates knew q u i te well).
In verbal language a similar process takes place , since I can name an entity by synecdoche from ge nus to species . Instead of saying 'human beings' , I can say 'mortals' .
The prognos tic sign from cause to effect i nvolves a n u m ber of prob­ lems as wel l . Thomas Aquinas says (Summa Theologiae 1 . 70. 2 - 2 ; 3 . 62) that the instrumental cause can be a sign of its possible effec�: if the h a m mer, then the operations that it can be expected to perform . This is how the police operate . If weapons are found in an apartment, their possible criminal usage is deduce d . This type of sign is obviously open to contextual inferences . The natu re of the clue changes, depending upon whether the weapons are fou n d i n the house of a presu med te r-

[38]

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

rorist, of a police officer, or of a gunsmith. And why does Aquinas not mention, for instance, the efficient cause ? Cannot the presence of a well-known m u rderer in town be a sign of crim inal inte n t on his or her part? As for the final cause, is i t not the basis for the cui prodest type of argumentation?
I t appears , then , t h a t a l l prognostic signs are weak because of the episte mological natu re of inference ( the link is not a necessary one), whereas all diagnostic signs can be weak because of the generality of the implicatum ( the class of the consequents is too wide). Today episte mol­ ogy, inductive logic, and probability theory know how to measure the various d egrees of episte mological force. One might ask why Aris totle and, above all, Quintilian did not hesitate to list as possible evidence every type of s ign, even though they were aware of their differe n t epis­ temological force . B u t, a t the rhetorical level, links are mostly based on conventions and com mon opinions. Quintilian cites as verisimilar the fol­ lowing argument: if Atalanta goes walking in the wood s with boys , then she is probably not a virgin any more . I n certain com munities this ver­ isimilitu d e · can be as convincing as a necessary s ign. I t depends on the codes and on the scripts (cf. Eco 1 979) which the community registe rs as 'good' .
The hiatus between 'scientific' certitude and 'social' certitude consti­ tutes the differe nce between scientific hypotheses and laws, on the one hand , and semiotic codes , on the other. The necessity of scientific evi­ dence has little in common with the necessity of semiotic evidence. Sci­ entifically, the whale is a mammal, but in many people's compete nce it is a fish. Scientifically, a lemon is necessarily a citrus fruit, and it is not necessarily yellow. B u t for a reader of poetry ( Montale: "The golden tru m pets of solarity " ) , the lemon is a yellow fruit, and its being a citrus is irrelevant.
Therefore, at the semiotic level, the conditions of necessity of a sign are socially determined, either according to weak codes or accord i ng to s trong codes. In this way, an eve n t can be a sure s ign , even though scien­ tifically it is not so. This hierarchy of semiotic necessity s upports the correlational li nks between antecedents and conseque n ts , and renders them as s trong as the correlations between expression and con tent.
A typology of the various coding levels can be found in E co ( 1 976, c h . 3), with a theory o( t h e modes of sign p roduction. This review of the possibili ties of sign prod uction shows that there is a semiosic conti nuum which goes from the s trongest kind of coding to the mos t open and i nde­ terminate . The task of a general semiotics is that of tracing a s ingle formal s tructure which underlies all these phenomena, this s tructure being that of the inference which generates i n terpretation .
The task of specific semiotics , on the other hand , will be that o f

establish ing - accord ing to the sign system in question - the rules of

greater or lesser sem iotic necessity for infe rences (institutional ization

ru l es ) .

When - still in semiotic terms - the class of the consequents is very

imprecise , we have a sign which is either not yet coded , vaguely coded

( the 'symbol' ) , or in the process of being coded (see Eco 1 979, ch. 3 for

the process of code inve n tio n ; and Chapter 4 of this book) . Usually,

code invention takes the form of the most d aring of i nfe rences , that of

abduction or hypothesis.

1.11. Abduction and inferential nature of signs
Compared to ded uction and inductio n , abd uction gives rise to three dif­ feren t infe rential schemes ( Figu re 1 . 3 ) , where the solid-line boxes indi­ cate propositions which are already verified and where the broken-line boxes indicate ten tative propositions prod uced i n the process of reason­ ing.
I f signs were rooted i n mere equivalence, their understanding would represent a simple case of modus ponens: every time one u tters /man/ one means « rational mortal animal>• . But one utte red /man/; therefore , one meant « rational mortal animal » . This is in fact the absolu tely deductive process we implement when dealing with s u bs titutional tables , as it happens with the dots and dashes of the Morse alphabet. But it does not seem that we do the same with all the other signs, that is, when we are not invited to recognize the conventional equivalence between two ex­ pressions belongi ng to two different semiotic systems, but when we have to decide what conte n t should be correlated to a given expression.
If we did not know the meaning of a sign and had to reconstruct it th rough repeated experiences , the correct process to develop would ap­ pear to be of an inductive type. Apparently, this is how ostensive defini­ tions work. E ach time a native speaking a language unknown to us u tters the expression /x/, he or she either points to the o bj ect Y or there is a recu rrence of experience Y . Therefore , that word can reaso nably be in­ terpreted as meaning that class of objects or of actions. The ind uction by ostensive inte rpretation is shown to be very p recarious by Augustine in De Magistro. When Augus tine asks Adeodatus how he would explain the meaning of the verb /to walk/ , Adeodatus answers that h e would s tart walking. And when Augustine asks him what he would do if the ques­ tion were posed to him while walking, Adeodatus answers that he wou l d s tart walking fas ter. Augustine t h e n replies that t h e answer coul d be unders tood to mean that the sense of /to walk/ is « to hurry u p» . Obvi­ ously, the accumulation of ostensive s igns does not clarify the meaning of a term by simple induction. A frame of reference is necessary, a

But at this point we have already arrived a t the mechanism of abd uction.

linguistic terms as well, when one is uncertain about what language they

belong to. When someone tells me /cane ! / in an excited voice, in order

to understand whether it is a Latin imperative ( « sing! » ) or an Italian

holophrastic indexical proposition ( « dog! » ) , I must hypothesize a lan­

guage as a frame of refe rence . The fact that there are circu mstantial and

contextual clues to direct me toward the determination of the rule does

tem of signification rules which will allow the sign to acquire its mean­

mg.

Abduction occurs with those natural signs which the Stoics called indi­

cative and which are thought to be signs , yet without knowing what they

signify. Kepler noticed that the orbit of Mars passes th rough points x and

y ( this example is given by Peirce, C. P. 2 . 96): this was the Result, but

the Rule of which this was a Case was not yet known (the consequents

of this antecedent being, therefore , equally u nknown). Points x and y

could have been points of, among other possible geometrical figures , an

ellipse. Kepler hypothesized the Rule (and this was an act of imaginative

courage ) : they are the poin ts of an ellipse . Therefo re , if the orbit of

Mars were i n point of fact elliptica l , then its passing through x and y

( Result) would have been a case of that Rule. The abduction, of course,

had to be verified . I n the light of the hypothesized rule, x and y were

'signs' of the further passage of Mars th rough the points z and k . I t was

obviously necessary to wait for Mars at the spot where the fi rst 'sign' had

led one to expect its appearance . Once the hypothesis was verified , the abduction had to be widened (and verified): the behavior of Mars was hypothetically thought to be shared by all the other planets. The be­ havior of a planet thus became a sign for the general behavior of planets .
Abd uction i s a v e ry complex mode o f inference, and there are p rob­ ably many types of abduction, ranking from the simplest and easiest to the more complex and tentative . Thagard ( 1 978) has d istinguished be­ tween hypothesis and abd uction in connection with the distinction be­ tween overcoding and undercoding ( E co 1 976, 2. 14); Bonfantini and P roni ( 1 983) have outlined three types of abduction , and I have elabo­ rated on this p roposal (Eco 1 983). The three types of abduction I shall outline here represent a typological abs traction, a sort of rough segmen­ tation of a more finely segmentable continuum. I n othe r word s , one could fi nd concrete examples of abd uction which cover intermediate positions between the first and the second or between the second and the third types , as well as complex p rocesses that combine these differ­ ent types .

(a) There is a hypothesis or an overcoded obduction when the law is given automatically or quasi-automatically. This 'quasi' is to be take n very serio usly. Let us suppose that a verbal language represents a sys te m of absolute equivalences and that in this language /man/ stands for
« rational mortal animal >• . When someone utters /man/, I must firs t as­ sume that this u tterance is the token of a type of E ngl ish word . It seems that usually we do this kind of interpretive labor automatically, but it is enough that we are l iving in an international milieu i n which people are supposed to speak different languages, and we realize that our choice is not completely an automatic one. To recognize a given phenomenon as the token of a given type p resu pposes some hypothesis about the cir­ cumstances of utterance , the nature of the speaker, and the discursive co-text. Thagard suggests that this kind of hypothesis corresponds to my notion of overcoding and says that, si nce the ru le is already give n , the infe rence concerns only the decision to recognize the Resu l t as the Case of that Rul e . I agree, but I insist on the fact that, since one has to decide to connect that Rule with that Res u l t thro ugh the mediation of the Case, then the process is never fully auto matic .
Abductions of this type a re also i m plemented in co-textual inte rpreta­ tion. The exa mple provided by Augustine apropos of ex (see 1 . 9) repre­ sents an interesting instance of s uch an inferential process. Augustine knew that /ex/ meant the separation of something from something else; he still had to decide how to identify the two terms of this relationship within the co-text he was interpreting. His decision was quasi-au tomatic; however, he had to figu re out a hypothesis - even though a hard ly chal­ lengeable one.

[42 ]

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

(b) There IS an undercoded abduction when the rule must be selected among a series of equi probable alte.rnatives. I n Chapter 2 of this book it is maintained that our semantic rep resentations do not follow the model of a dictionary but of an encyclopedia. Therefore, we have no guarantees that the meaning of /man/ is necessarily, and in every context, « rational mortal animal,, . Accord ing to d i fferent contextual and c i rcums tantial selections (see Eco 1 976, 2 . I I ), a man also can be a very v i rile person , a
brave male, a two-footed creature , and so on. Therefore , when one u t­ ters /this is a man/, we h ave to decide whether one says that this is a rational animal , a mortal creature, or a good example of virility , and so on. L ikewise, /th is is not a man/ can mean either << this is not rational » or << this is not mortal » , depending on whether the se ntence is about a monster p rod uced by Doctor Frankenste i n or about an ange l . The deci­ sion as to whether certain properties ( belonging to the meaning of a term) must be blown up or narcotized (see Eco 1 979 and Chapte r 2 of this book) represents a good case of u ndercoded abduction. Thagard calls this kind of reasoning an abduction stricto sensu: the rule selected can be, in a given co-text, the most plausible one, but it is not certain whether i t is the most correct or the only correct one . Thus the explana­ tion is entertained, waiting for furthe r tests .
A case of undercoded abd uction , working for nonl inguistic signs, is the one of Kepler' s discovery , quoted above. Kepler met a su rprising fact, and then he had to select among alternative explanations : the re were many geometrical curves that could account for the movement of Mars. Their number was not infinite , and some p revious assumptions about the regu larity of the universe suggested to Kepler that he had to look o n ly fo r close d , nontra nscendenta l c u rve s ; there fo re , e l l i p s i s seemed more plausible than spyrals or sinewaves. Notwith standing this hierarchy of plausibilities, Kepler had to try.

(c) There a re , finally, cases of creative abduction , in which the rule acting as an explanation has to be invented ex novo. This could be the case of Copernicus when he had the intu i tion of heliocentrism in De revolu­ tionibus orbium coelestium. Copernicus felt that the Ptolemaic system was inelegant, without harmony, like a painting in which the painter repro­ d uced all the members without composing them into a unique body. Then he decided that the sun ought to be at the center of the u niverse because only in this way the created world would have displayed an admirable symmetry. He figured out a possible world w hose guarantee was i ts being wel l structured , 'gestaltically' e legant. As in every case of creative abduction, this way of reasoning required a sort of meta­ abduction, which consisted in deciding whether the possible universe (or state of things) outlined by the c reative abduction was the same as the ' real' universe. I n over- and undercoded abduction this metalevel of in-

Signs

[43 ]

ference is not compulsory, because there are preexisting explanations of the same kind that have already p roved to be plausible in other case s . I n other words, in over- a n d undercoded abd uctions o n e uses explanations that already held for d i fferent results . In c reative abductions one is not sure that the explanation one has selected is a 'reasonable' one.
We i mplement creative abd uction when dealing with poetic texts , as well as when solving criminal cases. Many interpretive decisions con­ cerning symbols (see Chapter 4 of this book) involve creative abduc­ tions. Many cases in which language is used not to confirm but to chal­ lenge a given world view or a scien tific paradigm , and to decide that certain properties cannot belong any longer to the meaning of a given term (see Chapter 2 of this book) require an interp retive cooperation that displays many characteristics of a c reative abduction.

So far, inferences a re at work at every l evel of semiosis , in verbal l anguage as well as in the understanding of so-called natural signs . In this sense, the re is a link between theory of meaning and theory of evi­ dence that, accord ing to H a rman (see I .4 a bove) , is to be carefully dis­ tingu ished . I f there is a difference , i t is not between linguistic and natu­ ral signs or between words and symptoms, but rather between semiotic and scientific inference , or between two kinds of certitude.
The semiotic plausibility is based on social habits , whereas the scien­ tific plausibility is based on other criteria of verifiability. This difference is of the greatest relevance under many respects , indeed . B u t it should not blur that other evidence: that we deal both with language and with every other kind of sign by implementing inferential p rocesses . These p rocesses can be defined as interpretive processes. The u nders tand ing of signs is not a mere matter of recognition (of a stable equivalence); it is a matter of interpretation .

1 . 1 2 . The criterion o f interpretability
Thus s!lbstitu tion (aliquid stat pro aliquo ) is not the only necessary con­ dition for a sign : the possibility of interpretation is necessary as wel l . By interpretation (or crite rion of interpre tability) we mean the concept elaborated by Peirce, accord ing to which every interpretant (either a s ign or an expression or a sequence of expressions which translate a previous expression), besides translating the Immediate Obj ect or the conte n t of the sign, also increases our understanding of it. The criterion of inter­ p retability allows us to start from a sign in order to cover, step by step, the entire circle of semiosis. Peirce maintained that a term is a rud imen­ tary proposition and that a proposi tion is a rudimentary a rgumentation (C. P. 2 . 342 - 44) . By sayi ng father I have already produced a two­ argu ment predicate : if father, then so meone who is a child of this father.

[44]

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

The i nterpreted content allows me to go beyond the original sign and

makes me see the need for fu ture contextual occu rrence of another sign.

From the proposition 'every father has or has had a child ' , one can go o n

t o a nalyze whole argumentative topics , while t h e intensional mechanism

leads u s i n the direction of propositions to be analyzed extensionally.

At this point it is clear that the death sente nce pronounced on the sign

o n the basis of the charges of equality, similitude, and reduction of

d ifferences was quite u nfounded. It based itself o n the blackmail of a

'flat' linguistic sign, seen as a type of correlation based on dead-end

equivalence, on the substitution of the same. In truth, the sign always

opens up something new. No interpretant, in adj usting the sign interpre t­

ed, fails to change its borders to some d egree.

To i n terpret a sign means to define the portion of continuum which

serves as i ts vehicle in its relationship with the other portion s of the

continuum derived from its global segmentation by the content. It

means to define a portion through the use of other portions, conveyed by

other expressions. If the interpretation is p ushed to i ts extreme, it is

possible to cast doubt on the content determined at the beginning, and

even the global criterion of segmentation. This implies that we must cast

doubt on the way in which the form of the content has segmented the

continuum.

Hj el mslev leads us t o believe in t h e existence of two separate con­

tinua, one for the expression and one for the con tent. But the sign­

function model shoul d , in the light of Peirce's semiotics , be reformu­

lated ( Figure 1 . 4) . The matter, the continuum about which and through

which signs speak, is always the same . I t is the Dynamic Obj ect that

Peirce talked about that motivates the sign , though the sign does not

render it immediately, since its expression only conveys an Immediate

Obj ect ( the content) . A specific civilization organizes the conte n t in the

shape of field s , axes, subsystems, and partial systems which are often

not cohere n t with each other. They are articul ated accord i ng to a specific

contextual perspective (and the context can be the cul ture of a millen­

nium as well as a poem or a diagram). These con tent-segmen ts can cor­

respond to physical entities (woman , dog, house), abstract concepts

(goo d , evil), actions (to run , to eat), genera and species (animal, plane

figure ) , as well as d i rections and relations (above , before , toward , if and

the n , or). These portions are articulated i n larger sequences according to

the inferential l inks we described above . I n order to express them , one

must choose formalized or formalizable portions of the con tinuum, which

ore the some as what is talked about, that is, the same con tinuum seg­

men ted by the content. Sometimes the material elements , chosen in

order to express them, the expressed continuu

relations) . At other times the same portion of the conti n u u m is used as material both for the expression and for the content (spatial relationships in a diagram used to express spatial relationships on a tridimensional s u rface) .

FIGURE 1 .4
The matter segmented in order to express something expresses other segmentations of that matter. Through this interplay from sign to sign, the world { the continuum, the pulp itself of the matter which is manipu­ lated by semiosis) is called into question. The form that we attribu te to the Dynamic Object is continuously changed through the formu lation of I mmediate Obj ects and their constant redefinition by successive inter­ pretants .
1 . 1 3. Sign and subject
The notion of s ign as expression o f e q u a l i ty and identi ty c o u l d be legitimately claimed to support a sclerotic (and ideological) notion of the subject. The sign as the locus (constantly inte rrogated ) for the semiosic process constitutes , on the other hand, the instrument through which the s u bject is continuously made and unmade. The s u bj ect ente rs a beneficial crisis because it shares in the historical (and constitutive) c risis of the sign . The subject is constantly reshaped by the end less resegmen­ tation of the content. In this way (even though the process of resegmen­ tation must be activated by someone, who is probably the collectivity of s u bj ects), the s u bject is spoken by language (verbal and nonverbal), by the dynamic of sign-functions rather than by the chain of signifiers . As s u bjects , we are what the shape of the world produced by signs m akes us become.
Perhaps we are , somewhere , the deep impulse which generates semiosis. And yet we recognize o u rselves only as semiosis in p rogress , signifying syste m s a n d c o m m u n icational p rocesses . The m a p of semiosis , as defined at a given stage of historical development (with the d ebris carried over from previous semiosis), tells us who we are and what (or how) we think.

2.1. Porphyry strikes back
2 . 1 .1 . Is a definition an interpretation? The aim of this chapter is to demonstrate the untenabili ty of that model for definitio n , s tructured by genera , species, and differe ntiae , known as the Porphyrian tree and elaborated from Boeth ius through the whole
Middle Ages, as a n interpre tation of the lsagoge written by the Phoeni­ cian Porphyry i n the third century A. D . I t would seem preposterous to criticize such a venerable and outdated theory . B u t every revisitation of the histo ry of signs is frui tful , because it helps to discover the remote origins of some contemporary theoretical 'cramps' . Porphyry is s till alive in many semantic theories.
A sign is not only something which stands for something else; it is also something th a t can and must be inte rpre ted . The c ri terion of i n te r­ pretability allows us to start from a given sign to cover, step by s tep , the whole universe of semiosis.
This criterion (as we have s hown in the firs t chapter of this book) held for the classical notion of natural signs, based o n an infe rential model (p :> q ) , but it s hould hold also for linguistic signs , even though they were based , by a long historical tradition, on the model of equivalence (p = q). This latter idea of sign as identity was d ue to the persuasion that the meaning or the content of a given linguistic expression was either a syn­ onymous expression or its definition. I rrespective of whether the defini­ tion is provided by genus and d ifferentia (/man/ = « rational mortal animal » ) or by a series of semantic componen ts or markers (/man/ = « human + male + adult» ) , there should be a biconditional link between definiens and definiendum . One can say that not even this model excludes

an interpretive process: undou btedly « rational mortal animal » says some­ thing more than the verbal utterance /man/, especially if ' mortal' , 'ra­ tional' , and 'animal' are in terpreted in their turn . However, every deci­ sion a bou t this matter concerns the choice between a dictionary and an encyclopedia, a crucial question widely d iscussed in the course of the last decades (see, for instance , Wilson 1 967; Katz 1 972 ; Putnam 1 975; Rey-Debove 1 97 1 ; a n d , for t h e most complete a n d convincing overview of the problem, Haiman 1 980). Naturally, one must distinguish between the opposition dictionary/encyclopedia as it is intended in the publishing world and the same opposition as conceived in semiotic or philosophical terms . I t suffices to read some of the analyses of the current dictionaries and encyclopedias (see, for instance, Weinreich 1 980; Rey-Debove 1 97 1 ) to realize that, i f so-called encyclopedias are i n some way encyclopedic, so-called d ictionaries are rather impoverished encyclopedias .
If one consults the 1 974 edition of the Merriam-Webster d ictionary, one finds that /bull/ is defined as an << adult male bovine animal, ( a definition that would titillate every fan of a semiotic dictionary); but /tiger/ is defined as « a large tawny black striped Asiatic flesh-eating mammal related to cat» , and this definition is as if it were conceived to s upport Putnam's idea of 'ste reotypes' .

:z.I.:z. The idea of a diction ary The first semiotician to outline the idea of a d ictionary was probably Hjelmslev. After having analyzed expressions into minor elements or figurae so that "u nres tricted inventories are resolved into restricted" ( 1 943 : 7 1 ) , he tried to d o the same for the content-plane. If the analysis of the expression-plane consists "in the resol ution of entities that ente r unrestricted inventories (e.g. , word-expressions) into e n ti ties t h a t e nter restricted inven tories, and this resolu tion is carried on until only the most restricted inventories remain" (ibid . ), the same p roced u re must be followed for the content plane:
While the i nventory of word-con tents is u n restricted, i n a language of famil­ iar structures even the minimal signs will be distributed (on the basis of relational differences) i n to some (selected) inventories , which are u n re­ stricted (e. g. , inve n tories of root-con tents), and other (selecting) i nven tories, which are restricted (e. g. , i nventories embracing contents of derivational and inflexional elements, i. e. , derivatives and morphemes). Thus i n practice the procedure consists i n trying to analyze the entities that enter the unre­ stricted inventories purely i n to entities that enter the restricted inventories. (Ibid . )
The example given b y Hjelmslev concerns a series o f word-contents corresponding to the common nouns ram, ewe, man, woman, boy, girl,

stallion, more, sheep, human being, child, and horse and to the p ronouns he and she. Hj e l m slev reduces the inventory in a way that can be repre­ sented by the d i agram in Figure 2. I . He though t that the word-contents of the expressions horse, sheep, human being, and child belonged to u n re­ stricted inventories, while she and he belonged to a category "with a re­ stricted number of members ."

Hjelmslev's p roposal see ms to account for some linguistic phenomena that, according to the furthe r semantic literature , should be explained by a d ictionary. I f a dictionary concerns purely our l i nguistic knowledge without giving instructions as to how to use linguistic terms in order to mention things o r sta tes of the world, Hjel mslev's dictionary u ndou bt­ edly explains why such sentences as o ewe is o female sheep and if x is o ewe then x is not o stallion are semantically well formed , even though the user of that language never had a d i rect acquaintance with a sheep or with a stallion. I n fact, other dictionary theories , i n order to provide instructions for reference, p rovide anothe r kind of information; see, for instance , the idea of 'distinguishers' in Katz and Fodor ( 1 963) and the reformulation of th is p rinciple in Katz' s 'neoclassical theory of refe rence' ( 1 979).
Hjelmslev' s dictionary seems to explain (as usu ally requested to a dic­ tionary) at least the fol lowing phenomena: (a) synonymy and paraphrase ( a ewe is a female sheep ) ; (b) similarity and d ifference (rom /stallion, ewe/more, and stallion/more have a common semantic component, but in a different respect a stallion is d iffere n t from a m a re , and a mare is different from a ewe ) ; (c) antonymy (girl/boy ) ; ( d ) hyperonymy and hyponymy (horse/stallion ) ; (e) meani ngfu l ness and semantic anomaly (stallions ore mole makes sense, whereas o female stallion is anomalous); (f) semantic ambigu i ty (a more complete diction a ry should explain the pos­ sible ambigu i ty between rom as male sheep and rom as a warship); (g) red u ndancy ( unfortu nately in such a limited dictionary red u ndancy coincides with meaningfu l ness; o mole rom is both meaningful and re­ d u ndant); (h) analytic truth ( for the same reason as above roms ore mole is at the same time meaningfu l , redu ndant, and analytically true, since the meaning of the subject contains the meaning of the predicate); (i) con­ tradictoriness (roms ore female); (j ) syntheticity (the diction a ry recognizes expressions such as sheep provide wool as depending on o n e ' s world knowledge); (k) inconsiste ncy (this is o rom and this is a ewe cannot be

true at the same time if referred to the same individual); (I) containment and semantic entailment: these two phenomena are strictly dependent on each other since , by virtue of the dictionary , every term is supposed to 'contain' certain properties; on the basis of these semantic rules (and independently of any other logical law) the sentence this is a ram entails this is a sheep, the sentence this is not a sheep entails this is not a ram, and the sentence this is not a ram leaves u n p rej ud iced whether this is a sheep or not.
I have seve rely limited my list of requirements for a d ictionary (other au thors i n trod uce more controve rsial req uire me n ts ; see, for instance , Katz 1 972, 5 - 6). I n a ny case, Hj elmslev's proposal for a dictionary leaves unsolved two importa n t q uestions: how to define the meaning of the components or figurae (in other word s , if ram means male sheep, what does sheep mean?) and how to obtain a finite or u n restricted inven­ tory.
Let us first consider the second problem . The most rigorous support­ ers of a theoretical d ictionary maintain that the meaning of linguistic expressions should be represented through a finite n u m ber of semantic primitives (components , markers , prope rties , universal concepts ) .
It is n o t strictly necessary t o assume t h a t t h e set of definienda be a finite one. Naturally, the ideal condition for a d ictionary is th at this dic­ tionary, being "the reconstruction of an aspect of the speaker' s semantic competence," stori ng "only fi n i tely many bits of information about a particu lar lexical i te m ," be "a fi n i te list of e n tries" so that "each e ntry consists of a fi nite number of lexical read ings , and that each lexical read­ ing contains a fi nite nu mber of semantic markers" (Katz 1 972 : 5 9 - 6o) . However, it is theoretically possible to conceive of a consistent number of primitives whose combination permits the description of an open "number of definienda.
At this point the problems a re (a) how to determine the pri m itives and (b) how to guarantee that their number be a fi nite one . As far as the determination of the primitives is concerned, the discussion is still open. Haiman ( 1 980) remarks that (according to the curren t p hilosophical and semiotic literature) these primitives can be iden tified only i n three ways :

(a) Primitives are 'simple' (or the 'simplest' ) concepts . I t is, however, very hard to decide what a 'simple' concept is. In terms of the speaker' s intuition, ' hu man' is s i m pler than 'mammal' (since every speaker is able to tell whether something or somebody is a human being o r not, whereas we have problems i n telling whether a dolphin is more a ' mammal' than a platypus). I t must be clear that i n this case 'simpler' or 'simplest' does not mean more general; therefo re , 'simplest' concepts risk being more numerous than the 'complicated' ones. It is true that it is not necessary

[SO]

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

that the primitives be less than the definienda: "a phonological featu res analysis ,would not be invalidated by the discovery that there a re more featu res than phonemes in some language" ( Dean Fodor 1 977: 1 47). However, this remark can hold in phonemics , since a language has a finite number of phonemes. B u t if a language has a potentially open number of expressions to be defined , can one accept that this open series be defined by a series of primitives that is indefinitely open as wel l ? Moreover, the quest for 'simple' concepts leads one· to the second way, and the strictu res holding for the latter also hold for the former.

(b) The primitives are rooted in our world experience , that is, they are 'obj ect words' (in the sense of Russell 1 940) . The meaning of an obj ect word is given by d irect ostension of a state of the worl d , that is, of things that we meet in the course of our experience . A child learns by ostension what red means. On the contrary, there are 'dictionary words' that must be defi ned i n terms of other d ictionary word s . I t is , however, difficult to ascertain whether a word is an 'obj ect' or a 'dictionary' one; as Russell remarks, pentagram is to most people a d ictionary word , but to a child brought up i n a house decorated with pentagrams it might be an object word ( 1 940: 70) . Wierzbicka ( 1 972 : 2 1 ) lists among o bject words sea, river, field, wood, cloud, mountain, wind, table, house, book, paper, bird, fish, in­ sect, plant, animal, cat, apple, rose, birch, gold, salt, and so on - a very 'open' series, indeed, which reminds one of the open list of 'natu ral kinds' conj u red u p by the theories of ' rigid designation' (Kripke 1 972; Putnam 1 975 ) . B u t , once one has decided to go on i n this directio n , the list of primitives cannot be a finite one. Moreove r, the idea of a l i s t of semantic primitives is devised in order to conceive of a dictionary-like compete nce free of any commitment to world knowledge , but, if one takes the option (b), then the d ictionary compete nce is entirely depen­ dent on the world knowledge .

( c ) The primitives are Platonic ideas . This position is philosophically impeccable , but there is a histo rical (and therefore empirical) inconveni­ ence : not even Plato succeeded in limiting in a satisfactory way the sys­ tem of these universal and innate ideas . E ither there is an idea for every 'natural kind' , and the dictionary is not finite , or there are few very general ideas (One, Good , Multipl icity, and so on), and they do not succeed in distinguishing the meaning of any single expression.

One can, however, conceive of a fourth and more theoretical way. Suppose there is the possibility of establishing a system of primitives such that, by virtue of their systematic relationship, they must be finite in number. I f one's mind succeeds in doing th is, this can be taken as proof that s uch a systematic arrangement in some way 'mirrors' the s truc­ ture of the human mind ( and p robably also the structu re of the world).

Fortu nately, w e have a good example o f such a syste m : it is repre­ sented by a purely lexical system of hyponyms and hyperonyms organ­ ized in the format of a tree such that every n-tuple of hyponyms postu­ lates a si ngle hyperonym , and every n -tuple of hyperonyms becomes an n-tuple of hyponyms of a higher si ngle hyperonym , and so on, until the point where , irrespective of the n u m ber of hyponyms to be classified at the lower row of the tree, the tree necessarily tapers at a single u pper­ most node. Figu re 2 . 2 represents a tree of this kind by simply reorganiz­ ing the terms provided by Hjelmslev. One can say that ewe contains or comprises 'sheep' and ( by a transitive property of this classification) con­ tains or comprises 'animal' . One can also say that this tree represents a sys te m of meaningpostulates in the sense of Carnap ( 1 974) . In fact, if the form of a meaning postulate is

(x) (Sx ::>: Ax ) ,

the fact that x is a sheep postulates t h e fact t h a t x is o n animal and this is a sheep entails this is on animal.

FIGURE 2.2
A s e t o f meaning postulates i s , however, different from the system of Figu re 2 . 2 . Carnap's form ula holds even though S stands for raven and A stands for block. According to this meaning postulate , if this is a raven, this is block is an instance of analytic truth, and , if there was not a meaning postulate establishing that sheep are animals, this sheep is on animal would be an example of synthetic or factual truth . A set of meaning postulates is established on ' pragmatic' grounds (cf. Lyons 1 977 : 204) and does not distinguish between encyclopedia and dictionary (see Carnap 1 947).
The system of Figure 2. 2 represents, on the contrary, an ordered set of meaning postulates, because it is hierarchically structured; for this reason it must be fi nite . One can think that it can be so because the way in which a lexicon of a natural langu age establishes relationships of hypo/ hyperonomy reprod uces some (as yet mysterious) structure of the hu man mind. Fortu nately, one can disregard such a tremendous question. In any case, the sys te m of Figure 2 . 2 (even were it ' true' or 'natu ral' or 'universal' ) is not an instance of a ' powerful' dictionary. Its inconveni­ ences are the following: (a) it does not say what sheep or animal means (once again it does not explain the meaning of figurae) ; (b) it does not

[52]

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

help one to distinguish a ram from a ewe, since both are sheep and animals ; (c) it does account for such phenomena as hyperonomy, hyponymy, meani ngful ness and anomaly, red u ndancy, analytic truth , con trad ictoriness , i nconsistency, containment, and e n tailment, b u t i t does n o t account f o r such phenomena as synonymy, paraphrase, and semantic difference.
To conclude, the tree of Figure 2 . 2 cannot provide the means for giv­ ing definitions. As Aristotle knew very wel l , there is a good definition when, in order to iden tify the essence of something, one selects attri­ butes such that, although each of them has wider extension than the s u bject, all together they have not (Post. An. 2 . 96a. 35 ) . There must be fu ll reciprocability between definiendum and definiens.
S u p posing th a t /ram/ can be defined as the only « horned male sheep» , then not only does this is a ram entail this is a horned male sheep b u t also this is a horned male sheep entails this is a ram as well as this is not a ram entails this is not a horned male sheep, and vice versa. Definiens and deftniendum can be substituted for each o ther in every con text.
This cannot happen with the tree of Figu re 2 . 2 . Not only does this is an animal sheep not entail this is o ram, bu t also x is my preferite rom does not entail this is my preferite animo/, all roms ore horned does not entail all animals are horned, a n d , if one deletes the hypony m , one does not neces­ sarily delete the hyperonym .
Thus w e must now th ink of a different system that, while displaying the same 'good' characteristics of the tree of Figure 2 . 2 , is also able to account for the phenomena that the latter leaves u nsolved. Let u s try, then , a second tree (Figure 2 . 3 ) , which in some way rep roduces the procedu re used by natu ral ists i n order to classify animal species .
I t is c e r ta i n l y i m p r u d e n t to e q u a te l i n g u i s ti c i n v e n t o r i e s w i t h taxonomies i n natu ral sciences: Dupre ( 1 98 1 ) h a s demonstrated n o t only that, where a layman identifies a specie� (for example, beetle), the e n tomologist iden tifies something like 290, 000 species , but also that the lexical system of a natu ral language and scientific taxonomies overlap i n a very 'fuzzy' way. We c a l l tree both an elm a n d a pine tree , while a natu ralist would say that the former is an 'angiosperm' and that the latte r is not. There is n o taxonomic equivalent of tree a n d no ordinary language equ ivalent of angiosperm .
However, Hjelmslev's proposal can allow one to conceive of a sort of taxonomic tree as in Figure 2 . 3 , designed to defi ne withou t ambiguity and w i th the maxi m u m economy a series of word s , namely, dog, wolf, fox, cat, tiger, lynx, bachelor (as a seal), horse, ox, buffalo, sheep, mouflon, elephant and echidna. In such a linguistic (and natural) u n iverse, one is not supposed to distinguish a horse from an ass or an elephant from a rhinoceros, and thi s explains why only certain lower disj u nctions are

Dictionary vs. E ncyclopedia

[53]

called for. In this sense, the tree of Figure 2 . 3 overlaps only partially a cu rre n t scientific taxonomy.
The tree of Figu re 2 . 3 provides the picture of a very res tricted u ni­ verse made up of natural kinds (of which the words in italic in the lower row p rovide names ) . We are obliged to consider this u n iverse as a re­ stricted one for the sake of our experiment: this u niverse is scarcely similar to the one of our actual experience , but when speaking of dic­ tionaries one must conceive not only of very artificial languages but also of very artificial worlds. For instance , this u niverse takes i n to account neithe r 'artificial' kinds (such as a house or a chair) nor pred icates, nor actions, nor social roles (such as 'king' , 'bachelor' , 'pilot' ) . I t has been remarked how it is difficu l t to accou n t for all these problems at the same time (see Schwartz 1 977 : 3 7 - 4 1 ). Aristotle (and Porphyry) dealt with natural kinds in the tree of s ubstances, admitting that all the other phenomena should have been dealt with i n one of the possible trees for the other nine categories (see 2 . 2 . I). As for artificial kinds, Aristotle was convinced that one can deal with them as if they were substances, b u t accord i n g t o some a n alogical p roce d u res (see Metaphysics, 1 04 3 b2 1 , 1 070a - b).
I t is not necessary to decide whether the li nguis tic terms i n each node
of the tree names classes included within large r classes or properties in
some way contained or postulated by the terms naming the natural kinds listed i n italic i n the lowest row . One can say that a ny name of a s u bclass postulates its class or that every name of natural kinds postulates a hierarc h ical series of properties . In lexicographical re p resentations of a system of hypo/hyperonyms, i t is usual to assu me that, if the meaning of a word is incl uded within the meaning of another, then "each 'included' meaning has all the features of the 'includi ng' meaning . . . plus at least one more featu re which serves to dis tinguish the more res tricted area" (Nida 1 975 : 1 6).
I n a n y case, t h e whole system of Figu re 2 . 3 is a finite one, which
accou n ts also for synonymy, paraphrase, and semantic difef rence and which perm i ts the production of definitions. Only a cat is a « felis catus , felis,
fetid, fi ssiped, carnivorous placental animal » , a n d , if something does not
have all these properties in conjunction , then i t cannot be a cat.
This tree accou n ts for all the phe nome na that a good dictionary is s u pposed to explain. I t is a ve ry flexible tool . Suppose one has to explain also the mea n i ng of /halibut/; it will be sufficient to inse rt the disj u nc­ tion 'fish/mammal' under the node 'an imal' , and the tree would equally taper toward an ultimate node. With fu rther complications one could also distinguish /bachelor/ as a seal from /bachelor/ as a h u man being. The tree would always result i n being fi nite.
The tree does not offer the possibility of distinguishing between male

[54]

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILGISOPHY OF LANGUAGE

and female, adult and young. It is a pity; we shall see apropos of the Porphyrian Tree (in 2. 1 . 3 ) how e m barrassing these kinds of ' accide n ts' are . B u t before coming to grips with these formidable questions , we have to raise a more u rgen t criticism .

2.1.3. The interpretation of the markers The tree explains without a mbiguity that a cat is nothing else but a 'felis catus' . But i n Latin (even though at two differe n t historical s tages of this language) both /felis/ and lcatus/ (or cattus) are synonymous with the E nglish word /cat/. Thus the definiens and the definiendum are certainly interchangeable, but only because they are absolu tely and redundantly synonymous : a cat is a cat is a cat is a cat. If one asks what a felis catus is, one knows that it is a felis, which is not e nough to disti nguish a cat from a tiger.
However, when a zoologist says that what we call cat is a 'Felis catus' he is not merely playing on words. He uses Felis as the name of a genus and catus as the name of a differe n ti a , but by these short-hand ex­ p ressions he i n tends to signify other biological p roperties. To be a catus means to have the properties p h p 2 • • • P n . and to be a Felis means to have the properties p h p2, • • • p ,. (and so on for the upper nodes) .
The taxonomy of the zoologist does not intend to be a way to analyze the meaning of the word /cat/; it rep resents a mere classification of natu­ ral kinds, accidentally labeled with certain names (changing from natural language to natural l anguage ) . The zoologist as such is strongly i n ter­ ested i n defining the actual p rope rties of the species he classifies , yet these properties are simply contained or meant by the terms he uses as taxonomic labels .
If a zoologist is told that gorillas grow in Ireland, he can react in two ways . E i ther he unders tands the sente nce in the sense that some gorillas are born i n I reland , and in this case he is eager to concede that s imilar eve nts happen in zoological gardens, or he takes the sentence as convey­ ing an ' e ternal' proposition (all the animals belongin g to this s pecies grow in Irel a n d ) , and then he would say that the proposition is analytically false because it challenges some information that belongs to his definition of gorillas . Likewise he would not discuss the s tatement this sheep has three feet, since he knows that there can be handicapped sheep, but he wou ld challenge the s tate ment sheep are notfour-footed be­ cause i n his defi nition of a sheep there is a marker (probably 'ungulata' ) that must be interpreted i n terms of four-footedness. Perhaps the zoologist would not say that sheep are four-footed necessarily or analytically, but he would say that the property of being fou r-footed belongs to sheep in some � trong sense of /belongi ng/.
Zoologists know that their classificatory markers a re interpretable and

that they are not metalinguistic constructs b u t words of their specific o bj ect-language . Zoologically speaking, ' m a m mal' is not only a metalin­ gu is tic construct that guarantees the semantic anomaly of s uch assertions as a stone is a mammal: /mammal/ means more or less << an ani mal which nourishes its young with milk secreted by mammary glands » . Speakers of natu ra l l anguage do the same, obviously: when they say that a land is rich in mi nerals, they do not intend only that that land is rich in nonliv­ ing natural objects , but i n tend many other i n teresting p roperties as wel l . In natural language w e frequently use expressions as a n i m a l , object, and vegetal as many times as we speak of cats and wolves, and maybe more often . This means either that we are using many terms of a metalan­ guage as items of a natural language or that there is a diffe re nce between 'animal' as a semantic marker and /animal/ as a linguistic expressio n . B u t this is indeed a mere wordplay; in fact, when lexicographers or phi­ losophers of l anguage use the seman tic marke r 'animal' they are using a word of their natural language to build u p a metalanguage . One can say that, as soon as a natu ral expression has beco me a metalinguistic te rm , it should not be further interpre ted; such a rigoro us decision is indeed possible and the tree of Figure 2. I proves it, but, once this decision has been made, it is difficult to know not only what a sheep and a mouflon a re but also what /sheep/ and /mo uflon/ mean .
It would be sufficient to say that a dictionary has the sole fu nction of providing a computer with the capability of parsing sentences in ord e r to test whether they are semantically consistent, red undant, or analytically tru e , without exp l a i n i n g the m e a n i ng of their co m po n e n t words to so meone who is not acquainted with any correspondi ng s ta te of the world. Yet eve n the most rigorous theories of a d ictionary compete nce try to escape this fate , and in two ways: from a practical point of view, by matching a re presentation of mean ing with some ins tructions for the in­ d ivid uation of the referents (see Katz 1 979 for the " neoclassical" theory of mea n ing) , and from a theoretical point of view, by defining even the analytic markers. Katz analyzes the lexeme /c hair/ as

(Obj ect) ( P hysical) (Non l iving) (Artifact) (Fu rniture) (Portable) (So me­ thing with legs) (Something with a back) (Something with a seat) (Seat for one)

so mixing up analytical properties and pieces of world knowledge ; b u t at the same time he says that each of the concepts represented by the semantic markers "can itself be broken into componen ts . For example, the concept of an object represented by '(obj ect)' might be analyzed as an organization of parts that are spatio-temporally contiguous which form a stable whole having an orientation in space" ( 1 972 : 40).
If so, the tree of Figu re 2 . 3 should host other markers such as 'organ-

Dictionary vs . E ncyclopedia

[57]

ization' , 'part' , 'orientation' , 'space' , 'contiguous' , and so on. E ve n ad­ mi tting that all these markers can be inserted into a bidimensional tree (and wi thou t asking what will happen when one decides to analyze, along with 'obj ect' , also 'living' or 'furnitu re' , not to men tion all the rest), we are not sure that markers s uc h as 'contiguous' a re of the same nature as 'space' o r 'animal' .
Moreover, to make the markers inte rpre table, usually a theory has to give up on their hierarchy and consider them as an unordered set, that is, i t has to adopt a cross-classificato ry c rite rion (cf. the re marks of Dean Fodor 1 977: 1 53 ) . We have demonstrated that, i f the tree is not hierarchi­ cally organize d , one has no more guarantees of dealing with a fi nite number of markers .
Thus either t h e primitives cannot b e i n te rpre te d , and o n e cannot ex­ plain the meaning of a term , or they can and must be i n te rpre ted , and one cannot limit their number. The latte r is the case of the Porphyrian tree, i n which the notion of difef rentia specijica is posited exactly in order to provide a minimal, but s u fficient, i n te rpretation for every marker. Un­ fortu nately, as we shall see , as soon as the differen tiae a re introduced, a Porphyrian tree loses the properties of a d ic tionary and becomes an en­ cycloped i a .

2.2. Critique of the Porphyrian tree
2.2. 1 . Aristotle on definition
Aristotle says that "definition is of the essence or essen tial nature" (Post.
An. 2 . 90b30). To defi ne a substance means to establis h , among variou s
accidental attributes , the esse ntial ones, particularly that one which causes the substa nce to be as it is - its su bstantial form . The problem is then to " h u n t" for the right attribu tes that must be predicated as ele­ ments in the definition (96a 1 5 ) . Aristotle gives the example of the attri­ butes that can apply to the number 3: an attribute such as 'being' un­ doubtedly applies to 3 , b u t also to other things that are not numbers . On the contrary, 'oddness' applies to every 3 and , eve n though it has a wider application (it also applies to 5), it nevertheless does not extend beyond the ge nus ' n u m be r' . "We must select attribu tes of this ki nd, up to the poin t where , al though each of them has a wider extension that the s u b­ j ect, all together they have not; this will be the essence of the thi ng" (96a35). Aristotle means that, if one defi nes man as a rational , mortal animal, each of these attributes , s i ngly, also applies to other entities (for instance , also horses are animals, dogs are mortals, angels are rational), but, taken as a whole, as a definitional cluster, these attributes apply only to man ( thus dejiniens and definiendum are converti ble or bicondi­ tionally linked: p = q}.

[58]

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

However, a definition is not a d e monstration : to show the essence of a thing is not the same as to prove a proposi tion about it; a definition reveals what an object is while a demonstration proves that something can be said of a given subj ect (91 a 1 ) . I n a definition we are ass u m i ng what we are req uired to prove in a demonstration (91 a35), and those who d efi ne do not prove that something exists (92b2o). A definition explains the meaning of the name (93b30).
I n his atte m p t to find out a right method for i nferrin g satisfactory defi n i tions, Aristotle develops the theory of predicables, that i s , the modes in which the categories can be applied to a subj ect. I n Topics ( I . I O i b i 7 - 24) Aristotle lists only four p redicables, nam ely , ge nus, p roperty (proprium ) , defi nition, and accident. Since Porphyry will defi­ n i tely list five predicables (genus , species, differe n tia, property, and ac­ cident), this d iscrepancy has aroused many discussions . There was a serious reason why Aristotle did not insert the differen tia among predic­ ables : the differentia "being generic in character, i t should be ranged with the genus" (Topics I. I O i b20), and to define consists in putting the s u bject into its genus and then adding the differe n tiae (Topics 6. 1 39a30) . Thus one can say that, in a way, the differe n tia is automatically (via ge nus and defi nition) i nserted i n to the list. As far as the s pecies i s con­ cerned , Aristotle does not mention i t because the species cannot be predicated of anything, being the ultimate subject of any p redication . Since , however, the s pecies i s expressed by the definition , this probably explains why Porphyry i n his lists replaces s pecies with definition.

2.2.:z. The Porphyrian tree In a long discussion in Posterior Analytics ( 2 . 1 2 . 96b25 - 97b 1 5 ) , Aris totle outlines a series of rules for d eveloping a righ t d ivision from the most u niversal ge nera to the infimae species, by isol ating at every s tep the right differe ntiae .
This is the method carried out by Porphyry in his Isagoge. The fact that Porphyry develops a theory of division in commenting upon Aristo­ tle's Categories (where the problem of differentia and genus is j ust men­ tioned) is a m atter that requires serious d iscussion (see Moody 1 935) but is not relevant for the purposes of the present analysis. We can also disregard the discussion o n the nature of u n iversals , opened by the Isagoge though the commentary of Boethius . Porphyry says that he in­ ten d s to "put aside the investigation of certain p rofound questions," namely, whether genera or species exist in the mselves or reside in mere concepts alone. As a m atter of fact, he is the first to translate Aristotle's suggestion o n definition under the form of a tree, and it is difficult to avoid the s uspicion that he is portraying ( rather iconically) a Neoplatonic chain of beings. B u t we can disregard the metaphysics underlying the Porphyrian tree, since we are i nterested in the fact that this tree, i nde-

Dictionary vs. E ncyclopedia

[59]

pendent of its a lleged me taphysical grounds and conceived as a rep re­ sentation of mere logical relationships , has influenced all subsequent dis­ cussions on the method of d efinition. We are not in tere s te d in the metaphysical persl?ective according to which Porphyry ou tlines a unique tree of substances , and i t is doubtful whether Aristotle thought in this way or was more flexibly eager to i m agine different and differently s truc­ tured trees according to the definitory proble m he had to solve . Aristotle deals cautiously with this method of division and , if he seems to ap­ preciate i t in the Posterior Anolytics, he see m s to be more skeptical in Ports ofAnimals (6426bff) . Nevertheless, Porphyry d esigned a unique tree for substances , and i t is from this model that every subsequent idea of a d ictionary-like rep resentation s te m s .
Porphyry lists five predicables : genus, species , diffe rentia, property, and accident. The five predicables establish the modes of definition for all the te n categories (substance plus nine accidents). It is therefore pos­ sible to think of ten Porphyrian trees : one for substance s , which allows , for instance, the definition of man as a rational mortal animal, and one for each of the other nine categories ; for instance , a tree of qualities will allow the d efinition of purple as a species of the genus ' red' . Aristotle said that even accidents a re susceptible to definition, even though an accident can be said to have an essence only in reference to substances (Metaphysics 8 . 1 028a 1 0 - I OJ i a i O) . There are , thus , ten possible trees , but there is n o t a tree of t h e ten trees, because t h e B e i n g is not a summum genus.
Undou btedly, the substance-tree proposed by Porphyry aims at being considered a finite set of genera and species (we will see i n which sense this assumption is unte nable); it is not said whether the other nine pos­ sible trees are to be fi nite or not, and Porphyry is rather elusive on this subj ect.
The definition Porphyry gives of genus is a purelyformal one: a genus is that to which the s pecies is subordinate. Likewise the species is what is s ubord inate to a genus. Thus ge nus and species are relative to each other, that is, m u tually definable. Any genus posited on a given node of the tree e ncompasses its dependent species , but each species becomes at i ts tu rn the genus of another underlying species, and so on, until the last row of the tree, where the species speciolissimoe or second substances are locate d . At the upper node of the tree there is the genus generolissimus (represented by the name of the category), and this genus cannot be the species of something else.
Thus every species postulates its upper ge nus, while the opposite does not hold . A genus can be 'predicated of ' its specie s , while species 'belong to' their genus. However, a Porphyrian tree cannot be composed only of genera and species ; o therwise , i t would assume the format repre­ sented in Figure 2 . 4 . ( Incidentally, in the Neoplatonic tradition , gods

are listed among bodies and animals because they are i n termediate natu­ ral forces , not to be iden tified with the inaccessible and i m mate rial One.

,

I n order to u nders tand be tte r the nature of difef rentia, one must care­

fully disti ngu ish between accident, difef rentia, and proprium. This is a

crucial point, since accide n ts are not required to produce a definition,
and the 'prope rty' (proprium ) has a curious status : it belongs to the spe­

cies , but it is not requ ired to build up the definition. There are diffe re n t

types of p ropria: (a) occurring in one species , although n o t in every

member of it (as the capability of heal i ng in men); (b) occurring i n the

whole species, but not i n a si ngle species only (as being two-foote d ) ; (c)

occurring in the whole species, and only in a single one, but only at

some time (as being grey in old age); (d) occurring in a whole species,

only in a single one, and at every time (as the capacity of laughing in

man). This last case is the one most frequently q uoted in cl assical litera­

tu re and has an interesting feature : it is biconditionally equ ivalent with

its subject (only men are laughing beings, and vice versa). The nature of

propriu m remains mysterious, both in Aristotle and in Porphyry , since it

looks like something midway betwe e n an essential and analytic prope rty

and an encyclopedic and synthetic one.

Let us come back to the differentia. Diffe re n tiae can be separable from

[61 ]

the s ubj ect (as t o be hot, moving, ill), a n d i n this sense they are mere accidents . But they can also be inseparable: some of the m are inseparable but still accid e n tal, as to be hook-nose d , but there are differentiae that belong to the s u bject per se, or essentially, as being rational, mortal, and capable of knowledge . These are the specific difef rentiae which are added to the genus i n order to form the definition of the species .
Differentiae ca n be both divisive and constitutive. For insta nce , the ge nus ' Living Bei ngs' is potentially d ivisible into the differe n tiae 'sensi­ tive/insensitive' (endowed or not with sensitivi ty) , but the differen tia 'sensitive' can be composed with the genus 'living being' to constitute the genus 'animal' . The genus 'ani mal' is divisible into ' rational/ irra­ tional' , but the difference ' rational' is constitu tive (along with the ge nus it divides) of the species 'animal rational ani mal' . Thus the differentiae divide a genus ( the genus potentially contains these opposites) and are selected to constitute in fac t a lowe r ge nus.
The /sagoge only sugges ts verbally the idea of the tree, b u t the medieval trad ition has definitely built it u p , as in Figu re 2 . 5 . In the tree of Figure 2 . 5 , the dotted lines marks the divisive diffe rentiae, while the continuous lines mark the same diffe re n tiae insofar as they are consid­ e red constitutive.

:z.:z.J. A tree which is not a tree
It see ms that the tree of Figure 2 . 5 does s how the difference between man and God , but not the one between man and horse. As a matte r of fact, all the instances of a Porphyrian tree, fol lowing a common standard , aim a t showing how m a n can b e defined and are therefore incomplete . In order t o isolate the essence of horses , t h e diagram should display a differe nt series of disj unctions on its righ t side so as to isolate (along with a rational animal) an irrational (and mortal) one. Even in this case, how­ eve r, a horse could not be distinguished fro m a dog; one should there­ fore postulate some complication of the right side of the tree so as to insert i n to the diagra m many more disjunction s . Aristotle would h ave had serious problems in doing so: in Parts of Animals he c riticizes the method of d ivision a n d , so to speak, p rovides many possible small trees according to the specific problem he has to solve .
However, the tree of Figure 2 . 5 encourages a stro nger o bjection. What distinguishes God fro m man is the diffe re nce mortal/i m mortal ; but horse and man are both mortal and are distinguished by the difference ' ration­ al/irra tional' . Therefore one has to choose either of the following alter­ natives : (a) the differentia 'mortal/i m mortal' is not divisive of the genus 'rational animal' but, rather, of the genus 'animal' (but in this first case it woul d be impossible to tel l the d ifference between man and God); (b) the differentia 'mortal/immortal' occurs twice , one time under 'rational animal' and one time under 'irrational animal' .

Porphyry would n o t have discouraged this second d ecisio n , since he says that the differe n tia " is often observed in many species, as fou r­ footed i n many animals which diffe r in species" ( 1 8. 20). This is a very i mportant re mark. Also, Aristotle says that, when two or more genera are subordinate to a n upper genus (as it happens to man a n d horse insofar as they are both a n i mals), nothing preven ts the m from having the same differentiae (Cat. , I b . I sf;f Topics, 4. 1 64b. I O).
I n Posterior Analytics ( 2 . 90bff) Aristotle shows how i t is possible to ar­ rive at an u n ambiguous definition of the n u m be r J . Keeping in mind that for Greeks I was not a number (but rathe r the source and the mea­ sure of any successive number), the nu mber 3 can be defined as that odd number which is prime i n both senses of being neither measurable by number nor com posed of n u m bers . This definition is (biconditionally) equivalent with the expression three. But it is i n teresting to represent ( F igure 2 . 6) how Aristotle reaches this conclusion by a careful work of division.
This sort of division displays two inte resting consequences: (a) the p roperties registered in italic are not exclusive of a given node but can occur under more nodes ; and (b) a given species ( 2 , 3 , 9) can be defi ned by the conj u nction of more of the above p roperties. I n fact, these p rop­ e rties are differe n tiae. Thus Aristotle shows by a clear example, not o nly

that many diffe re ntiae can be attributed to the same species, but also that the same couple of difef rentiae can occur under diverse genera. Moreover, he shows that, once a given diffe re nce has served to define unam bigu­ ously a given species , one is not obliged to take into accoun t all the other s u bj ects or which it is predicable : in other words, o nce one or more differen tiae have se rved to define without a m biguities the numbe r 3 , it is irrelevant that they can also serve to define the number 2 . ( For a clear statement in this sense, see Post. An . 2 . 1 3 . 97a1 5 - 25 . )
B u t a t this point we can try a furthe r ste p . Once it has been said that, given s u bordinate ge nera , nothing prevents them from having the same differe n tiae, and since the tree of substances is wholly made of genera that are a l l su bordinate to the u ppe rmost one , it is hard to tell how many times the same cou ple of differe ntiae can occur. In Topics ( I . 15. 1 06l!b} Aristotle says that we can call both a sound and a material substance 'sharp' . It is true that 'sharp' does not mean the same differe n tia in both cases , since i n the forme r case it is opposed to 'flat' and in the latter case to 'd ull' ( thus the same name is used equ ivocally for two diverse d iffer­ entiae ) . However, the same opposition 'white/black' occurs when one s peaks either of colors or of sou nds. Aristotle is convinced that this equivocality is a merely lexical one, since the same couple of contraries is refe rred to two differe n t cases of sense-percep tion (sight and hearing) . However, this equ ivocality is similar to the nonunivocal use of to be for the propositions men are animals ( which is a matter of substantial bei ng) and these men are white (which is a m atter of accident): a case i n which
. Aristotle speaks of " being used in various senses but with reference to
one central idea" (7Tpor;; ev: Metaphysics 4 · wo 3 a 3 o) This reference to a central idea will be translated (by medieval philosophers) in terms of anal­ ogy, of proportion, not in terms ofmere equivocality.
In Topics I . 1 5 . 1 07b30) Aris totle will also say that the couple 'white/

black' when refe rred to a body is a species of color, whereas when refe rred to a sound it is a difef rentia (for one note diffe rs from the other in being more o r less clear or white). The whole matte r is ve ry complex, but how to avoid the suspicion that the entire un iverse of differe n tiae is polluted by metaphorical a mbiguities ( be they due to mere equivocal i ty or to analogy)? Is ' two-footed' as referred to man the same as ' two-footed' as referred to a bird ? Is 'rational' as applied to man the same as 'rational' as applied to God?

2.24 The tree is entirely made up with differentiae
Many medieval com mentators on the Isagoge seem to e ncourage our suspicions. Boethius (In /sagogen, C. S. E . L. 256. 1 0 - 1 2 , 266. 1 3 - 1 5 ) writes that ' mortal' c a n b e a differentia for 'irrational a n i mal' a n d that the species 'horse' is consti tuted by the d iffere n tia ' i rrational and mortal' . He also suggests that 'im mortal' can be a di ffere n ti a for celestial bodies which are ina nimate and i mmortal: "In this case the differentia immortal is shared between species that d i ffe r not only i n the i r proximate genus but also i n all their ge nera up to the subaltern genus second from the top of the tree" (Stump 1 978: 257).
According to Stump, the suspicion aroused by Boethius is "su rprising" and "d isconcerting" ; in fact, it is only reaso nable. Aristotle and Porphyry say that a differe n tia is greater (e ncom passes more) than i ts subject, and this could not be if only men were mortal and only gods were i m mortals. In order to have such a result 'mortal/immortal' must occur under more than a ge nus, and so on for the other d i ffere n tiae . Otherwise it would be inco m p rehensible why (accord i ng to Topics 4· 1 44a25) the species entails the d i fference , but the d i ffere nce does not e n tail the species : ' mortal' has a wider extension than 'animal rational and mortal' .
Abelard , in his Editio super Porphyrium ( 1 57v . 1 5 ) , suggests that a given differe n tia is predicated of more and d i ffere n t species: "falsu m est quod omnis diffe re n tia sequens pon i t superiores , quia ubi sunt permixtae d i f­ ferentiae, falli t." Th us, given that (a) the same d ifferentia can encom­ pass more s pecies , (b) the same couple of d i ffere n tiae can occu r under more than one ge nus, (c) d i ffere n t couples of differe ntiae can be repre­ sented under m a ny genera by using the same names (equ ivocally or analogically), and (d) i t is an open question how high in the tree the common genus can be in respect to w h ich many subordinate genera can host the same d i fferen tiae, then one is entitled to reformu late the Por­ phyrian tree as in Figure 2 . 7 .
The tree o f Figure 2 . 7 displays many inte res ting characteristics : ( a ) it provides the represen tation of a possible world in which many new and still u nknown natural kinds can be discovered and defined ( for instance, incorporeal , animate , and irrational su bs tances); (b) i t s hows that so-

called genera and s pecies are names by which one labels only clusters of diffe re n tiae; (c) according to this tree, one cannot p redict that if mortal the n rational, or if irrational then corpo real , and so o n ; (d) as a conse­ quence of (c) it can be freely reo rganized accord i n g to alternative hie rar­ chies.
As for the characteristic (a), we have seen what Boethius said apropos of celestial bodies . As for the characteris tic ( b ) , it must be clear that this tree is composed only ofdifef rentiae. Genera and s pecies are only the names that we assign to the nodes represen ted by d isj unction s of diffe rentiae. Boethius, Abelard , and other med ieval scholars knew this so well that they continually complain about the penuria nominum, that is, about the fact that we do not have enough lexical items to name the nodes of the tree rep rese n ted by differentiae added to d i fferentiae of u pper diffe r­ entiae.
Consider the case of the constitutive node obtained by adding the differentia 'rational' to the ge nus 'animal' : the trad i tional tree labels this node with the expression rational animal, which is blatantly red undant and only repeats the name of the upper genus and of the differentia constitu tive of the unnamed species. This laziness in providing names for species is rather i nconceivable . The medieval i magination co uld have coined some new term . But it is a merely empirical circumsta nce that somebody fou n d the name /an i mal/ for labeli n g the node com posed by adding the d i fference 'sensitive' to /living being/ , which is in turn the mere name of the composition 'animate + corporeal' . The names of genera are insufficient because they are mere shorthand: a genus is no more than a cluster of d i ffere n tiae . Genera and species are l i nguistic

[66]

SEMIOTICS AND THE P HILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

ghosts tha't cove r the real nature of the tree and of the u n iverse it repre­ sents: a world of pure differentiae .

Thus, if Aristotle did not list the s pecies among the pred icables (since the s pecies is a sum of genus and differentia), for the same reason also

genera could be eliminate d , since they, too , a re mere s u m s of upper genera and other d i fferentiae.
As for the characteristic (c), since differentiae do not contain each

other, the classical Porphyrian tree (as u nveiled in i ts true nature in Figure 2 . 7) is no longer a hierarchical and ordered structure. It does not

provide any guara n tee of being fin i te .

As for the .characteristic ( d ) , the tree c a n b e continually reelaborated

and rearrange d . Si nce ' mortal' does not contain ( necessarily) ' rational' ,

why not put ' mortal' upon ' rational' ? Boethius (De divisione 6, 7) says clearly that this kind of optional division is possible for accidents. We can

say that all white are either hard (pearl) or liquid ( m ilk). But we can at the same ti me say that, given the genus of hard things , some of them are

white ( pearl) and some of them are black (let us say, ebony); or that, given the genus of liquid things , some are white ( milk) and some are

black (let us say, ink). Therefore Boethius s uggests that (at least for accidents} m a ny trees can be arranged playing upon the same entities , as

Boethius, however, says something more (De divisione 37), namely, that the same freedom of choice holds as far as every genus is concerned. We can divide n u mbers between p ri me and not prime as well as betwee n even and odd. We can divide triangles either accord i n g to their sides or according to their a ngles . " F i t autem generis eiusdem d ivisio multiplici­ ter . . . generis u n ius fi t multiplex divisio . . . genus una quodammodo multaru m specierum similitudo, est . . . atque ideo collectivum plurimarum specieru m genus est."
The same is said by Abelard (Editio super Porphyrium I 6ov . I2): "plur­ aliter ideo dicit genera , quia animal dividitu r per rationale animal e t ir­ rationale; et rationale per mortale et im mortale dividi tur; et mortale per rationale et i rrationale dividi tur" (that is to say, as in Figure 2 . 9) . In a tree c o m posed w i th p u re d iffere nces , these d i ffe re nces can be re­ arranged according to the description under which a given subject is considered.

2.2.5 . Differentiae a s accidents and signs Differen tiae e nj oy s uch a si ngular s tatus because they are accidents , and accidents are i nfi nite , or at least indefinite , i n n umber.
Differentiae are qualities, and i t is not by chance that, whereas genera and species a re expressed by common nouns, diffe re n tiae are expressed by adjectives . They belong to a tree different from the one of s u b­ stances. According to Aristotle, their n u m ber cannot be known a priori (Metaphysics 8 . 2 . 6. 1 042b2 - 1 043a). I t is true that he says this of nones­ sential differentiae , but who really knows which differen tiae are s tric tly essential or specific? Aristotle plays upon a few exam ples (such as ra­ tional and morta l , followed by the whole medieval tradition), but when he speaks of other natural kinds, such as animals, and of artificial ob­ j ects, he is more vague, so as to make his readers suspect that he could have never thought of a finite Porphyrian tree.
However, the notion of specific differen tia conceals an oxymoron: a s pecific differe n tia is an essential accident. Is i t possible to solve such a philosophical puzzle? The most striking answer to this ques tion is given by Aquinas . In De Ente et Essentia Aquinas asserts that the d i ffere n ti a s pecifica corresponds t o t h e substantial form ( the d i fference corresponds to the form , a n d the genus to the m atter, and together they make up the essence of the substance of which they provide the defi n i tion). At this point i t would appear rather whimsical to iden tify an accident (a qual i ty) with a substa n tial form , but Aqu inas excogitates a brilliant solution: "in rebus sensibilibus etsi ipsae d i ffere n tiae essentiales nobis ignotae sunt: unde significantur per d i fferentiae accidentales q uae ex essentiali bus oriuntur, sicut causa significatur per s u u m effectu m , sicut bipes ponit d i fferen tia hominis" (De Ente 6). Essential differences cannot be known directly by us; we know (we i nfer! ) the m by semiotic means, through the effects (accidents) they produce, and these accidents are the sign of their unknowable cause.
T h i s i d e a i s re p e a te d , f o r i n s ta n c e , in t h e Summa Theologiae
( 1 . 29. 2 - 3 ; or 1 . 77 . 1 - 7). Thus we d iscover that differe n tiae such as rational are not the actual su bstantial form that constitu tes the species as such: Aquinas makes clear that the ratio as potentia animae appears out­ side verbo et facto, through external actions (and actions are not sub­ s tances , but accidents); men are tol d to be rational because they man-

ifest their rational potency through their activity of knowing, an activity that they perform by internal thought and exte rnal discourse ( I . 79. 8/f) . I n a decisive text (Contra Gentiles 3 . 46), Aqui nas says that human beings d o not know what they are (quid est) ; they know quod est ( that they are so), insofar as they perceive themselves as performing a rational activity. What in reality our spiritual potencies are , we know "ex ipsorum acru u m qualitate ," through the quality of t h e acts of which they are the pote n­ cies.
Thus, ' rational' is a n accident, and so we are all the differe n tiae in which the traditional Porphyrian tree d issolves itself.
The tree of ge nera and species, the tree of substances , blows up i n a dust of differe n tiae, in a turmoil of infinite accidents, in a nonhierarchi­ cal network of qualia. The dictionary is dissolved into a pote n tially unor­ d e red a n d u n res tricted gal axy of pieces of world knowledge . The dictionary thus becomes an e ncyclopedia, because it was in fact a dis­ guised encyclopedia.

2.3. Encyclopedias
2.3. 1 . Some attempts : registering contexts and topics If a dictionary is a disguised e ncyclopedia, then the o n ly possible rep re­ sentation of the conte n t of a given lexical ite m cannot be p rovided ex­ cept in terms of an encycloped ia. If the so-called universals , or metatheore tical co nstructs , that work a s marke rs within a dictionary-like representation a re mere li nguis tic labels that cover more synthetic prop­ e rties, an encyclopedia-like represen tation assumes that the representa­
tion of the con te n t takes place only by means of interpretants, in a p rocess of unlimited se miosis . These inte rpretants being in the i r turn inte rpre t­ able, the re is no bid imensional tree able to represent the global semantic competence of a given culture . Such a global representation is only a semiotic postulate, a regulative idea, and takes the format of a mul­ tidimensional n e twork that has been described as the Model Q ( Eco 1976, 2. 1 2).
Local representations of the Model Q are implemen ted eve ry ti me a given text requires a background encyclopedic knowledge in order to be inte rpre te d . These local representations of the e ncyclopedic knowledge assu me the form of a set of ins tructions for the p roper textual insertion of the terms of a language into a series of con texts (as classes of co-texts) and for the correct disambiguation of the same te rms when met within a give n co- text . An e n cyclopedic version of c o m pon e n tial s e m a ntics should then appear as an Instruktionssemantik which is text-theore tically orie nted (see, for i nstance , Sch midt 1 976) .

analysis in an encyclopedic format, where the spectrum of the sememe (corresponding to the content of .a given expression) was analyzed in terms of contextual and circumstantial selections. I have also maintained that this k i n d of re p resentation s h o u l d hol d not only _for so-called categorematic terms but also for the syncategore matic ones , and I have provided examples of an instruction-like or a text-oriented analysis of not only verbal expressions but also i ndexical signs, as a pointing finger.
In The Role of the Reader I have insisted o n the fact that a sememe is a virtual or potential text and that a text is the expansion of one or more seme mes . The encyclopedic represen tation of the sememe has been reinforced with the reference to frames, scripts , and other instructions concerning coded circumsta ntial and con textual occurre nces . As a conse­ quence, i t is clear that an encyclopedic representation , insofar as i t is text-oriented , must take i n to acco unt this kind of so-called pragmatic factor as wel l . In an encyclopedic re presen tation, semantics must trans­ late into its own terms most of the phenomena s tudied by pragmatics . There a re many contextual operators which work exclusively in relation with a give n co-text, but the i r co-textual fate must be established , fore­ seen, and predicted by coded contextual selections.
Take a co-textual operator such as the Italian syncategorematic ex­
= pression linvece/, basically translatable as /instead/. When syntagmati­
cally linked with /di/ (invece di instead of) it is basically a sentence operator. Without preposi tion , /invecel is an adverb and wo rks as a tex­ tual operator, and can be translated as /on the contrary/ or /on the other hand/. As such i t seem s to express some opposition, but i t is dou btful what i t is opposed to . Take the following expressions:

( I ) Mary ama le mele . john invece le odia. (Mary loves apples . john on the other hand hates them. )
(2) Mary ama le mele . lnvece odia le banane . ( M a ry loves apples . On the other hand she hates bananas . )
( 3 ) M a ry ama l e mele . Invece john adora l e banane . ( M a ry loves apples . john on the other hand is fond of bananas . )
(4) Mary sta suonando i l violoncello. john i nvece sta m angiando banane . ( M a ry is p l a y i n g h e r ' c e l l o . j o h n o n the o t h e r h a n d is e a t i n g bananas . )
We realize that i n ( I ) linvece/ (on the other hand) marks a n al ternative to the s u bj ect and her actio n ; in (2) it marks an a l te rnative to the action and to the obj ect; in ( 3 ) i t marks an al ternative to the subject and the object; in (4) everything seems to be challenged .
Now let us try to insert these expressions i n to a more comprehensive co-text; let us look at them as the appropriate answers to the following questions:

[70]

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

( I a) Do Mary and John love apples? (2a) What kind of frui t does Mary love? (3a) What kind of frui t does John love ? (4a) What the hell are those kids doing? They were s up posed to have
their music lesson!

I t has repeatedly been asserted (see, for instance , van Dij k 1 977) that a textual topic can be detected by formulating the i mplicit question dominating a given text or portion of a text. That is the case . The fou r questions listed a bove are establishing fou r d iffere n t textual topics, namely:

( I b) People who love apples. (2b) Fruit Mary loves. (3b) Fruit John loves. (4b) Music lesson.

At this point i t is intu itively clear that /invecel (on the other hand) in ( I) is opposed to ( l b) , in (2) is opposed to (2b), and so on. This means that our e ncyclopedic competence has s to red a semantic analysis of /invecel where , after a general semantic marker of alternative , a contex­ tual selection is recorded, such as " i n the .cases in wh ich the textual topic is x, the expression under consideration marks an opposition to X" (Figure 2. 1 0) .

2.J.2. Some attempts : registering frames and scripts Nevertheless , there are cases in which such notions as contextual selec­ tions are not enough to establish the possible textual insertion of given lexemes. Take an expression s uch as the following:
(5) John was sleeping when he was suddenly awakened . Somebody was tearing up the pillow.

I imagine that a computer fed with dictionary-like i nformation would be able to understand what /to sleep/ and /pillow/ mea n , but would be unable to establish what the relation is between John and the p illow (and which pillow ? ) . Current research i n Artificial Intellige nce has elabo ra ted the notion of frame ( M i nsky 1 974; Winsto n 1 977; Schank 1 975 , 1 98 1 ;

Dictionary vs. E ncycloped ia

[7 1 ]

van Dij k 1 977) : t h e addressee ( b e it a computer or a hu man being) i s endowed with an enlarged encyclopedic competence which encompasses also a set of frames , or scripts, among which - for instance - are the frames 'sleeping' and 'bedroom' . By resorting to this s torage of compe­ tence , the addressee knows that h u ma n beings usually sleep i n bed­ rooms and that bed rooms are fu rnished with bed s , beds with pillows, and so on. By amalgamation of two or more fra m e s , the addressee realizes that the pillow just mentioned can only be the one John was res ting his head o n .
To what exte n t c a n o n e assume t h a t t h e frames , too, are elements o f an encyclopedia-like componential analysis (an extre mely rich o n e in­ deed)? Do they belong to a sort of additional competence ( that which is called overcoding in Eco 1 976)? Probably the very notion of the e ncyclo­ pedia has to be revised and reorga nized according to different rates of social accessibility or of textual necessity. For instance , when reading John was sleeping and was dreaming of . . . , one does not need to have recourse to the frame ' bedroom' (eve n though one shares this piece of knowled ge), and only the co-text leads one to blow up and to narcotize given sememes or frames (see Eco 1 979) .
The n otio n of fra m e ( be fo re b e i n g postu l a ted by the e m p i rical engineering of Artificial I n telligence scien tists) was already indirectly advocated by Peirce . Take , for instance , his exa mple of a possible defi­ nition of lithiu m . According to a general dictionary ( Webster's New Col­ legiate) , lithiu m is "a soft silver-white element of the alkali metal group that is the lightest metal known and that is used esp. in nuclear reactions and metallurgy " ( I h a ve s t re s s e d t h e m o s t e v i d e n t e l e m e n ts o f encyclopedic information).
According to a scientific handbook, lith i u m is defi nable as that ele­ ment which has an atomic number 3, atomic weight 6. 393 , fusion point 1 08 . 5 degrees centigrade, boiling point 1 3 30 degrees centigrade , density 0 . 5 3 . This second definition, even though expressed in tech nical j argon , looks more similar t o t h e following definition given b y Peirce t h a n it does to the one given by Webster:

If you look i n to a textbook of chemis try for a definition of lithium you may be told that i t is that element whose atomic weight is 7 very nearly. But if
the author has a more logical m i nd he will tell you that i f you search a mong minerals that are vitreous, translucent, gray or white , very hard , brittle , and insoluble for one which imparts a crimson ti nge to an unlu minous flame , this mineral being tri turated with l i m e or witherite rats-bane, and then fused, can be partly dissolved in muriatic acid; and if this solution be evapo­ rated, and the residue be extracted with sulphuric acid , and duly purified, it can be converted by ordinary methods into a chloride, which being obtained in the solid state, fused and electrolyzed with half a dozen powerful cells,

will yield a globule of a pin kish silvery metal that will float on gasolcne; and
the mate rial of that is a specimen of l i thiu m . The pecu liarity of this
defi ni tion - or ra ther this prece pt that is more servicea ble than a
definition - is that it tells you what the word lithium denotes by prescribing
what you a re to do i n order to gain a perceptual acquainta nce with the object
of the world. (C. P. 2. 330)

This 'opera tional' definition looks more like an informal frame than an

e ncyclopedic description (for descriptions of this kind , see Charniak

1 975 , 1 980) . It satisfies the needs of an Instruktionssemantik. Gathering

together the defin ition of Webster and that of Peirce , one is able to

unders tand why, let us suppose, in a text a certain P ro fessor S m i th

should need lithium for an atomic expe riment and look for l i me or

witherite rats-bane . A textual assertion of this type undou btedly elicits a

lot o f p resu ppositions, but these presuppositions are governed by

preexisting frames.

Therefore , when a text theory aims to establish a "frame for frames" (Petofi 1 976), i t is atte m pting both to discover textual rules and to set up

a more organ ized and comprehensive notion of code as encyclopedic

knowledge .

Schank a n d Abelson ( 1 977) attempt to represent not only the lexical

meaning of a given expression but also all the connected forms of world

knowledge that allow the inte rpreter to draw ( from the utte rance of a

term or of a sentence made up with the analyzed te rms) co-textual infer­

ences . Thus ( th rough the use of ce rtain pri m i tives represen ting funda­

mental human opera tions, s uch as ATRANS , EJECT, INGEST, MOVE , and

so on) Schank represen ts the verb to eat as an item susceptible of being

t t inserted into contexts such as John ate a frog ( Figure 2 . I I ).

An interesting semiotic problem (which has escaped the notice of Ar­ tificial Intelligence theorists up to now) is the question of how to i n ter­ pre t in their turn not only the pri m itives expressed verbally b u t also the visual expressions of the d iagram in Figure 2 . 1 0. In a general sem iotic framework, a l inguistic term can be inte rp re ted by nonlinguistic i n ter­ pre ta n ts , but even these inte rpre tants are sem iotic devices which must be i n turn i n terprete d .

The proj ect for an encyclopedic semantics is still in progress. Up to now we have been witnessing a series of alternative or complemen tary proposals . The structural seman tics of Gre i mas ( 1 966, 1 979) , with i ts notion of acta n t and of classemes or contextual semes, as well as with the idea of 'narra tive programs' , is encyclopedia-oriente d ; the earl y case gram mar of Fillmore ( 1 968), along with the more recent researches of Fillmore ( 1 975 , 1 976a, 1 976b, 1 977, 1 98 1 ) , as well as the proposals by B ie rwisch ( 1 970, 1 97 1 ) , are encyclopedia-oriente d . A new semantics i n terms of encyclopedia and world knowledge (and phenomenological ex­ perience) is evident in the last researches of Lakoff ( 1 980) and Lakoff and Johnson ( 1 980).
Si nce all of these representations concern coded sequences of actions, relationships between agents (actors or abstract actants), they can be re­ traced together to the idea of frame.

:z.J.J. Some attempts : stereotypes and commonsense knowledge
Undoubtedly, any encycloped ia-like semantics m u s t blur the distinctions be tween analytic and synthetic properties, and i n this sense nothing bet­ ter has been said afte r and beyo nd Quine's "Two Dogmas of E mpiri­ cis m" ( 1 95 1 ) . �aturally, nothing prevents one from using analytical marke rs , provided one knows that they are shorthand devices used in order to include other analytic pro perties they entail and to s u m marize all the synthetic marke rs they name ( i n the same way as the names of genera , in a Porphyrian tree, name clusters of accidental properties or differentiae). In this sense, the proposal of Putnam ( 1 975) is more than acceptable :

The normal form of description of the meaning of a word should be a finite
sequence, or 'vector' , whose components should ce rtainly include the fol­ lowing (it migh t be desirable to have othe r types of components as well): ( I ) the syn tactic markers that apply to the word , e . g. , 'noun' ; (2) the seman tic
markers that apply to the word , e . g. , 'animal ' , 'period of time' ; (3) a de­
scription of the addi tional feature of the s tereotype, i f any; (4) a description of the extension. The following conven tion is a part of this proposal: the
components of the vector all represent a hypothesis about the individual
speaker' s compe tence , except the exte11Sion. Thus the normal form description
for 'water' m ight be, in part:

Sy11tactic
markers
mass noun, concrete

Semantic markers
natu ral kind liquid

Stereotype
colorless t ra n s p a re n t tas te less thi rs t­ quenching etc.

Extension
H20
(give or take impurities)

[74]

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

The idea of the s te reotype represents p robably the most fru itful s ug­ ges tion coming from Putna m ' s theory of language : according to our nor­ mal competence it is doub tful whether tigers are 'felidae' or 'felis tigris' or ' me tazoa' , but they are undoubtedly 'yellow' , 'like a big cat' , and 'black striped' .
Sema ntic m arke rs are pseudoanalytic shorthand labels , since there should be a ste reotype also for 'liquid' and perhaps for 'natural' .
As for the extension, P u tnam's p roposal is dependent o n his sharing of Kripke's theory of rigid designation ( K ripke 1 972). It is hard to say whether Pu tnam's idea of rigid designation really corresponds to that of Kripke; Putnam thinks of the something rigidly designated by a linguis­ tic term as an essence that can be defined in scien tific terms . However, such an expression as 'H20' is composed by chemical symbols, which, in turn correspond to linguistic terms such as /hyd rogen/ and /oxygen/, and these should in turn be interpreted in terms of other formulas or che m ical symbols (or expressions of natural language) expressing the prope rties of these elements ( atomic n u m ber, a tomic s tructure , plus many of their functional properties - for instance , that oxygen is the element that permits combustion, and so on)..
As a matter of fact , the ultimate refere n t of a rigid designation ( in­ tended as the possible extension of a given term) can be defined in two ways . If rigid designation is (as Kripke seems to suggest) a process of mentions leading backward to an initial and aboriginal baptismal cere­ mony (and therefore to a pri meval act of ostension accompanied by the u tterance of the name ) , then the chain of mediatory information that guarantees the link with the original christening is made up of an unin­ terrupted series of d i sco u rses, descriptions, s tories told about other stories u p to the initial event; and in this case there is no diffe re nce between rigid designation and the encylcopedia, the sum of all these links representing the encylcopedic competence of a society in its very progress through ti m e .
B u t the process of rigid designation c a n also be described in the terms used by Putnam ( 1 975 : 200) . Suppose , suggests Putnam, that I were standing next to Benjamin F ranklin when he made his experiment on electricity and that Franklin told me that 'electricity' is phenomenon so and so. He would h ave given me an approximately correct definite de­ scription of the phenomenon. Now when I use the term /electricity/ , I refe r to the introducing event, the moment I learned that term , and every­ one of my uses of the name will be causally connected to that event, even though I forgot when I first learned what I know about that name. Now suppose that I teach someone the word by telling him that the term /electrici ty/ names a physical magnitude so and so (listing some proper­ ties of the magnitude) without mentioning the causal link occurring be­ tween my present use of the word and the introd ucing event. The being

Dictionary vs. E ncyclopedia

[75]

of this word in someone' s vocabulary will still be causally connected to the introducing event. E nd of Putnam's example.
Even in this case, what makes my (and someone's) language work is not the introducing event but the encyclopedic set of more or less defi­ nite descriptions I was able to provide (and that Frankli n was able to give me). The i ntroducing eve n t was someth i n g similar to Peirce' s Dynamic Object (intending the Dynamic Obj ect both as electricity as physical magnitude and as my original experience of it). But what per­ m i ts communication between me, Putnam, and someone else is the out­ line, via definite descriptions, of an Immediate Object, which is the encyclopedic representation of /electricity/. I t would be possible that among the inte rpretants of the word /electrici ty/ there be also a photo­ graph of Putnam speaking with Franklin; as a matter of fact, among my own (Eco's) i n terpre tants of /electri c i ty/, there are some i mages of Frankli n performing his experiment. But, since even introducing events can be spoken of through interpre tants (disregarding the fact that even Putnam's memories of his own introducing event, if any, could be viewed as mental interpretants or mental icons) , what remains is only an encyclopedic chain.
Finally, if the introducing event described by Putnam really took place (in the way he describes it in P u tnam 1 975: 200), the only things one can semiotically test are just the printed expressions at page 200 of Putnam 1 975, along with their interpretable content.
There is a fu rther obj ection to the theory of rigid designation (at least such as i t is proposed by Kripke and by many of his interpreters). M aybe we call a hal i b u t halibut because of a first baptismal ceremony, and a halibut will still be a halibut (with an essence of its own , as P u tnam sugges ts) eve n though we change by cou n te ffactual conditionals every possible defi n i te description of it. Let us accep t this view. Now let us suppose that, i n order to avoid future world wars , the United Nations decided to establish a Peace Corps of ISC ( I n ter-Species Clones ) . This corps will be co m posed by half-hu man beings, to be prod uced by clon­ ing, through a genetic hybridation of human punk rockers and speaking chimps trained in ASL. Such clones would guarantee a fai r and u nbiased inte rnational control, because they are independent of any national or ethnic heri tage . The UN Assembly has to speak a lot about this new 'natu ral kind' because the members must reach a final agreement - that is, they have to speak about ISCs before ISCs exist, and just i n order to make the m exist. I t is clear that, if there were any baptismal cere mony, what the UN christe ned as ISC was not an original 'thing' , but the encyclopedic description of such a thing. There was neither original os­ tension, nor causal link; there will be only an established corre­ spondence between an expression and the operational description of i ts content (with the understan d i ng that, i n the future , such an expression ,

[76]

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

along with its content, will be used in order to mention some state of affairs , as yet merely possible).
It is evident that we use lingu istic expressions or other semiotic means to name 'things' first met by our ancestors; but it is also evident that we frequently use li nguistic expressions to describe and to call i n to life 'things' that will exist only after and because of the u tterance of our expressions . I n these cases , at least, we are making recourse more to stereotypes and encyclopedic representations than to rigid designators .
M a n y of P u t n a m ' s sugges tions (for in stance , t h e distinction between s tereotyped knowledge and expert knowled ge) are accep ted by Pe tofi's theory of encyclopedical representation. Let us consider, for instance , the te n ta tive re p re s e n tation ( Fi g u re 2 . 1 2 ) of chlorine p ro posed by Neubauer and Petofi ( 1 980: 367). Chlorine is more interesting than elec­ tricity because we have good reasons to believe that not even Putnam was witnessing i ts baptis mal ceremony when Scheele ch ristened i t i n 1 774. (Incidentally, I suspect that he baptized i t i n German a s Chlor, and this fact shuffles the causal chain. )
One can say that the fact that chlorine is a gas is a p iece of common knowledge as well as the fact that it is a disinfectant. But Petofi's pro­ posal is tentative : the difference between commonsense knowledge and expert knowledge should be traced each ti me according to the specific co-text. What is i m portant is to assume that all the ite m s of information listed ( Figure 2. 1 1 ) are part of a possible l i nguistic competence , i rre­ spective of the difference between d ictionary and encyclopedia. There are novels in which many of the 'industrial' properties of chlorine are more i mportant than the one of being a chem ical element. (Incidentally, Petofi records as commonsense knowledge what Putnam wo uld record as semantic information, since to be an element is an 'analytical' property. )
The advan tage of Petofi's model over Pu tnam ' s is that the former definitely gives up the disti nction between intension and extension. Any item of expert know ledge can be intended as a meaning component that serves to establ ish the extension of the term under certain circumstantial con d i tions: since we are not l iving o n the Twi n E arth (see Pu tnam 1 975 ) , when someone is invited to look in some closet for some chlorine, i t is enough that he looks for a greenish liquid , disagreeable to smell, and his subsequent indexical assertion there is some chlorine can be evalu­ ated i n terms of tru th values even according to Tarskian criteria.
There are many other models for an encycloped ic representation, and , at the present state of the art, it would be embarrassing to decide which one i s the more suitable. Rey-Debove ( 1 97 1 ) speaks, apropos of the work of lexicographers and of their ' natural' defi n i tions, of bricolage; she also remarks that, looking at the existing dictionaries, i t seems that i t is easier to define infrequent expressions such as /i n farct/ than frequent ones such as /to do/.

pedia is the only way to outline a possible format of such a universe and to try tentative devices for describing part of it.

:Z.J.4· Clusters Accord ing to the last representation we have exami ned , it is clear that, when the content of an expression is represented i n the format of e ncy­ clopedia, there is no way to establish - out of any context - a hierarchy
among properties. In Figure 2 . 3 we have refrained from inserting sexual differences into the tree. After the critique of the Porphyrian tree , we are now in the position of unders tand ing the reason for this act of pru­ dence. When d i fferences like the sexual ones are taken as specific d i f­ ferentiae (a decision tha t Porphyry would not have encouraged ) , they can occur in many nodes of the tree, so compromising once aga i n i ts s tructu re . Following the suggestion of Boethius (2.4), one can play u pon the opposition 'male/female' in many ways ( for example, as shown in Figure 2 . 1 3 ) , so creating (accord i ng to different contexts) different op­ positions, antonymies , and semantic similarities .

Katz designs, for a n ideal dictionary competence , a criterion: "an ideal speaker of a language receives an anonymous letter containing just one sentence in that language, with no clue a bout the motive , circumstances of transmission, or any other factor relevant to understand ing the sente nce on the basis of i ts context of u tterance . . ." ( 1 977: 1 4 ) . This c ri te rion d raws a sharp line that divides semantic (dictionary) compe­ tence and pragmatic and encyclopedic competence. The semantic com­ ponent represents only those aspects of meaning that an ideal speaker/ hearer wou l d know in such an anonymous letter s i tuation.
Now, we can certai n ly admit that an anonymous letter reading when you will enter that log cabin you willfind a man is absolutely u nambiguous. Accordi ng to the d ictionary he or she refers to, the addressee will be sure to meet, in that log cabin, either an adult male h uman being or a mortal rational animal. The situation turns out badly if the anonymous letter reads whatever you willfind entering that log cabin it will not be a man. What should one expect to see in that place? A woman, a crocodile, a ghost, a bronze statue?

Since the speakers of natu ral languages have few opportuni ties of re­ ceiving anonymous letters, let us consider a more 'normal' situation. During the night, looking out of the window of her home in the coun­ tryside, a wife tells her h usband : Honey, there is a man on the lawn near the fence! Now, su ppose that her husband controls the situ a tion and answers : No, honey, it's not a man . . . . I t would be absolu tely unclear w h a t the husband means , what he is negating and what s u rvives his negation. The 'thing' in the lawn can be a boy, a boa constrictor escaped from the nearby zoological garden, a tree, an alien invader, a dog, the giant teddy bear left there by their childre n , the shadow of a tree.
Naturally, the husband can have the i n tention of scaring his wife by prod ucing a feeling of u neasiness and suspense ; but, in this case, we are no longer concerned with semantic questions, b u t with a more complex pragmatic s trategy based on reticence. The husband, in this case, exploits the nature of the encyclopedia in order to achieve a rhetorical effect.
However, we are now considering the case in which the h usband really wants to say something 'clear' i n order to communicate to his wife that he actually thi nks about the thing in the lawn. He should then say that that thing is not a man but (alternatively) a boy, a dog, a spatial creature, a tree , and so on. I n doing so, he has not to go on without a dictionary; he must simply build up and presuppose the same 'local' portion of d ictionary he assumed as i m plicitly outlined by his wife in uttering her sentence . The husband m u s t make some conj ec tu re or ab­ duction about the ad hoc dictionary that both speakers , i n that s i tuation , take for granted . Once having evaluated the s ituation of the u tterence , the husband has reasonably conjectured that, by u ttering man, his wife was magnifying or blowing up certain semantic properties and narcotizing some others (see Eco 1 979, 0 . 6 . 2 ) .
Probably the wife was n o t interested in t h e fact that m e n are mortal or hot-blooded animals; she was interested in their being rational only in­ sofar as to be rational means to be able to conceive evil i n tentions. In other word s , a man was to her something potentially aggressive, able to move inside. I f the thing were a child , it woul d be fel t as nonpotentially aggressive; if i t were a dog, i t would be felt as u nable to intrude; if it were a tree or a giant teddy bear, it would be felt as unable to move. On the contrary, a spatial alien would be viewed as a moving and potentially aggressive being. We can also s u ppose that each alternative elicits the retrieval of a given frame such as 'burglars i n the nigh t' , 'lost child' , 'space invaders' , ' the thing from the o u ter world' , and so on.
Thus the husband is committed to u tter, along with the negation of man, the assertion of some other being that does not contain one or more of the frightening properties . Consequently, he should figure ou t an ad hoc Porphyrian tree, more or less i n the format of the one i n Figure 2 . 1 4 .

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

The encyclopedia is the regu lative hypothesis that allows both speak­ e rs to figure out the 'local' dictionary they need in order to ensure the good standing of their communicative inte raction . The s uccess of the interaction will eventually prove that their hypothesis was the good one . Moreover, even if the husband wanted to implement a strategy of reti­ cence , he equally needed this hypothesis, in order to know how to create the d u e suspense . He had to know that by deleting man he was excluding that the thing in the lawn was a human, dangerous, walking thing, but he was not excl uding that it was a nonhuman, dangerous, walking thing.
A natural language is a flexible system of signification conceived for producing texts , and texts are d evices for blowing up or narcotizing pieces of encyclopedic information .

2.J.s. The encyclopedia a s labyrinth The project of an encyclopedia competence is governed by an u nderly­ ing metaphysics or by a metaphor (or an allegory): the idea of labyrinth. The u topia of a Porphyrian tree represe n ted the most i nfluencial attempt to red uce the labyrinth to a bidimensional tree. B u t the tree again gen­ e rated the labyrinth.
There are th ree types of labyrinth. The fi rst, the classical one, was linear. Theseus entering the labyrinth of Cre te had no choices to make : he could not but reach the center, and from the center the way out. That is the reason by which at the center there was the M i notaur, to make the whole thing a l ittle more exciting. Such a l abyrinth is ruled by a blind necessity. Structurally speaking, it is simpler than a tree: it is a skein, and, as one unwinds a skein, one obtains a continuous line. I n th is kind o f labyrinth t h e Ariadne thread i s u seless , since o n e cannot get lost: the labyrinth itself itself is an Ariadne thread . This kind of labyrinth has nothing to do with an encyclopedia, irrespective of its im­ portant and venerable symbolic meanings.
T h e second type is c a l l e d in German lrrgiirten or lrrweg; a good E n-

gl ish term for i t i s maze. The maze i s a Manneristic invention; iconologi­ cal ly speaking, it does not appear before the late Renaissance . A m aze displays choices between alternative path s , and some of the paths are dead ends. In a m aze one can make mistakes . If one u nwinds a maze, one gets a particular kind of tree in which certain choices are privileged in respect to others . Some alternatives end at a point where one is ob­ liged to return backward s , whereas others generate new branches , and only one among them leads to the way out. In this kind of labyrinth, one does need an Ariadne thread ; otherwise, one might spend one' s life in turning around by repeating the same moves. A Porphyrian tree can be­ come a m aze of this type, especially if reformulated as in 2 . 4 . A maze does not need a Minotaur: it is its own Minotaur: in other words, the Minotaur is the visitor's trial-and-error process.
In a labyrinth of the third type is a net ( m aybe the word meander characterizes it as different from a maze and from a plain labyrinth ) . The main feature of a net is that eve ry point can be connected with every other point, and , where the connections are not yet designe d , they are , however, conceivable a n d designable. A n e t is an unlimited territory. A net is not a tree. The territory of the United States does not oblige anybody to reach Dallas from New York by passing through St. Louis, Missouri; one can also pass through New Orleans. A net - as Pierre Rosenstiehl ( 1 980) s uggests - is a tree plus corridors connecting i ts nodes so as to transform the tree into a polygon, or into a system of embedded polygons. But this comparison is still misleading: a polygon has some borderlines. On the contrary , the abstract model of a net has neither a center nor an outside .
The best image of a net is provided by the vegetable metaphor of the rhizome suggested by Deleuze and Guattari ( 1 976). A rhizome is a tangle of bulbs and tubers appearing like "rats squ irming one on top of the other." The characteristics of a rh izomatic structure are the follow­ ing: (a) Every poi n t of the rhizome can and must be connected with every other point. (b) There are no points or positions in a rhizome; there are only lines (this feature is doubtful : inte rsecting li nes make points ) . (c) A rhizome can be broken off at any point and reconnected following one of its own lines. (d) The rhizome is antigenealogical. (e) The rhizome has its own outside with which it makes another rhizome; there fore , a rh izomatic w hole has neither o u tside nor inside. ( f) A rhizome is not a calque bu t an open chart which can be connected with something else in all of its dimensions; it is dismountable, reversible, and s usceptible to continual modifications. (g) A network of trees which open in every direction can create a rhizome (which seems to us equiva­ lent to saying that a network of partial trees can be cut out artificially in every rhizome). (h) No one can p rovide a global description of the whole

[82]

'SEMIOTICS AND THE P HILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

rhizome; not only because the rhizome is multidimensionally compli­ c a te d , b u t also because i ts s t ructu re changes thro u gh the t i m e ; moreover, in a structure i n which eve ry node can b e connected with every other node, there is also the possibility of contradictory inferences: if p, then any possible consequence of p is possible, including the one that, instead of leading to new consequences , leads agai n to p , so that it is true at the same time both that ifp, then q and that ifp, then non-q. (i) A s tructure that cannot be described globally can only be described as a potential sum of local descriptions. (j ) I n a structure without outside, the describers can look at it only by the inside; as Rosenstiehl ( 1 97 1 , 1 980) suggests , a labyrinth of this kind is a myopic algorythm; at every node of it no one can have the global vision of all its possibilities but only the local vision of the closest ones : every local description of the net is a hypothesis, subj ect to falsification, about its fu rther course; in a rh izome blindness is the only way of seeing ( locally), and thinking means to grope one's way. This is the type of labyrinth we are i n terested in. This rep re­ sents a model (a Model Q) for an encyclopedia as a regulative semiotic hypothesis.
A midway solution between the tree and the rhizome was the one proposed by the E ncyclopedists of the E n l ightenment. Trying to trans­ form the tree into a map , the eighteen th-century encyclopedia, the Encyclopedie of Diderot and of d' Alembert, made in fact the rh izome th i n k a b l e .
In respect to its hierarchical s tructure , the eighteen th-century ency­ clopedia was not necessarily differen t from a tree. What does make i t d is tinct is, in t h e first place, t h e hypothetical nature of t h e tree: it does not reproduce a presumed structure of the worl d , but presents itself as the most economic solution with which to confront and resolve a particu­ lar problem of the reunification of knowledge . In the second place , the encyclopedist knows that the tree organizes , yet impoverishes, its con­ tent, and he hopes to determine as precisely as he can the intermediary paths between the various nodes of the tree so that l i ttle by little it is transformed i n to a geographical chart or a map .
D' Alembert, i n his preliminary discourse on the E ncyclopedie, fur­ nished information about the criteria for the organization of the work. I n one respect, he develops t h e metaphor of t h e tree; in another, he p u ts i t into question, speaking instead of a word map a n d a labyrinth :

The general system o f the sciences a n d arts i s a k i n d of labyrinth, a tortu­ ous road which the spiri t faces without knowing too much about the path to be followed .
But this disorder (however philosophical it b e for t h e mind) wou ld disfig­ u re , or at least would entirely degrade an encyclopedic tree in which it

Dictionary vs. E ncyclopedia

[83]

would be represented. Our system of knowledge is ulti mately made up of different branches, many of which have a simple meeting place and since in departing from this point it is not possible to simultaneously embark on all the roads, the determination of the choice is up to the nature of the individ­ ual spirit. . . . However, the same thing does not occur in the encyclopedic order of our knowledge which consists in reuniting this knowledge in the smallest possible space and in placing the philosopher above this vast labyrinth in a very elevated point of perspective which would enable him to view with a single glance his object of speculation and those operations which he can perform on those objects to distinguish the general branches of h u man knowledge and the points dividing it and u niting it and even to detect at times the secret paths which unite it. It is a kind of world map which must show the principal countries , their position and their reciprocal dependencies . It must show the road in a straight line which goes from one point to another; a road often interrupted by a thousand obstacles which migh t only be noticed in each country by travelers and its inhabitants and which could only be shown in very detailed maps. These partial maps will be the different articles of the encyclopedia and the tree or the figurative system w i l l be its world map. Yet like overall maps of the world on which we live, the objects are more or less adjacent to one another and they present different perspectives according to the point of view of the geographer com­ posing the map. In a similar way, the form of the encyclopedic tree will depend on the perspective we impose on it to examine the cultural uni­ verse. One can therefore imagine as many different systems of hu man knowledge as there are cartographical p rojections .

D' Alembert says with great clarity that what an encyclopedia repre­ sents has no center. The e ncyclopedia is a pseudotree, which assumes the aspect of a local map, i n order to represent, always transitorily and locally, what in fact is not representable because it is a rhizome - an inconceivable globality.
The universe of semiosis, that is, the u niverse of human cultu re , must be conceived as s tructured like a labyrinth of the third type : (a) It is s tructured accord ing to a network of interpretants. (b) It is virtually infinite because it takes into accou n t multiple interpre tations realized by differ­ ent cultures: a given expression can be interpreted as many times, and i n as many ways , as it has been actually interpreted in a given cultural framework; i t is infinite because every d iscou rse about the encycl opedia casts in doubts the previous structure of the encyclopedia i tself. (c) It does not register only 'truths' but, rather, what has been said about the truth or what has been believed to be true as well as what has been believed to be false or imaginary or legendary, provided that a given culture had elaborated some d iscourse about some subject matter; the encyclopedia does not register only the 'historical' tru th that Napoleon died on Saint Helena but also the 'li terary' truth that Juliet died i n Ver-

ona. (d) Such a semantic encyclopedia is never accomplished and exis ts only as a regulative idea; it is only on the basis of such a regulative idea that one is able actually to isolate a given portion of the social encyclo­ pedia so far as it appears u seful in order to interp ret certain portions of actual discourses (and texts). (e) Such a notion of encyclopedia does not deny the existence of s tructured knowledge; it only suggests that such a knowledge cannot be recognized and organized as a global system ; i t provides only 'local' and transito ry systems of knowledge , w h i c h c a n b e contradicted b y alternative a n d equally 'local' c u l tu ral organizations; eve ry atte m p t to recognize these local organizations as unique and 'global' - ignoring their partial ity - p roduces an ideological bias .
The Porphyrian tree tried to tame the labyrinth. It did not s ucceed because it cou ld not, but many contemporary theories of language are s till trying to revive this i m possible d ream.

:z.J.6. The dictionary as a tool
After having demonstrated that the theore tical idea of a semantic rep re­ sentation in the format of a dictionary is u n tenable, we shoul d , however, remind ourselves that d ictionary-like represen tations can be used as suit­ able tools.
The system of hyperonyms provided b y a dictionary represents a way to save 'definitional energies' . When one says that a rose is a flower, one does not suggest that ' flower' is a primi tive that cannot be interpre ted ; one simply assumes that, for the sake of economy, in that specific con­ text, all the properties that are commonly assigned to flowers should not be challenged . Otherwise, one would say a rose is a flower, but. . . .
In the example of h usband and wife provided a bove ( 2 . 3 . 4) , the hus­ band knows that there is no absolu te and unique representation of man,
bu t - exactly because of this - he is obliged to figure out an ad hoc dictionary-like local rep resen tation in order to ensure the good stand ing of that conversational interaction. In Chapter 3 of this book we shall see that, in order to generate and to interp ret metaphors , according to the model proposed , one must rely also on d ictionary-like representations . D' Alembert has suggested that, in order to make up a flesh-and-body encyclopedia, one certainly knows that each of its items can be included in differe n t classes accord ing to the description under which it is con­ sidere d , but at the end (and even though transitorily) an item must be included in a given class, thus 'freezing' its representation in the format of a provisional d ictionary.
When P u tnam lists 'liquid' among the semantic markers of water, he uses that hyperonym because he assumes that, in order to provide a definition of water, he is not interested in challenging all the properties that are usually assigned to liquids. It is by virtue of this shorthand deci-

sion that he can exclude from the s te reotypical properties of water those of being physically perceptible, wet, and s u bject to evaporation; h e as­ su mes that these are all properties that we assign to liquids without chal­ lenging them - until the moment that a sudden change in the scientific paradigm will oblige our culture to cast i n doubt the very notion of liq­ uid . The fu nction of hyperonyms in a lexical system depends exactly on the epistemological decisions that govern the life of a culture . We can make u p d ictionary-like representation in order to save definitional energies in any context in which certain 'cen tral' assumptions of a cul­ tural system are taken for granted. We presu ppose a local dictionary every time we want to recognize and to circumscribe an area of consensus wi thin which a given discourse should s tay , because no single discou rse is designed to change globally our world view.
Thus, if the encyclopedia is an unordered set of marke rs (and of fra mes , scripts, text-oriented instru c tions ) , the d ictionary-like ar­ rangements we continuou sly provide are transitory and pragmatically useful hierarchical reassessments of it. I n this sense, one should turn upside down a curren t distinction between d ictionary (strictly 'semantic' ) and encyclopedia (pollute d with 'pragmatic' elements); on the contrary , the encyclopedia is a semantic concept and the dictionary is a pragmatic device.
One could wonder abou t a more profound reason for all this. One can legitimately ask whether there is a ' universal' or ' biological' reason by which certai n properties seem to be more ' d ictionarial' than others . Un­ doubtedly, we frequently challenge the opinion that men are cruel or reasonable and that dogs are men' s best friends, but less frequently we challenge the common and strong belief that both are animals. Quine ( 1 95 1 ) has already answered this question : every culture has a strongly organized 'center' and a more and more fuzzy 'peri phery' , and , in order to change i ts central concepts , one must expect a rad ical scientific revo­ l ution. Certain d ictionary properties are such - and more resistantly re­ main as such - by virtue of this cultural inertia. These properties are not 'dictionarial' on logical or biological grounds, but on historical grounds. Our representations usually respect this heri tage, for many intu itive rea­ sons . M a ny properties that inhabit the higher nodes of so m a ny dictionary-like trees (such as 'living being' or ' body' or 'physical') have been profoundly rooted in the world view of our culture for millennia. I t is not impossible, however, to think of a new discourse in which these concepts become the target of a critical deconstruction of our cultural parad igm. Chapter 3, on metaphor, will show that sometimes a poetic text aims at destroying exactly our most unchallengable assumptions; in these cas_es i t can happen that colorless green i deas can (and maybe must) sleep furiously, and we are obliged to suspect that perhaps ideas are more 'physical' than we usually believe. Thus the i n terpretation of a

metaphorical text requ i res the greatest flexibility, on the part of the in­ terpreter, in rearranging the most venerable and higher nodes of cu rrent d ictionaries.
I n more common con texts , one can decide that certain properties are more 'focal' , more 'central ' , more ' d i agnostic' , more resi s ta n t than others. Once having recognized that the dictionary is not a stable and u nivocal image of a semantic universe, one is free to use it when one needs it.

J . I . The metaphoric nexus
The " most luminous and therefore the most necessary and frequent" (Vico) of all tropes, the metaphor, defies eve ry encyclopedic entry. I t has been the obj ect of phi losophical , lingu istic , aesthetic, a n d psycholog­ ical reflection since the beginning of time. S hibles' ( 1 97 1 ) bibliography on the metaphor records around 3 , 000 titles ; and yet it overlooks authors such as Fontan ier, and al most all of Heidegge r and Greimas - and of course it cannot mention, after the research i n componential semantics , the successive studies on the logic of natu ral l anguages, the work of Henry, Groupe f.L of Lieges, Ricoeur, Samuel Levi n , and the latest text-linguis tics and pragma tics .
The term metaphor for many authors - and this is true for Aristotle and E manuele Tesauro - has served to indicate every rhetorical figure in general; the metaphor, as the Venerable Bede put it, is "a genus of which all the other tropes are species." To speak of metaphor, therefore , means to speak of rhetorical activity in all its complexity. And it means , above all, to ask oneself whether it is out of blind ness , laziness, or some other reason that this peculiar synecdochic view of metaphor has arisen , whereby the part is taken a s representative o f the whole. I t is very dif­ ficu l t indeed to consider the metaphor withou t seeing it in a fra mework that necessarily includes both synecdoche and metonymy - so difficult, in fact, that a trope that seems to be the most primary will appear in­ stead as the most derivative, as the result of a semantic calculus that presupposes other, preli minary semiotic operations. A curious situation for a figure of speech that has been recognized by many to be the basis of every o ther.

SEMIOTICS AND THE PHILOSOPHY OF LANGUAGE

Not the least of the contradictions encountered in a metaphorology is that, of the thousands and thousands of pages written about the metaphor, few add anything of substance t o t h e first two or th ree fu n­ damental concepts stated by Aristotle . In effect , very l i ttle has been said about a phenomenon concerning which, it seems, there is everything to say. The chronicle of the discussion on metaphors is the chronicle of a series of variations on a few tautologies, perhaps on a s ingle one: "A metaphor is that artifice which permits one to speak metaphorically." Some of these variations, however, constitute an 'epistemic break' , allowing the concepts to drift toward new territories - ever so sligh tly, but just enough . It is with these variations that we shall be concerned .
Every d iscourse on metaphor originates in a radical choice : either (a) language is by nature , and originally, metaphorica l , and the mechanism of metaphor establishes li ngu istic activi ty, every ru le or convention aris­ i ng thereafter in order to discipline, to reduce (and im poverish) the metaphorizing potential that defines man as a symbolic animal; or (b) language (and every other semiotic system) is a ru le-governed mecha­ nism, a predictive machine that says which p h rases can be generated and which not, and which from those able to be generated are 'good' or 'correct' , or e ndowed with sense; a machine with regard to which the metaphor constitu tes a breakdown , a malfu nction, a n u naccountable outcom e , bu t at the same time the d rive toward linguistic renewal. As can be seen, this opposition re traces the classical one between phusis and nomos, be tween a nalogy and anomaly, motivation and arbitrariness. B u t the problem is to see what ensues when we accept one or the other of t h e two horns of this d i l e m m a . I f i t is metaphor t h a t founds language, i t is impossible t o speak of metaphor un less metaphorically. Every d efini­ tion of metaphor, then, cannot but be circular. If instead there exists first a theory of language that prescribes 'literal' li nguistic outputs, and if within this theory the metaphor constitutes a scandal ( that is, if the metaphor is a deviation from such a system of norms) , then the theoreti­ cal metalanguage must speak of something to define which has not even been devised. A merely denotative theory of language can indicate those c a s e s w h e re l a n g u a ge i s incorrectly u s e d b u t appears to say some­ thing - but such a theory is embarrassed to explain what and why. Con­ sequently, it reaches for tau tological definitions of the following type: "There is a metaphor every time something unexplainable happens which the users of a language perceive as a metaphor."
B u t the problem does not end there . When closely studied in connec­ tion with verbal language, the metaphor becomes a source of scandal in a merely linguistic framework, because i t is in fact a semiotic phenomenon permitted by almost all semiotic systems. The inner natu re of metaphors p roduces a shifting of the l inguistic explanation onto semiotic mecha-
