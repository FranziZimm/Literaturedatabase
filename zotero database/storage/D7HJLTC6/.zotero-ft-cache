Abstract
Studies on gestures in South Africa contribute to research on quotable gestures/emblems, gestural variation, language typology and co-speech gesture, cross-cultural variation and gestural pragmatics, and the relationship between culture and the nature of co-speech gesturing and its development. Studies of the quotable gestural repertoire of urban Bantu language speakers examine the semantic and structural characteristics of these gestures as well as their communicative and social functions. Social meanings attached to gestures and gestural behavior influence variation in gestural behavior based on situational context, age, gender, and social identity. Inter-ethnic comparisons show that different cultural groups ascribe different meanings and pragmatic values to gesture use and other non-verbal behaviors. Language structure influences the types of co-speech gestures Zulu speakers employ. Cross-linguistic comparative work demonstrates that cultural values shape the nature of discourse genres, such as narratives, and consequently the kinds of co-speech gestures Zulu speakersusewhennarrating.Thesedifferencescanaccountforwhysomefeaturesofco-speechgestures develop differently in Zulu speaking children’s narratives.
1. Overview
Studies of gesture in South Africa have focused on the nature, function, and social meanings of gestures and gestural use among urban Bantu language speakers in Johannesburg townships (Brookes 2001, 2004, 2005, 2011), variation in gestural behavior (Brookes 2004, 2005; Kunene 2010), cross-cultural variation in gesture and gestural pragmatics (Kunene 2010; Ribbens 2007; Schutte 2001; Scott and Charteris 1986), the nature and development of co-speech gesturing among Zulu speaking children and adults (Kunene 2010), and the influence of culture on gestural development (Kunene 2010). Opondo (2006) refers to the prominent role of gesture in South African Zulu song and dance, and there is reference in one study to the use of gesture in traditional South Sotho children’s games (Ntsihlele 2007). However, these two studies do not provide any systematic analysis of gesture use. Studies on gesture in South Africa contribute to four areas of gesture research: quotable gestures/emblems, variation in gestural behavior, language typology and gesture, cross-cultural variation and gestural pragmatics, and the impact of cultural norms on gesture and gestural development.

VI. Gestures across cultures

2. Quotable gestures/emblems
Urban Bantu language speakers in Johannesburg townships make use of a large repertoire of quotable gestures/emblems. These gestures have established forms and meanings, can occur independently of spoken language and are part of a recognized gestural vocabulary. A list of quotable gestures can be found in Brookes (2004) with photographs and descriptions of their forms and meanings with an analysis of their semantico-grammatical types and semantic domains. Township residents also make use of a kinesic code comprising a set of gestures specifically for hailing minibus taxis, a major form of transport in the region. Woolf (2010) has published drawings of the different taxi gestures and their corresponding destinations used in Johannesburg.
Similarly to Poggi’s (1983) and Payrato´ ’s (1993) analyses of Italian and Catalan quotable gestures, the South African repertoire of quotable gestures can be divided into two main semantico-grammatical categories, lexical gestures (equivalent to single words that can convey different communicative acts depending on context), and holophrastic gestures (complete communicative acts whose performative function does not vary) (Brookes 2004). A number of lexical gestures have related stabilized variations in the movement of the stroke, manner of performance, or the positioning/orientation of the hand that convey established communicative acts called derived holophrastic gestures (Poggi 1983).
The semantic domains of lexical gestures include everyday objects and activities, e.g., gestures for telephone, lock, eat, and sleep. A proportion of lexical gestures represent common activities, objects, and topics of conversation among young men, such as gestures for drinking alcohol, gambling, soccer, clothing items, sex, and marijuana. Similarly to other repertoires of quotable gestures (see Kendon 1981; Payrato´ 1993) most of the holophrastic gestures in the South African repertoire are gestures of interpersonal control Ϫ commands, apologies, refusals, insults, promises (42 percent), and evaluative comments about others (39 percent). Twelve percent are expressions of one’s personal state and seven percent are gestures that comment about general states of affairs.
There is also a small proportion of quotable gestures that function like lexical gestures in that they can convey different communicative acts, but unlike lexical gestures are not closely tied to a single meaning. Rather this kind of gesture expresses a range of polysemous meanings related to a core underlying abstract concept or semantic theme. Kendon (2004) suggests that some of these types of gestures represent values that are of particular importance to the community in which they occur. Brookes (2001) analyzed the role of one of the most prominent of these concept gestures in the South African repertoire. The gesture involves the first and fourth fingers directed towards the eyes while the hand moves diagonally up and downwards across the face. Users commonly gloss this gesture as clever in the sense of being streetwise and city slick. It expresses a range of meanings all related to the underlying concept of seeing or perception such as “You are streetwise”, “Look out”, “Be alert”, and “I see you” (as a greeting). It also accompanies words that describe a person as quick thinking, witty, and entertaining characteristics considered streetwise. The gesture functions as an act of approval and inclusion that expresses the core interactional function of distinguishing between insider and outsider status in black urban communities. The clever gesture symbolizes this streetwise and city slick identity among urban black South Africans who wish to see themselves as part of a modern progressive urban African identity in contrast to the backward, primitive, and tribal African from the rural areas.

Longitudinal ethnographic work on South African quotable gestures shows that there are some quotable gestures that endure over long periods of time, others fall into disuse, change their forms, and new gestures emerge to become part of the established gestural vocabulary (Brookes 2004, 2011). Quotable gestures that mark common speech acts such as greeting, negation, or agreement, express key ideological concerns such as the clever gesture or express taboo topics that are a consistent part of the gestural repertoire. However, in the case of some taboo topics, a new form may replace the old form of the gesture when it becomes too well known (Brookes 2004). Several lexical gestures representing objects and practices that are no longer popular die out. In one case, a new quotable gesture emerged for the Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) in response to the speech taboo against suggesting a person was sick or had died because of HIV. As the stigma decreased with the introduction of antiretroviral drugs that can prevent death, so has the use of the gesture (Brookes 2011).
Township residents use quotable gestures as a substitute for speech when speech is impossible, over long distances, or secret exchanges, or when speech is inappropriate, to avoid interrupting an ongoing interaction. Speakers also use quotable gestures in conjunction with speech for rhetorical effect. However, use of quotable gestures is most prominent in the communicative interactions of male youth in their late teens and twenties. Young men integrate quotable gestures into spontaneous co-speech gesturing. This gesturing occurs in conjunction with a male youth anti-language spoken on the township streets sometimes referred to as Tsotsitaal or Iscamtho (Brookes 2001). Skillful use of speech and gesture in entertaining ways is part of linguistic performance that indexes a streetwise and city slick identity crucial for gaining and maintaining access, acceptance, and status within male social networks.
An analysis of how male youth use quotable gestures in relation to speech shows that they function in similar ways to co-speech gestures (Brookes 2005). Quotable gestures not only depict aspects of the content of utterances, they are also integrally involved in marking discourse structure and regulating exchanges. Quotable gestures represent, modify, or add information to what is said in speech and their manner of performance contributes to the illocutionary force of the message, indicates the type of speech act performed, and directs and regulates the interaction. Most importantly they structure discourse into information units with gesture phrases visually demarcating spoken units while the gesture stroke gives prominence to the information focus of the message. The intended textual meaning plays an important role in how speakers organize gestures in relation to spoken units of information. The greater the rhetorical effect, the better the linguistic performance, and gestures play a key role in these linguistic performances.

3. Variation in gestural behavior
Observations of gestural behavior among Bantu language speakers in black urban townships around Johannesburg show that the way in which speakers use gesture varies (Brookes 2001, 2004, 2005). Speakers modify the types of gestures they use, gestural frequency, and use of space based on interlocutor identity, age, gender, and social distance. Two thirds of the quotable gesture repertoire is used by the general population, while the other third is associated mainly with use by male youth, with only two percent of quotable gestures considered to be exclusively women’s gestures (Brookes 2004). Ges-

VI. Gestures across cultures

tural behavior indexes social distance and respect, the latter being a key value among black South Africans. Excessive gesturing is seen as disrespectable. Gestures become more frequent and prominent in informal contexts where participants are of equal status. Although gesture is most highly elaborated among male youth in peer group interactions, the way young men gesture among their peers is not appropriate in other contexts nor is it appropriate for women to gesture in a similar way. Gestures and gestural style may be a key part of expressing a male streetwise and city slick township identity, but excessive use of gesture indicates disrespectability and delinquency or criminality in township society. Gestural styles also index different “sub-cultural” affiliations among male youth. The gendered nature of gestural variation has also been observed in work on the development of Zulu children’s gestures (Kunene 2010). Boys of 11 and 12 years and adult males used a larger physical gestural space than females in the same age cohorts in elicited narratives and also employed quotable gestures unlike their female counterparts (Kunene 2010). Kunene (2010) attributes these differences to cultural expectations of linguistic performance among male peers during adolescence and early adulthood.

4. Gesture and language typology
Kunene (2010) has provided the first account of how Bantu language structure shapes the nature of co-speech gesturing. She compared gestural development in the narratives of French and Zulu children and adults and found that the greater number of representational gestures among Zulu when compared to French speakers was partly due to Zulu connectives having subject markers that track the referent. Cohesive devices such as “as” and “then” gave rise to representational gestures that tracked the referent among Zulu speakers. As Zulu is a pro-drop language, it does not require a lexical subject. Concords or agreement prefixes refer to the subject by indicating its subject class. Anaphoric reference can be ambiguous for example when a speaker refers to an object and subject from the same class. The speaker may then disambiguate the message by using representational gestures to refer to the referents. Kunene (2010) also observed a developmental aspect to reference tracking with connectives. As Zulu speakers move towards the adult norm they increasingly use class neutral connectors that require more representational gestures to disambiguate the referent. Kunene (2010) suggests that the move to class neutral markers would partly explain why Zulu speaking adults used more representational gestures than Zulu speaking children in her study.

5. Cross-cultural variation and gestural pragmatics
Scott and Charteris (1986) compared Southern African’s interpretations of Morris et al.’s (1979) twenty emblems/gestures with those of the Europeans. They sampled a hundred Southern African Caucasians comprising equal numbers of males and females and an unspecified number of Southern Africans of African decent in major cities in South Africa and Zimbabwe. The authors did not include the data from those participants of African descent due to methodological problems. However, they noted that Southern Africans of African descent did not recognize seven out of twenty emblems, and the meanings they provided were quite disparate to both Europeans and their Southern African Caucasian counterparts. Comparing Southern African Caucasian’s knowledge of Morris et al.’s (1979) twenty gestures with the European responses, nine gestures

1151

elicited similar interpretations from both groups. Their results showed higher levels of recognition and semantic congruence for gestures that are established emblems in Britain from where a large proportion of South African and Zimbabwean Caucasians originate. However, overall lack of congruence led them to conclude that gestures are mostly culture dependent and that Morris et al.’s (1979) gesture inventory was unsuitable for interethnic comparisons in Southern Africa.
Ribbens (2007) and Schutte (2001) have carried out inter-ethnic comparisons of nonverbal behavior between English and Afrikaans speaking South Africans of European descent and Bantu language speakers. They found that the two groups ascribed different values to certain gestures and non-verbal behaviors. Ribbens (2007) and Schutte (2001) identified pointing and beckoning with the forefinger, a gesture commonly used by South Africans of European descent to tell a person to “come”, as highly offensive to Bantu language speakers. Schutte (2001) describes the different meanings cultural groups attach to various handshake forms and their manner of performance. He also identifies the “purse hand” as appropriate for indicating the height of a person among Bantu language speakers who regard the hand with palm down, often used by South Africans of European descent to describe a person’s height, as offensive. The negative value ascribed to some gestural forms also extends to other non-verbal behaviors such as substituting a smile for a spoken greeting, a common practice among English speaking South Africans but considered offensive by Bantu language speakers (Ribbens 2007), and appropriate eye contact or avoidance in interactions (Schutte 2001). Several studies on speech acts in Zulu such as requests and politeness markers (de Kadt 1992, 1994, 1995) and expressing gratitude (Wood 1992) where gestures rather than speech express “please” and “thank you”, suggest a more prominent role for gestures as politeness markers among Bantu language speakers. Ribbens (2007) points out that these different cultural patterns of coordination between speech and gesture can result in misinterpretation of speaker intention in intercultural communication.

6. Culture and gestural development
Kunene’s (2010) comparative work on the development of discourse and co-speech gestures in French and Zulu children’s narratives (five to twelve years) shows that co-speech gestures increase with age in both cases, and Zulu and French speaking children younger than ten years are at a similar level of multimodal development in relation to the adult norm (Kunene 2010). Types of gesture also change with age (Colletta, Pellenq, and Guidetti 2010). French and Zulu speaking children produce a higher proportion of nonrepresentational type gestures than French and Zulu speaking. Similarly to French children, Zulu speaking children had a higher proportion of integrating type gestures that add preciseness to their speech while adults had more supplementary gestures that provide additional information (Kunene 2010).
However, there were some developmental differences that could be attributed to cultural norms. Zulu speakers tended towards more detailed narrative accounts when telling a story and produced more narrative clauses than French speakers who provided more summarized versions with more non-narrative clauses as they moved towards the adult norm. Zulu speakers produced more gestures with their narratives as well as more representational and supplementary gestures than their French counterparts who had more discursive and framing gestures. Kunene attributes these differences to how speak-

1152

VI. Gestures across cultures

ers from different cultures perceive the nature of the storytelling task. Cultural expectations require that Zulu speakers provide detailed sequential accounts while French speakers tend towards a more succinct overview of the main narrative events (Kunene 2010). Zulu adults also gestured significantly more than 5 to 6 year olds and 9 to 10 year olds, while French adults’ gesture rate did not differ significantly from 9 to 10 year olds but only from 5 to 6 year olds. Kunene suggests that the nature of Zulu orature requires a level of co-speech gesturing that is not yet fully mastered by 10 or even 12 years of age.

7. Conclusion
These studies involving longitudinal ethnographic fieldwork, context-of-use studies, and comparative work provide insights into how sociocultural norms shape the nature of gestures, gestural behavior, and gestural development. South Africa provides a rich context in which to study gesture with a diversity of languages and cultures for crosscultural comparison along the lines of repertoires and form-meaning associations, the relationship between language typology and gesture, the relationship among culture, language and cognition, and the pragmatics of communication in which gesture plays a key role. The social, political, and historical context in which ethnic groups were kept separate under apartheid and the process of reintegration in the post-apartheid era may be a suitable context in which to address questions that scholars of gesture have raised (Kita 2009). How does cultural contact influence gestures? How do gestures spread and how do their meanings change or adapt with cultural integration? How do cultural differences shape language, gesture, and cognition? How is gesture use and gestural pragmatics influenced by cultural ideas and values? Other than the studies discussed in this review, no systematic comparative studies have been undertaken among different South African ethnic groups to address these questions. Nevertheless the studies reviewed make an important contribution to understanding the role of gesture as a communicative and social tool by placing gesture use in its sociocultural context.

Abstract
Most of the studies on gesture in sub-Saharan Africa focus on documenting the forms and meanings of conventionalized gestures such as pointing, repertoires of quotable gestures, and counting gestures. An important aspect of these studies, particularly work on pointing, has been to highlight how cultural and interactive norms shape gestural behavior. The role of gestures in oral-story telling and other art forms has also been a particular area of interest in the African context. In work on oral narratives, there has also been a focus on the relationship of ideophones and gestures. Studies on gestures in the African diaspora give support to other work showing the persistence of gestures over time. Many of these studies on gesture in sub-Saharan Africa highlight the conscious and often explicit importance attached to gesture and bodily conduct in many African cultures.
1. Introduction
The first comprehensive overview of studies on gestures and gesture use in Sub-Saharan Africa was published in French in 1971 by Baduel-Mathon. In her overview, BaduelMathon provides a bibliography and description of gestures that occur in three West African language families: the Agni-Ashanti, the Manding, and the Yoruba. Since then, there have been a number of studies published that also make an important contribution to knowledge about gestures and gestural behavior particularly in relation to pointing, quotable gestures, oral narratives, and ideophones.
2. Pointing
There have been two substantial studies on pointing practices in Sub-Saharan Africa. Kita and Essegbey (2001) analyze pointing in Ghana and Orie (2009) examines pointing among speakers of Yoruba in Nigeria. Both studies demonstrate that pointing practices are shaped by socio-cultural factors. Kita and Essegbey (2001) and Orie (2009) describe how different functions and social values are ascribed to the left and right hands and to the use of both hands. These functions and values affect how speakers use them when gesturing and pointing. Many African cultures associate the left hand with negative values and actions, and therefore there is a taboo against using it for giving, receiving, or eating. Pointing with the left hand is taboo among Yoruba speakers in Nigeria,

1155

in Ghana and in many cultures in sub-Saharan Africa (see Kita and Essegbey 2001; Orie 2009; Wilkins 2003). Pointing with the left hand is also taboo among the Igbo, the Iyala and the Hausa (Nigeria), the Gikuyu and the Luya (Kenya), and among the Chichewa (Malawi) (Orie 2009).
Orie (2009) suggests index finger pointing is also socially circumscribed in many African cultures. In her study of the Yoruba, hand pointing is generally viewed as more polite. Orie (2009) points out that index finger pointing to people may be taboo under certain conditions because of cultural beliefs about its supernatural powers. Index finger pointing is subject to social restrictions in terms of social hierarchy relating to age and status with status more important than age (Orie 2009). Orie (2009) documents a range of different forms of pointing among the Yoruba regulated by social and occupational status and context. The Yoruba also use five different lip points with gaze as a key component. Mouth pointing is also governed by social status and age. Nose pointing is derogatory and head pointing also has restrictions in relation to status and age. Again lip pointing, head pointing, eye pointing, and gaze are governed by social cultural constraints relating to age, status, and context.
The only other study of head gestures in Africa that we have found is McClave’s (2007) study of head movements among the Turkana who were nomadic pastoralists in northwestern Kenya. She bases her analysis on data from films made in the 1970’s by anthropologists David and Judith McDougall. McClave compares Turkana head movements (Turkana belongs to the Nilo-Saharan language family) with head movements among speakers from four different languages belonging to three unrelated language families. The Turkana do not have head movements for “yes” and “no.” However, similarly to speakers of Egyptian Arabic, Bulgarian, Korean, and African-American English, the Turkana have the same head movements for indicating inclusivity (lateral head sweep), to mark individual items on a list, and head orientation to refer to and locate a non-present referent in space.

3. Repertoires o conventional and quotable gestures
A number of publications contain descriptions of conventionalized and quotable gestures belonging to different cultural groups. Some of these accounts go back to the nineteenth century, such as Sibree (1887) who lists some gestures used in Madagascar. Another early account of African gestures is given in Westermann (1907) who describes gestures of the Ewe in Ghana as well as other forms of non-verbal communication, for example, conventions for marking the way or relevant spots in an area. Glauning and Huber (1904) describe gestural conventions for greeting in East Africa. In his account of the Hausa people and culture, Tremearne (1913) gives a list of 30 Hausa gestures.
After these studies, there seems to be a break in the study of gestures in the first half of the twentieth century. The publications of Baduel-Mathon (1969; 1971) signal a renewed interest in (quotable) gestures. One of the most important contributions to gesture studies in Africa is Creider’s work. Creider (1977) published various gesture studies including repertoires of conventional gestures for four Kenyan languages. In addition, three publications appear on Swahili gestures and one on gestures in Central Africa (Claessen 1985; Eastman and Omar 1985; Hochegger 1978). Creider (1977) documented a total of 72 quotable gestures in East Africa among the Luo, Kipsigis, and Samburu who speak Nilotic languages and the Gusii who speak a Bantu language. The Luo, Kipsigis, and Gusii are geographically adjacent to one another. Sixty-eight percent of

the quotable gestures identified were common to all four groups. He also compared their gestures to gesture vocabularies for North America and Columbia (Saitz and Cervenka 1972). The east African groups had 24 percent and 31 percent of gestures in common with the North American and Columbian repertoires. The gestures that were common are also found among many other groups as they represent common human interactions, actions, or depictions of space and size. In addition to this work, Creider (1978) presents an analysis of the relation between intonation, tone, and gesture in Luo, followed by a cross-linguistic comparison of this relation in Luo, Kipsigis, and Gusii (1986). Creider shows that, “there is a close relationship between the character of certain kinds of body movements and the intonational structure of a language” (1986: 148). He finds crosslinguistic differences in the alignment of body movements/gestures with speech depending on whether stress is used to mark pause groups, and whether stress is used to mark emphasis.
Eastman and Omar (1985) describe verbal independent gestures that are used only without speech and verbal dependent gestures that are only used with speech among Kenya coastal Swahili speakers. The latter they call verbal/visual or gestural/speech units because speech and gesture combine to create a specific meaning that separately would be meaningless. In the case of verbal independent gestures, these range from gestures that can be glossed with a sentence to gestures that are purely exclamations and have no verbal gloss or equivalent. In 1983, Omar and Morell produced a video recording of Swahili gestures demonstrating their form and use. Claessen (1985) also gives an account of the gestures of native speakers of Swahili, including a set of body-based measure gestures, in which the arm is used as a measure stick that is delimited by the other arm/ hand. A similar type of gesture is mentioned for the Luo in Kenya (Creider 1977). Hochegger (1978) gives a richly illustrated repertoire of conventional gestures in Central Africa but does not specify the language groups involved. Kirk and Burton (1976) take an experimental approach on conventional gestures, using a judged similarity test with speakers of Maasai and Kikuyu to determine whether speakers classify gestures according to their meaning or to their form. Speakers were found to assess similarity among emblems according to their verbal glosses rather than formal features. More recently, Brookes (2001, 2004, 2005, 2011) has published several articles on South African quotable gestures and their communicative functions among urban Zulu and South Sotho speakers in Johannesburg townships.

4. Counting gestures
Several studies have focused on the use of gestures for counting in various African cultures (e.g. Caprile 1995; Zaslavsky 1999). Gerdes and Cherinda (1993) describe counting among the Yao of Malawi and Mozambique, the Makonde of Mozambique, the Shambaa of Tanzania and Kenya, and the Sotho of Lesotho. Hollis (1909) cites a unique set of fourteen counting gestures among the Kenyan Nandi. Gulliver (1958) claims that speakers of Arusha Maasai use virtually the same counting gestures and so does Creider (1977) for speakers of Luo, Kipsigis, and Samburu. All languages in which this set of non-iconic counting gestures is found are part of the Nilotic language family. A more recent publication is Caprile (1995), who analyzes the relation between counting gestures and the spoken numeral systems in four Central Sudanic languages as spoken in Chad. Another recent publication is Siebicke (2002), who presents an analysis of counting,

including counting gestures, in Samo, a language of Burkina Faso. Number gestures seem to occupy a special position in oral narratives in Iraqw, a Cushitic language of Tanzania. In Iraqw stories, numbers are typically not pronounced by speech, but rather by gesture. The audience then verbalizes the number, which in turn is confirmed by the storyteller (Maarten Mous, personal communication, August 30, 2013).

5. Gestures in oral narratives
There have been a number of studies of gestures and the use of the body in oral narratives (Calame-Griauel 1977; Klassen 1999; Konrad 1994; Kunene 2010; Sorin-Barreteau 1996). In Africa, oral storytelling is still a significant part of daily life and informal storytelling is saturated with gestures (Klassen 1999). Klassen (1999) has studied hand gestures, body movements, and posture in Shona storytelling in Zimbabwe. She examines the semantic relation of gesture to speech and identifies four ways in which gestures in storytelling are imitative. Gestures can reenact an action or diagram it, they can metaphorically illustrate an abstract concept, gestures can place a story and its components in the gestural space of the speaker to represent various aspects of the story, and gestures can show direction, mood, pacing, and attitude including showing the reaction of one character to another. Klassen (2004) also points out that the timing of gestures corresponding with what the speaker wishes to emphasize visually provides the shape of the story. Gestures increase when the story nears its climax and may even replace speech at this point (Eastman 1992; Klassen 1999). Gestures, and particularly bodily movements, represent character and map objects and actions as well as making transparent the form and moral dimensions of a narrative.
Klassen (1999, 2004) also points out how body posture cues the type of story being told, its believability and the level of artistry of the storyteller. The storyteller’s position such as sitting may be a metaphor for social relations. Body posture and movement have strong moral connotations. Changes in body position often mark the structure of the story by changing when there is a change of scenes or genres (talking to singing) in the story (Klassen 1999). Similar kinds of observations are made by Calame-Griaule (1977) in her analysis of gestures accompanying a Touareg story from Niger, as well as by Konrad (1994) in her analysis of gestures accompanying a trickster story in the Ewe language of Ghana. Other work on storytelling is that of Sorin-Barreteau (1996), who gives an overview of over 628 conventional gestures for actions for the Mofu-Gudur language of Cameroon, as used in storytelling. In addition to oral literature, gestures may also play a role in other art forms. Thus, Groß (1977) presents an analysis of gestures and body positions in the Adzogbo dance of the Ewe people in Ghana. Thompson and Nsonde´ (2002) look in detail at conventional gestures and body postures of the Kongo culture in central Africa, as evident in (ceremonial) face-to-face interactions, dance, martial arts, and statues.

6. Ideophones and gestures
There have been several studies of ideophones and gestures (Dingemanse 2011; Klassen 1999; Kunene 1965). Gestures that accompany ideophones function differently from other gestures in storytelling (Klassen 1999). These gestures show the quality and length of the action and are essential to understand the ideophone’s precise meaning because

1158

VI. Gestures across cultures

these are usually idiomatic and only locally understood (Klassen 1999). Klassen also points out that ideophones for body movement have gestures and depict not only the movement but the moral character of the story character. Among the South Sotho, gestures co-occur with or substitute for ideophones and may even cause a new word to be coined (Kunene 1965). Dingemanse’s (2011) extensive work on ideophones in Siwu, the language of Mawu people in Ghana, found that previous claims that gestures almost always occur with ideophones are too strong. He argues that discourse type plays a role in the occurrence of gestures with ideophones. Gestures are more likely to occur with ideophones in “telling”. He also found that depictive gestures are more likely to occur with ideophones and be synchronized. Dingemanse (2011) suggests that the “tight coupling” of depictive gestures with ideophones are due to both being holistic depictions and two components of a single performative act.

7. Gestures in pre-colonial times: The trans-Atlantic slave trade and the diaspora
Extensive descriptions of conventional gestures do not seem to be found in publications prior to the nineteenth century. However, the use of gestures in communication in early contacts between Europeans and Africans has been mentioned in various earlier sources. Fayer (2003) reconstructs linguistic practices including the use of gestures in the Atlantic slave trade, based on data describing “sign language” in the journals of explorers, traders, travelers, missionaries, and plantation owners. The accounts of gesture use cited in this article go back as far the fifteenth century. Fayer concludes however that reliance on African interpreters largely outweighed the systematic use of gestural communication for bridging the linguistic gap between the various parties. What has become clear, however, is that African gestures have been retained and transmitted by Africans crossing the Atlantic, as evident in the analysis of gestures in African diaspora communities.
There are a number of studies describing gestures, body postures, and stance taking in the African diaspora. A number of studies focus on the use and function of non-verbal communication in marking identities and framing conversations, e.g., Cooke (1972), Goodwin and Alime (2010) and Kochman (1972). Some of these studies focus on the African origin of non-verbal behavior in African diaspora communities. A well-known example of gestures found in various communities, both in Africa as well as in Guyana and the West Indies, are the “cut-eye” and the “suck-teeth” gestures, as described by Rickford and Rickford (1976). A detailed analysis of the use of the suck-teeth gesture in Guyana is presented in Patrick and Figueroa (2002). The study of Thompson and Nsonde´ (2002) mentioned above on gesture and posture in the Kongo culture actually aims at identifying similarities between the Kongo culture and African diaspora cultures in South-America.

8. Conclusion
Although we have tried to present a comprehensive overview of publications in this area, it is likely that we may have omitted studies published in languages other than English and French. Nevertheless this review shows that studying gestures in Africa gives insights into our understanding of the social, linguistic, and cognitive aspects of human gestural behavior. These studies highlight the conscious and often explicit importance attached

74. Gestures in the Sub-Saharan region

to gesture and bodily conduct in many African cultures. Eastman and Omar (1985), Creider (1977, 1978, 1986), and Orie (2009) give important descriptions about how people in many different African cultures have indigenous terminology to talk about gestural and other forms of non-verbal behavior. Olofson (1974) provides a detailed description of Nigerian Hausa language about facial expressions, gaze, and hand gestures, based on theatrical stage directions, as well as interviews. However, there is a dearth of studies on gestures and gestural behavior in Africa and much more needs to be done.

Abstract
Several communities in Ghana, as in many other African countries, observe a restriction on left-hand use (henceforth taboo). This paper reports on two studies carried out on left-hand taboo in Ghana. The first study was conducted with Sotaro Kita among the Anlo (Ewe) people in Keta in the Volta Region of Ghana. The second, and more recent study, was conducted among the Dwang people in Kwame Danso in the Brong Ahafo Region. The lefthand taboo occurs in three main domains, namely eating, giving and receiving, and pointing. These three domains belong to an implicational hierarchy such that people aware of the giving and receiving taboo necessarily know of the eating taboo while those who know about the pointing taboo also know of the giving and receiving taboo. There are different ways to mitigate the negativity associated with the left-hand use, especially as regards giving and receiving. Furthermore, the taboo itself has given rise to a number of pointing gestures such as semi-pointing and hyper-contra-lateral pointing (cf. Kita and Essegbey 2001).
1. Introduction
Several years ago when I was an undergraduate student at the University of Ghana, I was eating rice with a spoon held in my left hand when a friend (let’s call him Sam) came by. Following customary practice, I invited him to come and eat the rice from the same bowl with me. Sam picked a spoon and was about to commence eating when he noticed that I was holding mine in my left hand. He stopped and told me that he wouldn’t be

able to eat the food if I ate with the spoon in my left hand. A cousin also recently narrated an experience he had: he was buying a piece of cloth at a stall in the market when someone stopped by to enquire about the price of one of the cloths on display. The stall owner got upset because the man had pointed out the cloth with his left hand. She complained until the man left without making a purchase. My cousin joked that the woman was willing to forego a sale just because of her disapproval over the use of the left hand.
Ghana has restrictions on the use of the left hand which come in different forms: the most basic one involves a prohibition against eating with the left hand (henceforth “eating taboo”). Since we eat most meals with our fingers, a child is taught right from tender age to use only the right hand to eat. This means that even though I am left handed, I can only eat with my right fingers and, thus far, I haven’t encountered any Ghanaian brought up in Ghana who eats with his or her left fingers. It is clear from my incidence with Sam that attitudes differ when it comes to the use of cutlery; my parents did not try to get me to change that. The next restriction regards giving and receiving things (henceforth “give/receive taboo”). In this case too, parents guide children right from infancy to use their right hand when they give or receive a gift. The image of a parent pushing away a child’s extended left hand and pulling out the right hand to receive something is one that is known to every Ghanaian. A similar situation has been observed in Tanzania where Brain (1977) reports of a parent smacking the left hand of a child as young as 12 months old when he extended it to receive a banana. The final restriction regards pointing with the left hand (henceforth “pointing taboo”) either for the purpose of indicating a directed path or the direction toward a location. In fact most Ghanaian languages have proverbs that caution against violating the pointing taboo. The one in Dwang, a Guang language spoken in the Brong Ahafo region of Ghana, is cko´ mabe me kebene sε´re be´twccre me Awu´ ‘no one points to Awu with his/her left hand’ (Awu is the town of the paramount chief). Yet, despite the fact that an equivalent of this proverb exists in almost every Ghanaian language, it is not everyone who knows that restriction on the use of the left hand extends to pointing. The three taboos therefore constitute an implicational hierarchy, as represented below, such that knowledge of the one on the right implicates knowledge of the one(s) on the left:
Eat → give/receive → point
There are a number of ways to mitigate a violation of the give/receive: first of all, if it occurs because the violator’s right hand is soiled, then he or she could use the left hand to give/receive while at the same time extending the soiled hand. Among the Ewe, this may be accompanied by the expression emia hee ‘note the left’ and the response is asie´ ‘it is a hand.’ Some people use the expression only without extending the soiled hand. The Ga in the capital city Accra would say miiha bo abekum ‘I am giving you the left’ while the Akans, the largest linguistic community, say memma wo benkum ‘I am not giving you the left’. These expressions show that the taboo is not restricted to one specific linguistic community.
The restrictions on left hand use are not peculiar to Ghana. They have been reported in several parts of Africa (Brain 1977; Orie 2009). Harris (1990: 197) also writes: “Most Western countries today hold liberal views about left hand uses but in each case, there was a time when left hand use was forbidden or strongly discouraged for certain acts.”
Not surprisingly, the restrictions have consequences on gesture among the Ghanaian community. In this paper, I report on results of a study carried out with Kita in Keta, a

town in the Volta region of Ghana and a smaller, more recent, one carried out in Denu, Tegbi (both in the Volta region) and Kwame Danso, a newly created district capital in the Brong Ahafo region. The Keta study sought to find out people’s knowledge of the restrictions and how that affected their pointing gesture. The discussion of this part of the study draws heavily on discussions in Kita and Essegbey (2001). The more recent study sought to establish how people deal with the dimensions on the taboo and what influences its violation. The rest of the paper is organized as follows: in section 2 I discuss data collection. Section 3 looks at the results while section 4 discusses the impact of differing awareness of the taboos and familiarity on gesturing and section 5 concludes the paper.

2. Data collection
2.1. Pointing study
As stated in the introduction, the Keta study sought to establish how the left hand taboo affects pointing gestures and, secondly, the contexts in which Ghanaians produce taboo defying gestures. To accomplish this, we had an interviewer stand at a T-junction in Keta, facing the direction of oncoming traffic. There he stopped people coming towards him to ask them about directions to Rose Pavilion and Chief Amegashie’s palace. The former was a few blocks away to his right (but to the left of anyone facing him), while the latter was located to his left. After getting the direction he would then interview the direction-givers about their knowledge of and views on the left hand taboo. The interviews were recorded from a distance surreptitiously. After the interview participants were debriefed and consent was obtained to use the material. In all, 28 participants were interviewed out of which two declined permission. We therefore used the interviews and directions of the remaining 26.
2.2. Hand-restriction study
The more recent study aimed at testing the effect of restricting the right hand on the give/ receive and pointing taboos. As such I told interviewees that they were expected to identify species of fish in a book and give directions to specific locations. Unlike the Keta study, participants undertook the task while they were eating, which also meant that they were seated. In all, we interviewed 11 people spread over three locations: 3 in Denu, 2 in Tegbi and 6 in Kwame Danso. Those from Denu and Tegbi, like their counterparts in the Keta study, were native speakers of Ewe, a Kwa language, while those in Kwame Danso were native speakers of Dwang, a Guang language also of the Kwa family. In addition, they were all bilingual in Akan, the dominant regional language. The interviewees in Denu were a mother, daughter, and son, and they performed the task while eating together (see Fig. 75.6). I handed a booklet to the daughter, who is the elder of the two children and asked her to provide the Ewe names of species of fish found on a page in it. I then asked her to pass the booklet on to her brother. He was then asked to pass it on to his mother. Note that because the book was given to them while they were eating, they were confronted with the prospect of simply collecting it with their left hand and thereby breaking the taboo, using their right hand and thereby soiling the book, or collecting it with the left hand while accompanying it with the right. After they had attempted to name the fishes, I asked them in turn to tell me the location of two places not far from where we

1164

VI. Gestures across cultures

were. Finally, if they used their left hand anytime during the interview, I asked them why. If they did not, I asked them why not. The Tegbi scenario was similar, with the differences that the two people were interviewed separately, and I had an elderly woman hand the booklet to them, although I did the questioning. In the Kwame Danso case, they were questioned by an interviewer who was also a native speaker of Dwang. Note that this means that unlike the Keta study these people knew from the outset that they were being filmed and they knew the person who interviewed them.

3. Results
The results are divided into three sub-sections. In the first one I simply look at the number of people who used the left hand and the ones who did not. I then turn to strategies for avoiding the use of the left hand. Finally, I look at the type of left-hand gestures made by those who did make them.
3.1. Tally
Of the 26 people whose directions and interviews we used for the Keta study, 16 reported that they knew about the left hand taboo while 10 were not particularly aware of it. As the implicational hierarchy above shows, not everyone is aware that the restriction extends to pointing. Not surprisingly, 9 out of the 10 people who were not aware that the restriction extended to pointing used the left hand at least once in their pointing gestures. That means only one of them did not use the left hand. In contrast, 5 of the people who were aware of the restriction did not use it. That still leaves a whopping 11 who did use their left hand.
For the recent study, 5 people collected the book with their left hand only while 5 extended the right hand simultaneously and 1 person actually held it with both hands thereby soling it. The same number of people (i.e., 5) used their left hand to return it, although they were not the same people, and the one person who collected it with both hands returned it in the same manner. Regarding pointing, 10 out of the 11 people made a left hand pointing gesture at least once.
3.2. Avoiding le t-hand use
Although very few people did not use the left hand at all, there were strategies for minimizing it. One involved immobilizing the left hand while the other involves making contra-lateral and hyper-contra-lateral pointing. In Kita and Essegbey (2001) we reported that interviewees assumed a “respect posture” which involves placing both hands on the buttocks with the palms facing outwards. Since the people needed to give directions with a hand, they kept only the left hand at the back and used the right. This is illustrated by Fig. 5 of Kita and Essegbey (2001) which I reproduce below as Fig. 75.1a.
Note that the man giving directions in Fig. 75.1a has the left hand firmly placed on his buttocks with the palms facing outwards. For those in a seated position immobilization involves placing their elbow firmly on their thigh or on the arm of a chair, if it has one. This limits the mobility of the left hand and forces them to use only the right hand, as illustrated by Madame B in Fig. 75.1b who was part of the Kwame Danso interviewees.
Interviewees also engaged in a lot of contra-lateral pointing in order to avoid using the left hand, and a few engaged in “hyper-contra-lateral” pointing whereby they had

1165

Fig. 75.1b: Immobilized hand and hyper-contralateral pointing

to strain to get their right hand to point to something behind them to the left. Note that in Fig. 75.1a and 75.1b, the interviewees have their right arms practically wrapped around their neck in order to point with their right hand to a location on the left.
3.3. The di erent types o le t hand use
As indicated in the section on tally, interviewees did use the left hand in a number of situations. These are “semi-pointing”, bi-manual and what I characterize as the “leftright asymmetry”. They are discussed in turn.
3.3.1. Semi-pointing
In Kita and Essegbey (2001: 78), a semi-pointing is described thus:
Semi-pointing is performed only with the left hand, and has the following formal characteristics. [It] is performed below the waist, usually with a fully-stretched arm. In some cases all fingers are extended, and in other cases only the index finger is extended. It makes a small movement to the left or to the left-front to indicate a direction away from the body. The right hand is also simultaneously but separately pointing to the left, and it is either in its preparation phase or in its hold phase.
An illustration from Fig. 2 of the paper is provided below:

Fig. 75.2: Semi-pointing

1166

VI. Gestures across cultures

The interviewee is pointing to Rose Pavilion which, if she faced the interviewer, would be to her left. She therefore turns slightly and uses her right hand to point out the location while at the same time making a smaller pointing gesture with her left index. In Kita and Essegbey, we wondered whether the interviewer was aware of that gesture. Since then, I have tried to find out from several Ghanaians whether they consider the semi-pointing gesture to be pointing and they replied in the negative. In fact, for a number of them, it was only when I actually drew their attention to it that they noticed that the person is doing something with her left finger as well. It is therefore safe to conclude, as we did tentatively in Kita and Essegbey, that semi-pointing does not violate the left hand taboo. Because of their seated position interviewees in the later study did not make semi-pointing gestures.

3.3.2. Bi-manual strategy
We noted in Kita and Essegbey that this is part of a general principle according to which the use of the left hand is not considered to be offensive when used together with the right. This can be when one is receiving an object or pointing, as illustrated in Fig. 75.3a and 75.3b:

Fig. 75.3a: Receiving booklet with both hands

Fig. 75.3b: Pointing with both hands

In Fig. 75.3a Mr D. collects the booklet with the left hand while supporting it with the right hand. In Fig. 75.3b, YB partially extends both arms in order to point to a location on his left.
3.3.3. Le t-right asymmetry
Unlike semi-pointing, some left handed gestures are more pronounced than semi pointing and yet still occupy much less space than the right hand. The three pointing gestures by Mr. C. illustrate this.
In Fig. 75.4a, Mr C. says mc´ febo kontragye nem´ fae´yε a εbo kebena´ se´ ‘when you take the main road and go it is on the left.’ He opens the left hand outwards at the mention of kebena´ se´ (literally left top). However, as the figure shows, the left arm is kept quite close to the body, thereby reducing the gesture space. Mr C. quickly retracts it as he continues ckpe´ nem´ ckyce kale´ a, cbo kebena´ se´ ‘the road that branches like this, it is on the left,’ he uses the right hand instead in an expansive contra-lateral pointing gesture (Fig. 75.4b).

In her case, she rather avoids extending the index finger in the leftward direction but instead, curls her wrist and points a pistol-shaped hand forward rather than in the leftward direction (which is also in the direction of the interviewer). By so doing she avoids pointing her extended left index finger at the interviewer. Note that when she does a contra-lateral pointing gesture, she points her right index finger in his direction.
4. Implicational hierarchy and amiliarity
In this section I discuss the effect of the implicational hierarchy as well as familiarity between participants on gesturing. Recall that the interviewees in Denu were mother, daughter, and son. The daughter collected the booklet from me with her left hand accompanied by the right hand and did most of her pointing gestures with her right hand. However, she gave the booklet to her younger brother with her left hand and he, in turn, received it with his left hand. Fig. 75.6 shows that handing over and receipt of the booklet between mother and son was also with the left hand.
When I asked them at the end of it all why this was the case, the daughter replied that it is not proper to collect things with the left hand. She said she gave it to her brother with her left hand because it is her brother and, besides, he is younger than her. For her, therefore, the familiarity brought about by kinship as well as the fact that her brother is younger played a role in her violating the taboo. Her brother thought the restriction doesn’t apply when one is eating. He did not know that one could mitigate the left hand taboo by accompanying it with the right hand. Their mother admitted that she hadn’t taught them. She said that growing up she respected the restrictions until she went to work as a teller at a bank where they were trained to ignore it. This is because they constantly had to use both hands in interaction with customers, most often receiv-

ing or giving money with one hand while entering figures in a ledger with the other. Invariably, it was the left hand that they ended up using to hand money to customers.
Note that the implicational hierarchy proposed above means that some may be particular about some taboos while completely oblivious to others. Mr D. in Tegbi studiously accompanied the left hand with the right when he wanted to collect the booklet (see Fig. 75.3a). However, when the time came for him to point out directions, he used only his left to do so. He later explained that he didn’t know that pointing with the left hand is a taboo. The final person who used the left hand because of ignorance was seven-year old K. from Kwame Danso. K. had apparently been told about the give/receive taboo. However, he did not know about the pointing taboo. Neither did he know what to do about the give/receive taboo when the right hand is occupied. As a result he received the booklet with his left hand and used the hand to make pointing gestures. This suggests that while parents teach children at early age to give and receive things with the right hand, the intricacies of what to do when the right hand is occupied is not comprehended until later.
5. Conclusion
This paper has shown that while every Ghanaian knows that there are restrictions on the use of the left hand, knowledge of the restriction differs from person to person and, to some extent, this determines where and when people use the left hand. For instance those who know the give/receive taboo but not the point one would point with the left hand even while avoiding the use of the left hand to collect/receive a thing or, if they have to use it, accompany it with the right hand. Still those who know all the restrictions still use the left hand. In many cases, this is noticeably different from that of the right hand, such as semi-pointing, which is not noticed and therefore not considered a taboo. Other such uses are the reduced gesture space for the left hand, and pistol hand pointing.
My study shows that some people, including those aware of the taboo do break it. Some do it unconsciously and apologize when their attention is drawn to it. Others do so because of familiarity with their interlocutor, or because they don’t attach much importance to the taboo. The position of the mother interviewed in Denu reflects the influence of Western traditions (i.e., banking) on changes in attitudes towards the taboo (cf. Payne 1981). Her daughter also remarked that they see on the TV that “people abroad” use their left all the time. She said therefore that in school they don’t pay particular attention to the taboo except when they are with a particularly strict teacher.

Abstract
This chapter focuses on the role of contact gestures and touch for the organization of conversations among the Wolof of Northwestern Senegal. As an example, it analyses a short interactional episode and pays special attention to the role of these gestures for turntaking, turn-allocation and attention management. It will become apparent in the analysis that in general, constant bodily contact is common in Wolof conversations. Conversational functions that are fulfilled in Western conversations by gaze (selection of addressee, signaling of listenership) are adopted by touch and contact gestures among the Wolof. Moreover, gestures are often combined with touch or even performed in tactile ways so that the body of the interlocutor is used as a resource. In the course of an interaction, a gesture can be transformed into touch and vice versa. The hands employed in conversation offer a constant resource for different interactional moves. The Wolof co-interactants, as it appears, use their senses (as semiotic resources) in a different way than assumed by canonical Conversation Analysis and Goffmanian interactionist sociology.

activities has been called “pragmatic” by Kendon (2004) and Streeck (2009). According to Streeck (2009: 179) gestures are pragmatic “when they themselves enact a communicative function”, for example “when a raised hand, palm facing the interlocutor, admonishes him to wait his turn”. Streeck emphasizes, however, that “pragmatic gestures are an unruly bunch: speakers show all manner of idiosyncrasies in making them” (2009: 181). They are coupled with interaction units “such as turns, turn-construction units, speech acts, and speech act sequences” (Streeck 2009: 179). Kendon (2004: 159) adds that the interactive and interpersonal functions of pragmatic gestures equally include “indicating to whom a current utterance is addressed, to indicate that a current speaker, though not actually speaking, is nevertheless still claiming a role as speaker (still ‘holding the floor’)” and to “regulate turns at talk, as in raising a hand to request a turn, or pointing to someone to give them a turn”. Both authors give more examples that cannot be considered here.
Streeck emphasizes the multifunctionality of the hand, which serves as means not only for “action and expression”, but also for “cognition and knowledge acquisition” (Streeck 2009: 39). Although Streeck himself mostly refers to the interaction with objects or the environmental situation, what he says is equally true for interactions and interpersonal communication:

The hands often participate in tactile (and haptic) and visual contexts at once, which provides for easily intelligible connections between the two sensory realms. Hand-gestures enable translations between the senses. Thus, in a powerful way, the dual nature of the hand is recruited for communicative purposes; tactile features of the world, presently available only to a single party, are visually broadcast to everyone present. (Streeck 2009: 70)

Yet, it is precisely the role of touch for conversational organization that has been widely ignored in the theoretical literature on interaction. The literature on touch appears to be highly biased since it works on the premise that touch is the “most intimate way of communicating” (Jones 1994: 18). The only studies that accord to touch the status of a “semiotic resource” (Goodwin 2000) are inquiries into medical interaction. For Heath (1986: 50), for example, medical interaction is particularly interesting, because the patients are at the same time the objects of inquiry (tactile among others) and the subject of social interaction. Nishizaka (2007) explores the “multi-sensory accomplishment of reference” in the examination of pregnant women by midwives in Japan.
In regard to cross-cultural differences in touching behavior, some scholars (cf. Watson 1970) distinguish between whole “contact” and “non-contact” cultures.
Although touching has mostly been excluded from gesture studies, Efron ([1941] 1972: 120), in his inventory of Jewish gestures in New York City, conceives of “grasping of [the] wrist or of wearing apparel”, “shaking”, “poking”, and “pulling”, as “[e]nergetic modi of physical persuasion”. An example is the Jewish “buttonholing”: the act of fumbling with the jacket of the interlocutor as an expression of affection (Efron 1972: 132, 135).

2. Gesture and touch in the organization o Wolo conversations
Some of the functions that Goodwin (1981) has assigned to gaze for American communication (such as speaker allocation at turn transition or the display of addresseehood and hearer roles) are occupied in Wolof conversations by gesture and touch. The first example shows a situation in which Maggat (MG) competes with Jajji (JJ) about Ba’s (BA)

attention. He does so not only through vocal devices but also through gesture and touch. In the transcripts presented here, the line ‘To’ describes the touching behavior, ‘Gt’ provides a transcript of the other manual gestures, ‘Gz’ marks direction of eye gaze, ‘St’ indicates the still image referred to, and ‘Tr’ gives a gloss in English of the speech.
In 01, Maggat (MG) tries to get Ba’s (BA) attention through the employment of several different resources. For one, he uses verbal summoning devices (“I tell you”, “you see”) and restarts in his utterance. Secondly, he touches, or better, grasps Ba’s (BA) right foot with his right hand. Thirdly, he addresses Ba (BA) with gaze and gesture. One can see quite well that he first addresses him with gaze, then withdraws his gaze and makes an “open hand horizontal palm down” gesture. The gesture is executed with a slow horizontal movement as if to calm down or stop its addressee softly. While Maggat (MG)

gazes at Ba (BA) during its preparation, he withdraws gaze during the proper performance of the gesture. In 04, Maggat (MG) again tries to acquire Ba’s (BA) attention by grasping his foot and then by pointing at him with a one beat hand gesture. Since in 05, Jajji (JJ) makes a concurrent utterance, Maggat (MG), in 06, again seeks Ba’s (BA) attention using verbal summons, another pointing beat and touch. In this moment, he not only grasps Ba’s (BA) foot, but he also shakes it as an augmentation of attention request, maybe in an urgent reaction to Jajji’s (JJ) utterance in 05.
Shortly later, Maggat (MG) succeeds in breaking Ba (BA) and Jajji’s (JJ) renewed dyadic interaction by pulling Jajji’s (JJ) hand out of Ba’s (BA) in 51. Jajji’s (JJ) hand had rested in Ba’s (BA) for 20 seconds. Maggat’s (MG) pulling gesture is supported by a vocal summons.
In what follows, Maggat (MG) invokes a traditional dictum that he visualizes by performing a gesture using the fingers of Jajji’s (JJ) hand. In 52Ϫ54 in examples 76.2 and 76.3 he takes Jajji’s (JJ) hand as an object to perform a “counting gesture” (cf. Creider 1977: 6Ϫ8). Doing so, he intensely gazes at the gesture performed with both his and Jajji’s (JJ) right hands, presumably in order to draw Jajji’s (JJ) attention to it. Accordingly, Jajji (JJ) also gazes at his hand rested in Maggat’s (MG). The practice of looking at one’s own gesture and thereby drawing the attention of the interlocutor towards it has already been described by Streeck (1993).

1174

VI. Gestures across cultures

Fig. 76.5: “My Fulani”
Jajji (JJ) is virtually forced to address his attention to Maggat (MG). He gazes at him and reacts with vocal hearer signals (continuers) and head nods. Maggat (MG) thus seems to have succeeded in virtually pulling Jajji (JJ) out of the dyad with Ba and into his own.
3. Conclusion
We have seen that in conversations among individuals of equal rank among the Wolof, gestures are sometimes combined with touch or even performed in tactile ways using the co-interactionalist as co-performer and object. In the course of an interaction, a gesture can be transformed into touch and vice versa. Particularly the hands employed in conversation offer a constant resource for different interactional moves. In general, constant bodily contact is common in Wolof conversations. However, since some semiotic resources (touch, gesture, vocal signals) substitute for others (gaze), the senses are by no means employed in one overall way, as Watson’s distinction in “contact” and “noncontact” cultures would suggest. Rather, Wolof conversations are evidence of a “contact culture” in some situations and of a “non-contact culture” in others.
This entails that an interaction might be established and maintained by different resources including mutual gaze, gesture, and bodily contact according to the situation.

The Wolof co-interactants, as it appears, use their senses (as semiotic resources) in a different way than assumed by canonical Conversation Analysis and Goffmanian interactionist sociology.

VI. Gestures across cultures

1. Historical overview
Body language and gesture studies in South America have had as main objectives the subjects of meaning-making and conceptualization, as well as inquiries to overcome the dichotomy between verbal and nonverbal communication, and analogical and digital forms of communication in cultural relations.
In the academic world, the study of signs began in the 1970s with the linguistics. Saussure’s (1972) book was translated to both Spanish and Portuguese. Besides linguistics, literary signs were initially studied through structuralist and poststructuralist approaches. The theories of Barthes, Greimas, and Eco were used as academic models. Lotman’s model was embraced by cultural studies. From semiology to semiotics, there was a shift in the 1990s to Peircean semiotics. The books that influenced scholars on body language were authored by Kendon, Harris, and Key (1975), Laver and Hutcheson (1972), Prieto (1967) and Sarduy (1973) in the Spanish-speaking countries. Weil and Tompakov’s (13th edition, 1999) book was translated into several languages and has been a best-seller since its appearance. Rector and Trinta (1986, 1990) contributed with gestures in the Brazilian culture.
From the 1970s onwards, books and articles have been published on nonverbal communication influenced mainly by Ekman and Friesen’s (1969), Bouissac’s (1973), and Desmond Morris’s (1979) models. In the 1980s, body language studies were active, but soon they were replaced by cultural studies in the beginning of the 1990s. Edward T. Hall (1977) gave place to Stuart Hall. At the end of the 20th century, McNeill’s (1992, 2000) model started being used for interaction of gestures and speech.
The aspects of gesture, body language, and kinesics, which have been most developed are mainly facial signs, gaze, haptics (tactile communication), proxemics, and chronemics.
However, nonverbal communication does not have a predominant space in South America. It has always been part of another discipline or field of knowledge.
The creation of Latin-American Federation of Semiotics (FELS) united researchers in Latin America (1987). The Latin-American Federation of Semiotics publishes the journal deSignis of which two volumes were dedicated to gestures: deSignis 3 (2002) “Los Gestos, Sentidos y Pra´cticas” and deSignis 14 (2009) “El Gusto Latino”. Extensive bibliography on different countries, with innumerous articles on body languages and gestures, can be found in Signa (Signa: Revista de la Asociacio´n Espan˜ola de Semio´tica 7, 1998) entitled “Panorama de la semio´ tica en el a´mbito hispa´nico” with articles on Chile, Mexico, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, and Uruguay, and a second volume (Signa 9, 2000) with articles on Colombia and Argentina. The International Conference on Gestures, which counted with a large number of participants from South America also gives an insight of the interest in the field in the proceedings (Oporto, Portugal, 2000; Gestos: Uso e Significado, 2003 and Gestures: Meaning and Use, 2003).
Initially the theoretical framework for studies on gestures is the lexical method of gestures, using segmentation of the flux of movements and following linguistic models. The entries combine representations and graphic description. The represented gestures can be rendered verbally, therefore glossaries and dictionaries of gestures started being published. The evolution of the studies show that the initial lexical units and syntagms developed from “word” to “discourse” in an interaction of actions and reactions whenever there is an emitter and a receptor, having to adjust constantly in their nonverbal interaction.

2. Research
As to gestures, two tendencies can be seen in recent studies. There is an American and a European tendency. There are the followers of McNeill and Kendon, and there are those with a cultural and social approach who pursue the French Greimasian group led by Fontanille and Coquet, distinguishing a body of existence (worldly body), a body of experience (the body itself) with a third socialized body (a body as a cultural configuration). The followers of McNeill work with varieties of gestures, how they function, and express thoughts. The concept of “growth point”, that is, gestures and speech studied jointly as a unit is frequently used. Kendon’s communication in face-to-face interaction is a model for interaction in everyday conversations and how the different roles in the construction of utterances function. Fontanille’s theory is used by scholars who work with visual arts and mass communication, from the written to the visual world as stated in the title of his book Se´miotique du Lisible au Visible: Se´miotique du Texte et de l’Image. Coquet’s theory is used as a theoretical framework for analyzing philosophical points of view and the phenomenology of language.
Besides the traditional fields of research, there are some new areas in which body communication plays a major role: Computer engineering with human-computer interaction; organizational semiotics based on insights into organized behavior and enacted social practices; Inter Psi (Laborato´ rio de Psicologia Anomal´ıstica e Processos Psicossociais, University of Sa˜o Paulo), an integration of the study of semiotics, interconnectivity and consciousness; and speech therapy, integrating nonverbal signs and gestures to coach TV anchors and presenters on how to convincingly convey their messages, furthermore new reporters began this training (Cotes).
With the universe perfused by signs, different ideas have been welcomed, developing in diverse directions to try to explain the world, especially in business, marketing, traveling, and job interviews.
In Latin America, culture and nonverbal communication studies contrasting with other cultures, especially North-American, are in demand. Their importance lies in the fact to avoid misunderstandings. Words and gestures which are innocent in one culture are offensive in another. Etiquette is also part of these studies, dealing with expectations regarding good manners to avoid faux pas. Intercultural competence is essential to grasp the variation of perception and behavior in the modern world.

3. Studies on body language and gestures in some South American countries
An overview of the main research fields and current ideas in some countries is given below. The selection depended on organizations that foster these studies and on individuals who impulse activities themselves.
3.1. Argentina
In the 1970s, Argentina was in the foreground in Latin America. France produced a boom in linguistics and semiology. Luis E. Prieto contributed greatly before moving to Europe. The foundation of the Argentinian Semiotic Society in the 1970s consolidated the previous work. Its journal LENGUAjes already innovates in the graphic cover.

1178

VI. Gestures across cultures

Names such Juan Carlos Indart, O´ scar Steimberg, O´ scar Traversa, Claudio Guerri, and Eliseo Vero´ n have led innovative research. Ana Laura Maizels is working on the dimension of gestures with the Argentinian president Cristina Ferna´ndez de Kirchner. The recent publication Nona´gono Semio´tico, un Modelo Operativo para la Investigacio´n Cualitativa (Claudio Guerri, Mart´ın Acebal, and Cristina Voto 2013) is an example of the state of art in semiotic studies in Argentina and how a conceptual model can serve as a framework for qualitative analyses.

3.2. Brazil
Initially, in the 1970s, Algirdas J. Greimas’s line of research influenced scholars such as Edward Lopes and Eduardo Pen˜ uela Can˜ izal, who created a study group and the journal BACAB-Estudos Semiolo´gicos, that later on became Significac¸a˜o, Revista Brasileira de Semio´tica. In the 1980’s, body language and gesture studies became popular with the translation of books by Corraze, Davis, Fast, and Hall. In the 1990’s, cultural studies took over the academic world and emphasis was given to text and discourse studies, currently a major concern for linguistics in Brazil, and intersecting with semiotics.
Studies of signs in Brazil focus, on the one hand, on social research linked to behavior and, on the other hand, on multimedia and technology. Nonverbal communication, especially tacesics, has been used intensively when dealing with patients in the medical field.
The only institution that was able to develop semiotics as a discipline in itself, was the Pontifical Catholic University of Sa˜o Paulo. Body language and gestures are integrated in the program of communication and semiotics, created by Maria Lu´ cia Santaella Braga. This program has an online journal: Estudos Semio´ticos. Directly or indirectly linked to this programs are the following institutes and centers: Instituto Brasileiro de Linguagem Corporal (Brazilian Institute of Body Language), Programa em Lingu´ıstica Aplicada e Estudos da Linguagem (Program in Applied Linguistics and Studies of the Language), Centro de Estudos do Corpo (Center for Studies of the Body); G´ıcia Amorim is one of the main contributors.

3.3. Chile
In Chile, besides the traditional fields mentioned above, there is a main research trend about the role that memory and language play in studies of cognitive processes. Some papers review the theory of how gestures facilitate working memory tasks both in children and adults, and how gestures influence the memory of students with developmental disorders and intellectual disabilities. Gestures also play a role in metaphoric understanding in cognitive sciences. Rafael de Villar Mun˜ oz has contributed in the study of mass communication and in the visual and audiovisual tools for education. He also directs the journal Revista Chilena de Semio´tica.

3.4. Colombia
Advertising has played an important role in sign studies since the foundation of the Uruguayan Association of Semiotic Studies by Lisa Block de Behar. This first phase was under European structuralist and poststructuralist influence. Kristeva’s semanalysis influenced women’s studies. Hilia Moreira focuses on television (teletheatre) and Tania Modleski on feminine issues. The gaze on women developed studies on the female body,

77. Gestures in South America: Spanish and Portuguese

1179

with emphasis on hidden aspects of culture such as menstruation and other “shameless” body aspects. Fernando Andacht studies the ‘disappeared bodies’ (los desaparecidos), with an ideological and political input. The anthropologist Zandra Pedraza Go´ mez has several publications, mainly on body and bio-politics. Armando Silva’s contributes with works on semiotics and social and audiovisual communication, as well as Jesu´ s Mart´ınBarbaro, born in Spain, but living in Colombia since 1967.

3.5. Mexico
Although the research in Mexico is not focused exclusively on body language, many studies are indirectly linked to the subject. The PowerPoint La semio´tica en Me´xico (https://www.google.com/search?qϭsemioticaϩenϩmexico&rlzϭ1C1TSNF_enUS437US437&aqϭf&oqϭsemioticaϩenϩmexico&aqsϭchrome.0.59j0l2.11005&sourceidϭ chrome&ieϭUTF-8 (02/27/2013)) gives an overview of the activities going on in this country as well as a bibliography.
Alfredo Cid Jurado is a main figure dealing with body language on television from a methodological perspective.
3.6. Venezuela
As in other South American countries, the interest of Venezuela in the study of signs started under French European influence, followed by Peirce’s theory, later on. They were mainly influenced by the Groupe de Recherches Se´mio-Linguistiques, of the E´ cole de Hautes E´ tudes en Sciences Sociales (Paris). Most scholars dedicated themselves to text analysis, Finol to myths, and Andre´s Garc´ıa Ildarraz to spatial and design analysis. There has also been interest in applying gestures to improving business relations. The Asociacio´n Venezolana de Semio´tica edits books on semiotics. Number 8 of the Coleccio´n de Semio´tica Latinoamericana is on Semio´ticas del cuerpo (‘Semiotics of the body’). Jose´ Enrique Finol has been of major influence in promoting these studies.

Abstract
The use of gesture in South American indigenous communities has only recently Ϫ with a more large-scale documentation and description of these languages Ϫ stirred the interest of scientific research. The few studies available so far are descriptive as well as cognitively oriented. While Nu´ n˜ez and Sweetser (2006) focus on how a conceptualization of time is reflected in the use of language and co-speech gestures by Aymara speakers, Floyd (in prep.) analyzes the spatial and temporal orientation of speakers of Nheengatu´ in a multimodal framework of language description. Reiter (2012), in her study of ideophones in Awet´ı, investigates the accompanying gesture-production.
1. Introduction
While Mesoamerican indigenous cultures moved into the focus of modern linguistic research already in the 1930s and 1940s, the native languages of South America continued to be predominantly studied by missionaries who had been trained in linguistics. They have received more scholarly attention only in recent times after a considerable progress in the field of documentary linguistics.
The same applies to research in South America related to conceptualization across cultures for which co-speech gestures have recently become important indicators. (For Mesoamerica the famous study of the Hopi’s conceptualization of time, carried out in the 1940s by the American linguist Benjamin Lee Whorf, must be mentioned in this context [cf. Carroll 1956]. Whorf’s analysis was critically assessed by Malotki [1983]. According to Malotki, the crucial point about Hopi is that it emphasizes aspect over tense which does not say anything obvious about conceptualization of time.) A first study to investigate the conceptual structuring of spatial information as revealed in spontaneous gestures in two related cultures was carried out by Kita, Danziger, and Stolz (2001). When comparing the hand gestures accompanying the narratives of Mopan Mayan people from Belize and Yucatec Mayans from Mexico, the authors found out that the two cultures differ in their use of the projected lateral (left Ϫ right) axis to represent location, motion, time flow, or plot development. From this differential use of gesture in the two cultures Kita, Danziger, and Stolz conclude that there is also a crosscultural difference in the conceptual structuring of space. A similar study, further outlined below, was carried out by Nu´ n˜ ez and Sweetser (2006) in two Aymara communities of Chile. Other studies of gesture in two Tupian groups of Brazil are rather descriptive: Floyd (in prep.) focuses on the use of pointing gestures for the indication of time, and Reiter (2012, 2013) analyses the interaction between co-speech gestures and ideophones.

These latter can be considered verbal gestures and have been the object of study in various South American indigenous languages under different perspectives. A noteworthy approach to ideophones in a lowland variety of Quechua carried out by Nuckolls (1996, 2001) will be presented in more detail in section 3 of this overview.

2. Pointing gestures or spatial and temporal orientation
Pointing gestures of different shapes were observed very early in South American indigenous languages. Key (1962: 94), when conducting fieldwork among Amazonian groups of Bolivia, mentioned that “many Indian tribes point with their lips; we recorded the Movima, Tacana, and the Ayoreo as using this gesture. But there were differences in executing this gesture; the Movimas do not accompany it with a thrust of the head as the other tribes do, but simply protrude their lips to point to an object.” More recently, Guillaume (personal communication) observed that in Cavinen˜ a, a Bolivian language of the Tacanan family, demonstratives are accompanied by lip pointing. The use of pointing gestures, including lip pointing, in combination with demonstratives has also been noted for Hup, a Nadahup (Maku´ ) language spoken in the multiethnic Vaupe´s region at the Colombian Brazilian border (Epps 2005: 247). Throughout her grammar, Epps points out the importance of gesture to disambiguate or specify information expressed by language (for instance, with numerals or with spatial deictics, e.g., to indicate a body part, the height, or size of an entity).
A different kind of pointing gesture, adding temporal information to verb phrases, has been observed by Floyd (in prep.) for Nheengatu´. This Tupi-Guaranian language, a descendant of Tupinamba´ which in colonial times had developed into a lingua franca throughout Brazil, is still spoken natively by members of different ethnic origin in some places along the Rio Negro in the state of Amazonas in Northwest Brazil. According to Floyd these gestures, which can be performed by hands and eye gaze or by eye gaze alone, are in several respects unlike other co-speech gestures and rather resemble signs used in sign languages. Their frame of reference is constituted by absolute sun-positions along an east-west axis, i.e., their indexical properties are constrained. Such an absolute frame of reference was first observed by Haviland (1993) among the Guugu Yimithirr of Australia. These gestures in Nheengatu´ are highly conventionalized and context-independent. In comparison to Nheengatu´ temporal adverbs for the time of day, they are semantically more fine-grained, making distinctions which are more or less equivalent to the hours of the day. Thus they do not convey redundant information. Floyd further shows that they are internally complex: by pointing to specific positions punctual events and by a sweeping movement between two positions durative events can be expressed. In this respect the gestures also combine or interact with the lexical semantics of the verbs they co-occur with (cf. Floyd in prep.: 20, Fig. 3). Floyd proposes an analysis of this language across modalities, i.e., to treat the Nheengatu´ gestures like the conventionalized grammatical elements of spoken or signed languages. According to the author, such gestures are “fully grammatical within the visual mode” and “can be readily characterized in morphosyntactic terms” (Floyd in prep.: 5) as either elements of predicate modifiers, when occurring in combination with spoken deictics or adverbials, or as modifiers of predicates on their own (Floyd in prep.: 16, Tab. 1). Floyd assumes that over time the more independent gestures have lost their spoken deictic component. He also observes that gestures produced together with a temporal adverbial are less tightly bound to their associated speech, whereas when

1184

VI. Gestures across cultures

occurring by themselves as verb modifiers their temporal meaning is fully expressed without any spoken support. Floyd (in prep.: 5) argues that “since gesture can become increasingly abstract and conventionalized through grammaticalization processes in signed languages, it is unclear why the same would not be possible for co-speech gesture”. From his observations of Nheengatu´ temporal gestures he concludes that they represent a counterexample to the idea that gestures do not grammaticalize as long as there is a spoken channel available in communication and postulates a multimodal approach for descriptive grammars in order to check whether this also applies to other languages (Floyd in prep.: 23).
Pointing gestures also play a crucial role in the study carried out by Nu´ n˜ ez and Sweetser (2006) among speakers of Aymara. The authors investigated the spatial conceptualization of time in this language by analyzing linguistic and gestural data complementarily. The analysis is based on ethnographic interviews, i.e., data which was not recorded in an experimental setting especially designed for the purpose of investigation.
As a starting point for their analysis Nu´ n˜ ez and Sweetser proposed a taxonomy of spatial metaphorical mappings of time which focuses on reference points. While in most other research time is conceptualized in terms of motion in space, i.e., moving-Ego as opposed to moving-time metaphors, in their conceptualization a primary distinction is drawn between time-reference-point and Ego-reference-point structures (see section 2.2 in Nu´ n˜ ez and Sweetser [2006] for details; see also Cooperrider, Sweetser, and Nu´ n˜ ez [this volume]). They found out that in Aymara a static time model is predominant which localizes future events behind and past events in front of Ego. According to the authors, this mapping pattern of time onto space differs remarkably from dynamic Ego-referencepoint patterns shared by most other languages documented so far which conceptualize future and past in the reverse order and where time is most typically metaphorically conceived in terms of relative motion in linear space. The authors argue that co-speech gestures are an additional source of information where linguistic data alone cannot resolve questions regarding the cognitive processing of certain concepts as reflected in metaphors. Metaphoric speech has been observed to be often accompanied by metaphoric gesture. This kind of co-speech gesturing is less conscious and monitored than language and thus provides the researchers with a unique opportunity to visualize the cognitive processing (cf. Nu´ n˜ ez and Sweetser 2006: 403).
In Aymara nouns meaning “front” and “back” can be used to refer to the past or to the future respectively, as illustrated in examples (1) and (2) (see Nu´ n˜ ez and Sweetser 2006: 415Ϫ417):

(1) nayra mara eye/sight/front year ‘last year’

(2) qhipa pacha back/behind time ‘future time’

Unlike patterns in English and other languages, however, the dominant pattern in Aymara does not overtly mark a reference point in order to indicate whether an event occurred before or after another event or whether the event lies in the past or in the future of the Ego. In order to obtain convergent evidence for one time model or the other, the authors

78. Gestures in South American indigenous cultures

1185

interviewed 30 Aymara men and women between 38 and 84 in two regions in the Andes highlands of northern Chile. These were either monolinguals or bilingual Aymara and Spanish speakers with varying degrees of proficiency in the two languages. This factor had a clear impact on the gestural performance, since the ten Aymara monolinguals or bilinguals with no grammatical Spanish made the gestures to be expected from the Aymara linguistic data: when referring to the past they pointed in front of them, and when referring to the future they pointed behind themselves. Of the five fluent speakers of Spanish only one gestured like the Aymara-dominant speakers while the other four showed a reverse pattern, corresponding to the Spanish metaphors for time reference. Other speakers whose proficiency in either language was in-between these extremes gestured into both directions for future as well as past, but here, too, the respective dominant language had a major influence on the gestured time concept. A related factor was the age of the speaker which determined whether s/he had been exposed to formal education in the national language or not. The Aymara gestures also confirmed that in the dominant time model a static Ego in most cases was taken as the reference point: whenever speakers referred to two events in the past they pointed to a more distant location in front of them to indicate that the event was further in the past than another one which they located nearer to themselves (cf. Nu´n˜ez and Sweetser 2006: 430, 431). By pointing in an upward angle to the front, Aymara speakers further expressed that a reference event lies further in the past than events located by low pointing. Sweeping movements, similar to Floyd’s observations in Nheengatu´ , in Aymara, too, indicate periods of time.
In order to account for the deviant model in Aymara, Nu´ n˜ ez and Sweetser (2006: 403) suggest that the temporal metaphor system of this language encodes “aspects of humans’ basic embodied experience of the environment” which are different from those encoded in other languages. The Aymaras’ static mapping of future onto the space behind and past onto the space in front of the person are interpreted by Nu´ n˜ ez and Sweetser (2006: 440) as indicating a strong emphasis on visual perception as a source of knowledge in Aymara culture, i.e., what is known (the past) is in front of Ego, what is unknown (the past) is in the back. Linguistically this further correlates with an evidential system in which the source of knowledge of a reported information, whether obtained by eye-sight or not, is obligatorily marked. A question which arises in this context and should be further explored in future studies is why the same mapping pattern does not occur in other languages with visual evidential systems.

3. Ideophones as vocal gestures
Ideophones all over the world have often been associated with gesture. A close relation between African ideophones and gesture had been pointed out early in Samarin’s (1971) review of studies on various Bantu languages and Kunene’s (1978) study on the Bantu language Southern Sotho. McGregor (2002: 335) refers to ideophones as “vocal gestures” to account for their demonstrative use in Australian languages. Nuckolls (2001: 277), in the context of her investigation of these elements in Pastaza Quechua oral narratives, has termed them as “verbal gestures”, “hybrid forms combining properties from what are traditionally circumscribed as verbal and gestural domains”.
Ideophones can be broadly defined as “marked words that depict sensory imagery” (Dingemanse 2011: 1). This definition contains all important characteristics of ideophones across languages: They are words with specifiable meanings which are marked

1186

VI. Gestures across cultures

in various ways, e.g., in being uttered with marked prosody or in having sound-symbolic properties and expressive morphology such as reduplication. They further depict rather than describe perceptually salient features of events. Ideophones can refer to complex events by themselves, and they can be integrated in discourse. The most common means to integrate them is by means of “quotative indexes”, according to Güldemann (2008: 275), words functioning as markers of direct reported discourse and as predicators for certain invariant elements such as ideophones and “representational gesture”. Such gestures, according to Güldemann (2008: 278), refer to “the represented world [and] are so salient vis-a`-vis speech that they must be viewed as the major meaning-bearing units”. Both, ideophones and this type of iconic gesture, Güldemann more generally subsumes under the term of “mimetic signs”.
Ideophones have been mentioned and partially described for many South American indigenous languages where they are part of the verbal arts and occur most notably in oral narrative discourse (see Reiter [2012: 9Ϫ43] for an overview). A detailed semantic description of ideophones in Pastaza Quechua, taking into account their semiotic distinctiveness, is given by Nuckolls (1996). Nuckolls describes and schematizes the ideophones in this Quechua variety of the Ecuadorian lowlands as subentries of specific “image schemata” in the sense used by Lakoff (1987) and Johnson (1987: 19) as “embodied patterns of meaningfully organized experience”.
One of the uses of ideophones, according to Nuckolls, is to restate a verb meaning as a kind of verbal gesture. In order to account for this, Nuckolls (2001: 277) refers to Kita’s (1997) two-dimensional semantic framework. According to this theory, ideophones are different from other words in that their meanings are primarily represented in what Kita calls an “affecto-imagistic” dimension where they can be directly experienced, similar to the meanings of iconic gestures. In an utterance of the type given in example (3) the ideophone thus depicts the same activity which is referred to by the finite verb, in this case the ideophone ling, describing any act of insertion into an enclosed space, in relation to the verb satina (‘insert’) (cf. Nuckolls 2001: 278, 11):

(3) Chi washa-ga l ing ling ling ling ling ling sati -sha -ga nina-ta hapi-chi -nau-ra.

that back-top ideo

insert-coref- fire-acc catch-caus-3pl-

top

pst

‘After that, inserting (the peppers) ling ling ling ling ling ling, they lit the fire.’

Nuckolls further notes various degrees of abstraction for ideophones in Pastaza Quechua which can undergo semantic changes comparable to those of grammaticalizing forms. She illustrates these with the ideophone tak which can have punctual and completive uses (see Nuckolls [2001: 280Ϫ282] for the whole “paradigm”) . This ideophone has the concrete meaning of a contact between two surfaces, accompanied by an audible sound. In a different context it can depict a soundless contact between surfaces. Further it can be used in contexts where the notion of direct contact has disappeared, as illustrated in (4) (cf. Nuckolls 2001: 281, 14).

(4) Na kay-bi-ga dziriri dziriri dziriri dziriri dziriri tak chupa-ta hawa-y.

new here-loc-top ideo

ideo tail-acc above-loc

‘Then here (the snake coiled itself) dziriri dziriri dziriri dziriri dziriri and (placed)

its tail tak above.’

78. Gestures in South American indigenous cultures

1187

Finally tak can be transferred from one-dimensional contact into three-dimensional space, expressing a contact that surrounds or fills up. This is illustrated in (5) (cf. Nuckolls 2001: 282, 16).

(5) Tak kipiri-kpi-ga? ideo hug-swrf-top ‘And what if he hugged you tak?’

According to Nuckolls (2001: 282), in these contexts tak implies a grammatical notion of completive aspect.
A study of ideophones which does not only describe their phonological, morphosyntactic, and semantic properties but also explores their close relation to co-speech gestures is presented in Reiter (2012) for Awet´ı, a Tupian language spoken by a small indigenous community in Central Brazil. In order to be able to draw any general conclusions from the heterogenous Awet´ı corpus data about how ideophones and gesture interact in communication, identical and similar ideophones as well as those occurring in comparable syntactic and discourse contexts were chosen, described together with their accompanying gestures, and contrasted with each other. The gesture studies are based on more than four hours of non-elicited ethnographic discourse (myths, personal and historical narratives, descriptions, explanations) recorded on video.
The analysis of the available data suggests that ideophones in Awet´ı are consistently accompanied by gesture and that this does not apply to other words (e.g., verbs or nouns) where gestures co-occur less systematically and to a much lesser degree. Furthermore, Awet´ı ideophones and gestures are completely synchronous in that the gesture stroke always falls on the ideophone. Such a noticeable correlation was first described by Kita (1997: 392) with respect to Japanese adverbial ideophones. Kita, who investigated in the interaction between ideophones, spontaneous iconic co-speech gestures and expressive prosody, could further show that the prosodic peak, if existent in an utterance, also falls together with the utterance of the ideophone, an observation for which corroborative evidence could be found in Awet´ı (cf. Reiter 2012: 302Ϫ308).
Regarding the shape of the accompanying gesture, a distinction had to be drawn between ideophones depicting the manner component in motion events, typically occurring in syntactic structures like (6) where their meaning combines with that of a verbal predicate (cf. Reiter 2012: 338, 4), and ideophones expressing other activities, as illustrated in (7), where both (nominalized) verb and ideophone refer to the same activity (cf. Reiter 2012: 430, 10).

(6) Powowowo, o-to a’yn.

1188

VI. Gestures across cultures

The semantic difference between these two types is also reflected in the co-occurring gestures: while the former are accompanied by deictic gestures, only occasionally containing descriptive components, the latter are entirely iconic in nature.
Gestures co-occurring with ideophones of this type further vary, depending on the discourse prominence of the event depicted by the ideophone (cf. Reiter 2012: 450Ϫ451, Tab. 14) or on the degree of an ideophone’s syntactic integration. The latter was the result of the analysis of the gestures accompanying a full “paradigm”, given by various occurrences of the ideophone pupupu (‘boiling’), and of a formally related verb pupure with the same meaning (cf. Reiter 2012: 422Ϫ432). The occurrences, ranging from independent ideophones over different types of their syntactic integration to lexical verbs, showed that with an increase of grammatical structure there was a decrease in iconicity, of the gesture as well as of the ideophone itself which was gradually losing its marked prosody. This suggests that ideophones can indeed be considered some kind of hybrid phenomenon between iconic sign and arbitrary language.
In motion events, ideophones depict the “manner” component, while the co-occurring gestures encode the “path” component. This path information conveyed by gesture depends on the path which is lexically encoded in the motion verb of an adjacent clause associated with the ideophone or by other means, e.g., by a locative adjunct. While most motion verbs in Awet´ı encode the motion and the path component of a motion event and provide information on the figure by grammatical structure, an ideophone encodes motion, manner, and information on the figure. Both, ideophones and lexical verbs, can refer to a motion event by themselves or in combination, occurring in adjacent clauses. Since gestures synchronizing with ideophones depicting motion events always encode a path which is not encoded in the ideophone, they vary with the respective verb or other elements they relate to. If the manner component, depicted by the ideophone, is a central piece of information in discourse, it can additionally be depicted by the co-occurring gesture (cf. Reiter 2012: 433Ϫ452; Reiter 2013).
Gestures accompanying other ideophones than those of motion events depict salient features of the activity referred to, whereas gestures, produced together with verbs referring to the same activities, often depict objects, i.e., participants of the event referred to.
Finally, it could be shown that ideophone-accompanying gestures in Awet´ı are mostly conventionalized and this apparently not only in narrative discourse, where they may be part of a learned repertoire of narrative techniques.
Examples from Awet´ı confirm that gesture and speech are interrelated with regard to ideophones but that the type and shape of the gesture co-occurring with an ideophone also seems to be determined by other factors. Consequently, the multi-modality of any specific ideophone does not, in principle, include gesture as an invariant component. A certain autonomy of the meaning-bearing types of gesture is also pointed out in Güldemann’s (2008: 277) mimesis approach, according to which ideophones and representational gestures are both “mimetic signs” of semantic representation, which Ϫ due to the fact that they are produced by different mediums (speech organs, body) Ϫ can but need not occur simultaneously. In Awet´ı discourse other elements of speech are also gestured but not as systematically as ideophones. Verbs of motion, for example, are most often accompanied by a gesture, while verbs of other semantic classes are only occasionally gestured. Participants, when introduced in the discourse, are often gesturally depicted in size, height, width, or shape. Other gestures seem to have the function of highlighting the intonation structure of the utterance. Furthermore, speakers vary with regard to the

78. Gestures in South American indigenous cultures

1189

frequency of gesture production. Another noteworthy observation is that co-speech gestures are abundantly used in narrative discourse. As a possible explanation it was suggested that gestures serve the story-tellers as a technique of memorizing long narratives.

4. A non-verbal mode o communication in a multilingual setting?
A profitable area for further exploring gesture production in discourse is the Upper Xingu in the southern region of the Parque Ind´ıgena do Xingu, since 1961 the first national reserve in Mato Grosso/Central Brazil. Since the beginnings of Portuguese colonization, the area has been continuously inhabited by different ethnic groups speaking mutually unintelligible languages of various major families. These groups soon established a common cultural system characterized by ceremonial cooperation, intermarriage, and economic interdependencies coupled with a specific language policy which keeps the languages Ϫ seen as the primary badge of an ethnic identity Ϫ apart on an individual level. In accordance with this policy, a person is only allowed to speak the language of the village s/he grew up in and Ϫ if different Ϫ the language(s) of his/her parents. Of immediately surrounding languages, i.e., the language of the other-ethnic spouse and/or the village one moved to as an adult, the person usually has a passive competence.
According to archeological findings and oral history Arawak-speaking groups had founded the cultural system, were joined by Carib-speaking groups from about 1400 onward and in the mid 18th century by Tupian peoples (cf. Franchetto 2000: 117; Heckenberger 2000). Currently, there are still ten languages spoken in the Upper Xinguan society. Although even today ethnic groups from other places are relocated in adjacent areas within the reserve, they are not integrated in the common cultural system.
Already Karl von den Steinen, a German explorer and first visitor to the Upper Xingu in the late 19th century, characterized the discourse of the Baka¨ır´ı Ϫ a Carib people now living outside the area Ϫ as multimodal, describing phenomena such as prosodic markedness, reduplication, ideophones, lip pointing, and hand gestures (cf. Steinen 1894: 70Ϫ72). He further claimed that the gestures used among the Baka¨ır´ı were conventionalized, since exactly the same gestures occurred in his encounters with all other ethnic groups in the area: “Ich darf wohl gleich erwähnen, dass sich die Mimik der Baka¨ır´ı mutatis mutandis mit mehr oder weniger Temperament bei allen Stämmen wiederholte, dass nur die Interjektionen verschieden, die Geberden aber genau dieselben waren” (Steinen 1894: 71) [I should mention right away that the facial expressions of the Baka¨ır´ı were repeated mutatis mutandis in more or less lively manner in all other ethnic groups, that only interjections were different, the gestures, however, were exactly the same.] (my translation). Steinen’s following description of a “stone axe pantomime” performed by the Baka¨ır´ı (1894: 71) suggests that most of the “interjections” he mentions are “ideophones” according to the above definition.
Steinen (1894: 71Ϫ72) also observed that these gestures were not only used in interaction with him as an outsider but also in interethnic communication with the neighboring groups: “Sie waren sparsamer mit diesen Lauten und Geberden in ihrer eigenen Unterhaltung, allein sie verfügten doch über die Hülfssprache ausdrucksvoller Bewegung in reichem Masse und bedienten sich ihrer im Verkehr mit anderen Stämmen […]”, [They were more economical with these sounds and gestures in their own conversation, but they had a large repertoire of this auxiliary language of expressive movements and used it in their interaction with other tribes] (my translation). This suggests that in the multi-

VI. Gestures across cultures

ethnic and multilingual Upper Xingu area there may have existed or still exists a common gestural code which at that time may even have had the function of a lingua franca, similar to the sign language used among the indigenous peoples of the Great Plains in North America. In the Great Plains, European colonialism had triggered the development of this non-verbal lingua franca. The basic conditions for its formation and its gestural manifestations were, however, very different from those in the Upper Xingu. The indigenous groups of the Great Plains had been in sparse contact with each other until horses were (re-)introduced to the area in the late 15th century with European colonialism. According to Taylor (1996) “trade may have been an important stimulus in the development of sign language, and it was certainly an important factor in its diffusion after the rise of horse nomadism” (see also www.handtalkbook.com for several accounts in sign language). While the Great Plains lingua franca was a fully-fledged sign language, Steinen described the Upper Xingu non-verbal code as conventionalized, but still iconic and not too abstract to be understood by outsiders.
That gesture, among other non-verbal modalities, plays an important role in this area where individuals are usually allowed to speak only the language of their ethnic group and where Portuguese only in recent times has started to establish as a modern lingua franca, has been observed by different authors (e.g., Basso 1973, 2009; Franchetto 2000; Reiter 2010; Seki 2011). Basso (1973: 8) attributed the fact that none of the indigenous languages established as a lingua franca to the fact that each of them represents a symbol of group identity. She distinguished between “personal” and “non-personal situations” of interethnic communication. In the former, bilinguals play an important role to convey information from one ethnic group to another, in the latter, formal encounters and on intertribal ceremonial occasions, however, non-verbal codes dominate. These can be gestures, performances of activities as well as body paint designs, and ornamentation. The gestures in these contexts are described as extremely ritualized and appear in a fixed order, i.e., they cannot be combined in a different way to convey other information (cf. Basso 1973: 6Ϫ8).
The development of a common gestural code, however, may also have been of importance in interpersonal relationships. Due to intermarriage every Upper Xinguan village has inhabitants who do not speak the language of their direct environment. During their marriage they become passive bilinguals, as do their spouses, each understanding the other one’s language and speaking one’s own, while their children, entitled to speak the languages of both parents, develop into fluent bilinguals. The role of gesture in the verbal interactions of these interethnic couples has not been studied yet. One may, however, hypothesize that one function of the iconic co-speech gesture, which occurs especially often in story-telling, is to make family-members from other ethnic groups participate in the event, giving them the opportunity to recognize a myth or historical narrative that forms part of a common oral literature.
A comparison of the gestures and their use by professional story-tellers from different ethnic groups belonging to the Upper Xinguan society would be a starting point to investigate in a cultural technique which is currently on the verge of disappearing. For ideophones, on the other hand, it has been noted that they have started to assimilate in the languages of the Upper Xingu, even though their different origins are still known in the speech communities (cf. Reiter 2012: 460Ϫ461, Tab. 5.3).

5. Prospects
As could be shown by this short overview, the study of gestures in South American indigenous languages is still in its beginning stages. The recently growing interest seems

78. Gestures in South American indigenous cultures

1191

to be a direct consequence of the large documentation corpora which have been assembled since the late 1990s. These corpora for the first time include a relevant proportion of video data which turn the attention to multimodality, including the non-verbal cues in communication, and which due to refined recording methods provide material for gesture analysis (cf. Floyd’s in prep.: 23 critical remarks regarding his own incapability to perceive the meaningfulness of temporal gestures due to a bias of attention on audio data and elicitation). In addition, for many previously undescribed languages there are now at least concise grammars available which give those researchers who focus on gesture analysis the opportunity to approach the linguistic data. It should be added, however, that in order to be able to fully understand the gesture use in the discourse of an Amerindian language it is necessary to have access to a reasonable amount of ethnographic information which can often only be provided if the researcher has actually spent some time within the respective linguistic community and closely cooperates with community members familiar with the gesture conventions.
While the interest in this non-verbal mode of communication is growing among researchers of South American indigenous languages, at the same time it can be observed that gesture production decreases or changes with proceeding acculturation and a growing proficiency of the native speakers in a national language. Many of the native languages of South America continue to be highly endangered, even though various countries currently invest in bilingual education programs for their indigenous population.
That the dominant language has an impact on conceptualization of time and its expression by speech-accompanying gestures could be demonstrated by Nu´ n˜ ez and Sweetser (2006: 442) who conclude their study with a pessimistic observation: “Sadly, this rare pattern of linguistic and cognitive construal may be vanishing (at least from northern Chile), thus diminishing the rich cultural diversity of our world”.
Other data from large documentation corpora impressively show that those speakers who make abundant use of ideophones and gestures in their discourse are mostly the ones with little access to formal education, often older members of the communities (cf. various South-American documentation corpora [e.g., Kuikuro, Awet´ı, Cashinahua] under http://dobes.mpi.nl/projects. Examples for the use of co-speech gestures and ideophones are an older woman’s explanation of how to collect honey in the Kuikuro-corpus and various myths told by professional story-tellers in the Awet´ı and older community members in the Cashinahua corpus.) Such tendencies for literacy to “remove[s] language from the body of the speaker” (Nuckolls 1996: 134) have been reported from many different places. In some communities there are still professional story-tellers who learn to use non-verbal cues as part of their artistic repertoire in order to animate their performances. These formerly widespread manifestations of indigenous verbal arts are often not passed on to the younger generations, losing importance vis-a`-vis television and other media technology of Western culture (cf. England 2009: 207Ϫ208). For these reasons oral narratives have been focused on by many documentation projects. In addition, in order to capture what is still left of the native cultures, including the use of nonverbal communicative techniques, initiatives have been set up to encourage younger community members to document their elders on video. One such initiative is the NGO v´ıdeo nas aldeias (‘video in the villages’) (http://www.videonasaldeias.org.br) in Brazil, funded by UNESCO and the Norwegian Embassy. Hopefully, these endeavors will help to preserve unique manifestations of rich cultural practices which in pre-industrial times may also have played a major role in the communication of Western societies.

Abstract
This chapter examines spatial gestures among speakers of the Ancash Quechua language. In addition to a summary of findings from a study of 115 spatial gestures made with hand and head, the value of a phenomenological approach to gesture is presented. Such a perspective is particularly valuable in the study of gestures that refer to the surrounding landscape.

VI. Gestures across cultures

By looking at patterns across communicative and non-communicative practices and habits, it is possible to gain a better understanding of gesture’s role in the emergence, maintenance, transmission, and evolution of local ways of relating to and thinking about the surrounding world. This chapter examines one such pattern: the relations among the relative sequence of gaze and manual gesture, the characteristics of Huaripampa’s landscape, and local ways of wayfinding and orientation. Specifically, the normative sequence of gaze-then-hand correlates with the use of the landscape as a cue for orientation and mnemonic for the locations of places and paths. Further, the gaze-then-hand sequence is shown to facilitate the “handling” of the earth’s physical forms in iconic gestures. In conclusion, these facts suggest that rather than embodying the landscape, this procedure for engaging manually with space involves disembodying the always-already embodied world through gazes and points.

1. Introduction: Geographic, ethnographic, and linguistic context o study
This chapter draws on a study of spatial gestures among Quechua speakers in the Peruvian highland town of Huaripampa (pop. approx. 1,200), located in the department of Ancash, 20km south and 500meters up from the departmental capital, Huaraz. The population of Huaripampa and the closely related smaller communities of Canray Grande and Canray Chico are dedicated primarily to agricultural and pastoral work. However, migratory labor also forms an important sector of the economy Ϫ many residents spend anywhere from one to twenty years working in Huaraz, Lima, or other cities. While in Huaripampa, locals farm areas extending from the town center roughly 1.5km west, 2km north, 0.3km south, and 5km east, and ranging from 3,400meters to 3,800meters above sea level. Further, residents take animals to pasture within this range and to nearby Ruric Canyon. The canyon’s entrance is roughly 14km north-by-northeast from the town center. It extends 7km further from 4,000 to 4,400meters above sea level. Huaripampa and Canray Grande occupy two plateaus separated by the Sawan River. This territory is marked by roughly a dozen smaller mountains and surrounded by glacier-capped mountains, the tallest of which is Huantsan (6,369meters). One goal of this chapter is to argue the relevance of the social and geological configuration of this territory for understanding the particularities of Huaripampa Quechua speakers’ gestures.
I have conducted ethnographic and linguistic fieldwork in Huaripampa periodically from 2010 to 2013. This chapter draws from a set of 115 gestures transcribed from 70minutes of video recorded at five locations with seven participants. I also draw on observations and notes from previous fieldwork. The transcribed gestures are coded for location of recording, hand shape, orientation of gesture and gaze, orientation of movement in gesture and gaze, angle of pointing gestures, torso movements, relative sequence of co-occurring gazes and gestures, referent of gestures, accuracy of pointing gestures, and origo transposition.
The Ancash Quechua language (Adelaar 2004; Julca Guerrero 2009; Parker 1976) is an agglutinative SOV language with extensive derivational morphology (Larsen 2008) and a complex aspectual system (Hintz 2011). The department of Ancash has one of the densest populations of Quechua speakers, with the most extensive dialectal variation. Most relevant to the article here is the way that Quechua speakers in Huaripampa talk about spatial relations. While there are in theory words for left and right, these are rarely used, if ever. The same is true for cardinal directions. My research suggests that the

terms denoting “up” and “down” are used to speak about east and west, respectively. Ambivalent cases are also frequent, because in the case of larger distances, east generally is up, and west down. The words for up and down are part of a paradigm of fourteen nouns that denote directions (Tab. 79.1) and intrinsic relations such as “inside” and “behind.” Further spatial information can be conveyed by six case suffixes (Tab. 79.2). There are three deictic terms, kay, tsay/hay, and taqay, which I will gloss here roughly as proximal, medial, and distal, respectively. The proximal and medial are also both used frequently for discourse functions. The verbal deictic suffix -mu denotes movement toward the origo when affixed to motion verbs, and at a remove from the origo when affixed to non-motion verbs.
In what follows I argue that a phenomenologically grounded understanding of the relation between language, body, landscape, and culture (see box 1) is essential in explaining the relevance of spatial gestures beyond their own systematicity. The emerging study of gestures in language challenges traditional assumptions about human communication, for example the independence of spoken language as a semiotic modality (e.g., Enfield 2009; Kendon 1980; McNeill 1992). Gesture has also been shown to be significant to the study of cognition (e.g., Cienki and Müller 2008; Kendon 1986; Kita 2003; McNeill 2005). I argue further that gesture is a domain of investigation that can deepen understandings of how populations develop, embody, and transmit locally specific ways of relating to the

VI. Gestures across cultures

box 1
I use culture to refer to the habitual or regular practices that are shared systematically but not homogenously across a population and the resulting patterns of associations of meanings and materials (Bourdieu 1977, 1984; Sapir 2002; Silverstein 2004).

environment. In Streeck’s words, “even our habitual motor-patterns are cultural phenomena, while it is the very nature of our bodies to make the acquisition of cultural patterns possible” (2013: 83). I begin with a brief resume of patterns in the data collected. I then discuss how a phenomenological perspective has been brought into the study of gesture, and how it may be relevant particularly in the case of spatial gesture. In the final section I explore this perspective in relation to the sequence of gaze and manual gesture.
2. Summary o data collected
2.1. Hand shapes
Of 115 gestures, 63 were index finger points, 21 were points made with gaze alone, 13 used gestures made with the entire hand, 11 with finger bunches, 3 with thumb points, 2 with closed fists, and 2 with both index and middle fingers. In sum, the majority of hand shapes were index finger points, while the next most frequent case involved no use of the hand, only gaze. There is also a clear correlation in the data that has been noted across diverse languages (Haviland 1993; Wilkins 2003) between the angle of a pointing gesture and the distance of the referent Ϫ in other words pointing higher up indicates a more distant referent.
Ϫ Index finger: 55% Ϫ Gaze only: 18% Ϫ Full hand: 11% Ϫ Finger bunch: 10% Ϫ Thumb: 3% Ϫ Fist: 2% Ϫ Two-fingers: 2%
2.2. Gaze and torso
Of 115 gestures, 81 included a gaze that indicated the referent, 34 involved manual gestures unaccompanied by gaze, and 13 included torso movements. In sum, well over half of the recorded gestures were accompanied by gazes toward the referent.
Ϫ Gaze points (with or without manual gestures): 70% Ϫ Gestures without gaze: 30% Ϫ Torso movements: 11%
2.3. Sequential relation o gaze and manual gesture
Of 115 gestures, the sequence of gaze and manual gesture in the preparation and hold phases was measured in 32 cases and in the retraction phase in 29 cases.

79. Gestures in native South America: Ancash Quechua

1197

In the preparation phase, 25 out of 32 gestures involved the gaze moving toward the target before the hand, while the hand moved first in only 2 cases. In 5 cases the preparation involved the simultaneous movement of head and hand.
Ϫ Gaze first: 78% Ϫ Hand first: 6% Ϫ Simultaneous: 16%

In the hold phase, 29 out of 32 cases involved the gaze reaching the held position before the hand, while the hand arrived first in only one case. In two cases, both head and hand reached the target position simultaneously.
Ϫ Gaze first: 91% Ϫ Hand first: 3% Ϫ Simultaneous: 6%

In the release phase, 18 out of 29 cases involved the gaze moving away from held position before the hand, while only 5 cases involved the hand moving away first. In six cases, the release was simultaneous.
Ϫ Gaze first: 62% Ϫ Hand first: 17% Ϫ Simultaneous: 21%

Finally, in three cases, gaze and hand moved completely separately. That is to say, the retraction of one ended before the preparation of the other began. In all three cases, the manual gesture began after the gaze. In sum, in all gesture phases, gaze consistently occurred prior to manual movement.

2.4. Co-occurrence with deictic utterance
Of 115 gestures, 51 co-occurred with speech including deictic elements. Of these, 24 were proximal, 14 distal, 9 medial, and 7 included the verbal deictic. In sum, slightly less than half of the recorded gestures co-occurred with deictic speech, and of these, proximal forms were most common.
Ϫ Deictic-gesture co-occurrences: 43% Ϫ Proximal: 47% Ϫ Distal: 28% Ϫ Medial: 18% Ϫ Verbal: 14%

2.5. Co-occurrence with spatial case su ixes
Of 115 gestures, 54 co-occurred with speech marked with case suffixes that conveyed spatial meaning. Of these, 22 were “through/about”, 15 were locatives, 11 were goal, 4 were ablative, and 2 were accusative. In sum, nearly half of the gestures co-occurred with spatial case suffixes. Of these, -pa (‘through/about’) was by far the most common.

1198

VI. Gestures across cultures

Spatial case suffix co-occurrences: 47% -pa (GEN): 41% -chaw (LOC): 28% -man (GOAL): 20% -pita (ABL): 7% -ta (ACC): 4%

2.6. Co-occurrence with utterances conveying motion or location
Of 115 gestures, 70 co-occurred with utterances conveying information about location only, 35 co-occurred with utterances conveying information about movement (many of which also implied location information), and 10 were ambivalent.

Ϫ Location: 61% Ϫ Movement: 30% Ϫ Ambivalent: 9%

The ambivalent cases all involved the conjunction of a noun with the suffix -pa, but without a verb. Because this suffix can denote both a path “through,” “about,” or “via,” as well as location in a general proximity, it must be clarified by the surrounding discourse. In four cases, the surrounding discourse suggested movement, and in two cases location. A further case involved the “fictive movement” (Streeck 2009: 136) of the path of a road. Finally, three cases involved true ambivalence: the utterance could be interpreted as both a path toward a place as well as the location of that place. This is because the suffix -pa can function to anchor the vector of the path toward the target to a landmark and/or to locate the target in the general proximity of a landmark (Weber 1996: 286). The following utterance illustrates this point:

(1) Taqay washa -pa Waraqayuq Distal same.level-gen Waraqayuq ‘Waraqayuq is around over yonder’ or ‘Waraqayuq is through over yonder’

During this utterance, the speaker also makes an index-finger pointing gesture accompanied by a gaze in the same direction. The arm is fully extended to the speaker’s right side. It is lifted at an angle of 50 degrees from the horizon, and the index finger is bent slightly to point behind the speaker’s back, suggesting a vector to the northeast. Just before pronouncing the name of the place described, Waraqayuq, the speaker slightly lifts both torso and arm slightly, then brings them down with the first syllable of the word so that the pointing hand comes to rest at an angle of 30 degrees from the horizon. Both the movement and first held phase can be interpreted in a way consistent with the meaning of -pa: the downward movement metaphorically indicates the proximity of Waraqayuq to the general area indicated by the first, higher point, while the first held phase of the point, co-occurring with washa-pa, indicates the path. The second held phase, co-occurring with Waraqayuq indicates the precise location.

1199

2.7. Origo transposition, gesture accuracy, and rames o re erence
Of 115 gestures, 18 involved utterances with a transposed origo (see box 2), 91 involved utterances with origos consistent with the place of the speech event, and 6 were indeterminate. All non-transposed pointing gestures toward physical referents were spatially accurate to within approximately 10 degrees of error. Of the 18 gestures that involved speech with transposed origos, there were four clear cases in which the points involved absolute orientation. In other words, the point could only indicate the referent if the origo was imagined to be at a location specified in the interaction rather than the place of interaction itself. In other cases no determination could be made for one of the following reasons:
(i) I was unfamiliar with the location of the referent, (ii) the gesture indicated only a direction, and thus didn’t involve a transposition of the
origo, or (iii) the referent, origo, and location of interaction formed a straight line such that there
would be no distinction between a transposed and non-transposed gesture.

It is critical to note that speakers never produced points in a relative frame of reference in cases of transposed origos. In sum, speakers clearly can and do produce transposed gestures, and in doing so likely utilize an absolute frame-of-reference. Nevertheless, there is also a strong preference for non-transposed gestures. This may be related to the argument in section 4 that Ancash Quechua speakers’ gestural habits reflect their reliance on looking at the landscape for orientation and wayfinding, but I hesitate to make any conclusion without more extensive data.
Ϫ Non-transposed gestures: 79% Ϫ Transposed gestures: 16% Ϫ Gestures with indeterminate transposition: 5%

box 2
The origo is the source for interpreting deictic meaning (Bühler 1982) or, more generally, the ground of any indexical reference (Hanks 1990: 38). As Le Guen (2011) showed, frames of reference are only involved in pointing gestures in which the origo is other than the location of the speech event (transposed pointing gestures).

3. Body and world: The phenomenological approach to gesture
It would be in some sense absurd to leave the body out of an account of gesture, as has been shown by researchers who have argued for its experiential basis (e.g., Kendon 2004; Müller 1998; Streeck 2009). Such phenomenologically informed work has shown that gestures originate in physical practices and lived experiences and have meaning by virtue of their contiguity with them. It is by virtue of having experienced typing on a keyboard that I can communicate my plan to go write to another by waving my fingers in the air in front of me. But can a phenomenological approach to gesture do more than simply show that gestures mean through indexical links to experience? Specifically, I ask why

1200

VI. Gestures across cultures

we should stop with the body. Drawing on Ingold’s critique of the concept of materiality, Streeck wrote that gestures should be understood “as the work of those who inhabit or dwell in the world” (Streeck 2009: 83). So why exclude the world in which the body dwells? With the typing gesture, while the manual sign refers iconically to its referent in a classic Peircean sense, it does so by means of the indexical link between the hand movement Ϫ the sign-vehicle Ϫ and the experience (which serves here as interpretant). However, in the case of communicating about the land, the indexical ties connecting gestures to the experience of being in and moving through the earth are more complex. What indexical links make it possible for the hand to establish an iconic relation to the landscape? No one can pick up a mountain peak or river, nor can anyone manually reproduce the action of walking toward or arriving at these places. Yet gestures are readily used to refer to such places and actions. Just as my waving fingers would be meaningless to you if you don’t share the experience of typing, a silent point in the direction of a house currently out of sight cannot evoke the image of its resident if the knowledge of the house’s location is not shared among interlocutors.
The previous example shows how a simple act of communication requires the coordination of body, geography, language, and social relations. It would of course be possible to analyze such cases in terms of the internal consistencies and patterns of gesture-speech cooccurrence, hand shapes, frames-of-reference, etc. But what can we learn from an approach that attends to patterns not only in communicative practices themselves, but also to how they pattern with non-communicative practices and background knowledge such as social relations, land use, habits of movement through the landscape, and cultural meanings of surrounding places and paths? Such approaches may help not only to understand gesture, but also the role it plays in the emergence, maintenance, transmission, and evolution of local ways of relating to and thinking about the surrounding world. Further, this approach opens questions that pertain to cognition, culture, and language. Does bodily movement play an instrumental role in the process by which particular ways of thinking about space become shared in a population? Is this necessarily contiguous with linguistic factors, or can it overlap with linguistic groups? Might gestures mediate the role of nonverbal practice in language change? Such questions can be fruitfully investigated only by attending to patterns across communicative and non-communicative practices and knowledge. In the following section I examine such a pattern in my data.

4. Look, point, handle: The sequence o manual gesture and gaze
In section 2.3 I described the finding that manual gestures and gaze pattern together in a regular way in spatial gestures. Specifically, manual pointing gestures are regularly preceded by a gaze in the same direction. I interpret this as an indication of a special relation between visual and haptic experience of one’s surroundings. Whether this relation is universal or culturally specific remains to be seen. However, I would suggest the particular relation in the case presented here has to do with a locally salient way of perceiving the surrounding world. In Huaripampa, the landscape is such that the most efficient and effective way of orienting oneself is by looking at the shape of the land. The contours of mountains, slope of the land, and position of the sun all provide important information (see Fig. 79.1). But more than just getting one’s bearings, the shape of the world also serves as a mnemonic for locating distant places. This is strongly attested in my data and in many more hours of observation and recording: speakers’ predominant strategy for

79. Gestures in native South America: Ancash Quechua

1201

Fig. 79.1: Looking east across Huaripampa from one of the five recording locations.
locating distant places is to point out a visible landmark, either verbally or physically, and then use absolute or direct (Danziger 2010) spatial description to place the target in relation to this landmark. Clearly relevant here is the fact that in the vast majority of instances of pointing that involved both head and hand movements, the gaze moved toward, reached, and returned from the target before the hand or finger. This interlocking pattern of gaze and hand suggests that visual experience provides a fundamental basis for making the landscape “graspable” for meaningful manipulation through manual gesture.
Streeck notes that the nature of hands obviates the dichotomy between sign-oriented (creative) and embodiment-oriented (presupposing) theories of meaning because the hands are used for both data gathering and sign-production (2009: 69). While the dichotomy that Streeck mentions is itself questionable Ϫ Merleau-Ponty (1962) essentially argued perception (not “data-gathering”) is itself a creative act Ϫ the observation that the hand is frequently involved both in experiencing and representing the same phenomenon is insightful. But the same is true of gaze. We use eye and head movements on the one hand to locate and follow the movements of others, ourselves, and things in the world, and on the other hand to communicate about these places and paths.
The following example demonstrates how hands are used to “handle” the landscape as well as the role of gaze in this process. An older man from Huaripampa is explaining how fish that come down the river from Pamparahu Lake are killed when the river joins another that is contaminated with poison. I have transcribed gesture/gaze only in the first part of the utterance, as it is the only part relevant here.

Before beginning the utterance, the speaker starts to move his gaze toward the direction of the soon-to-be-mentioned river confluence, a place obscured by the contour of the land from the current location. As the utterance begins, the gaze reaches the target direction just as his hand begins to move toward the same target. On reaching the second word, a distal deictic, the index finger has reached its holding position, which extends through the pronunciation of the Quechua word for river confluence, tinku. Then, the speaker says ‘encuentro’, the Spanish equivalent of tinku, at the same moment quickly changing the shape of his hand. He now extends both index and middle finger. While his arm remains extended along the same vector as before, the new hand-shape completely changes its mode of meaning (McNeill 1992; Mittelberg 2008). The index finger simply indicated that the vector of the finger and arm together pointed toward the referent tinku. The two fingers together, however, represent the physical form of the rivers’ meeting, while still maintaining the vector toward its location. In other words, the hand’s mode of signification shifted from indexical to iconic, while the referent simultaneously shifted from location to physical form. This series of gestures involved an order consistent with the rest of my data. First, the gaze locates the referent, then the pointing hand,

1203

and only after this is it possible for the hand to begin to engage in a semiotic relation to the referent’s physical form.
In conclusion, pointing gestures accompanying Quechua speech in Huaripampa are normatively preceded by a gaze in the same direction. Furthermore, this sequence is itself a prerequisite for engaging semiotically in gesture with the physical form of the land. But beyond telling us about normative practices in gesture, these facts also suggest local residents orient themselves to the world around them by looking at the lay of the land. The fact that gaze often precedes the beginning of the utterance also strongly contributes to this conclusion. However, this gaze is by no means necessary to locate a place. The same sequence of gaze and manual gesture occurs when referents are repeated one after another, and in conjunction with places in plain sight. Speakers surely could point first, and on a small number of occasions they do (this may also be tied to the dynamics of the interaction, which is unfortunately beyond this chapter’s scope). Rather, the gaze-first sequence seems to be habitual rather than instrumental. This further supports the conclusion that the sequence of gaze and manual gesture speaks to the way residents orient themselves in the landscape. Specifically, this sequence reflects the habitual experience of looking around to get one’s bearings, find the attitude of the sun, or pick out landmarks relevant in finding one’s way.
These facts open the question of whether this normative sequence is reflected in the gestural habits of other populations (see box 3). Would we find a difference along the lines of Ingold’s distinction between transport Ϫ movement from point to point Ϫ and wayfaring Ϫ movement along a path (2011: 149)? For example, how would this data compare to the gestural habits of a group of New York subway commuters who are accustomed to moving from stop to stop? Ingold argues that such a group would perceive the path itself as irrelevant, as opposed to “wayfarers” like hunters, for whom the path is an important source of gathering knowledge, as much the goal of travel as the destination itself. An interesting question for further research is whether this distinction bears out in gestural habits. Investigating the phenomenological aspects of gesture is fundamentally a task that crosses disciplinary methodologies, as it ultimately requires studying language, cognition, local geographies, cultural practices, and social relations. As Sheets-Johnstone (2011) wrote, phenomenology should not be taken as a speculative philosophy, but rather as one that can be validated (or invalidated) and that leads to a trans-disciplinary task.

Related research:
Kita (2003) described a gaze-then-point sequence among Tokyo residents in pointing to unseen referents. Kita’s explanation, however, is that this facilitates “the conceptual choice between LEFT and RIGHT” (2003: 325). In this cognition-centered approach, there is little room to explain the same pattern in a population that practices constant dead reckoning and speaks a language that relies predominantly on absolute and intrinsic frames of reference.
Cienki (2005) showed experimental findings that objectifying points or gazes were not used for gestures representing metaphoric images rather than actual physical referents, supporting the possibility that such distancing helps to distinguish the relevance of the referent’s physical existence.

VI. Gestures across cultures

5. Conclusion: Going beyond the body and embodiment
Just as the body and its movements are necessary to knowledge, communication, and life (Ingold 2011; Sheets-Johnstone 2011), the paths, places, things, and materials that course through the world are motives and means for living, communicating, and knowing. Hanks’ (1990) investigation of deixis among Yucatec Maya speakers moved in this direction, engaging Merleau-Ponty’s philosophy to explain the role of the body and its proprioception in the practice of deictic reference. In doing so, he suggested going beyond the philosopher’s notion of sche´ma corporel to what he called ‘the corporeal field’ (1962: 85). This concept was intended to go beyond the body itself by including a space that is contextually and culturally defined, can be inhabited by co-participants in an interaction, and can be transposed (as in the case of a transposed origo) to other locations (1962: 94). The data presented in this chapter draws attention to cases in which the corporeal field expands to include distant parts of the landscape. I have shown that spatial gestures in Ancash Quechua allow for this expansion of the corporeal field by engaging with the world first through vision, then through pointing gestures that direct attention, and finally through gestures that bring the world into close semiotic contact with the body.
If we consider this as a way of embodying representations of the world, what exactly is being embodied? When confronting communication about a wide-ranging territory, the very concept of embodiment becomes problematic, as it re-inscribes the same separation of body and world that the gestural practices I have described aim to overcome by creating the semiotic conditions for handling the earth, even transforming body parts and their movements into places and paths. To return to Merleau-Ponty, if it is particular ways that the body perceives the world that produces the “known” world, embodiment is not the problem since the world is always already embodied. Instead, the problem is how to disembody the world, to objectify it as a target of reference, and to make it semiotically, linguistically, and gesturally manipulable (see box 3). The data presented here represents a strategy for doing just that Ϫ looking and pointing both contribute to the distancing and objectification of knowledge about the landscape so it can then become an object of the semiotic processes of communication.

Abstract
The systematic study of kinesics, gaze, and gestural aspects of communication in Central American cultures is a recent phenomenon, most of it focusing on the Mayan cultures of southern Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize. This article surveys ethnographic observations and research reports on bodily aspects of speaking in three domains: gaze and kinesics in social interaction, indexical pointing in adult and caregiver-child interactions, and co-speech gestures associated with “absolute” (geographically-based) systems of spatial reference. In addition, it reports how the indigenous co-speech gesture repertoire has provided the basis for developing village sign languages in the region. It is argued that studies of the embodied aspects of speech in the Mayan areas of Mexico and Central America have contributed to the typology of gestures and of spatial frames of reference. They have refined our understanding of how spatial frames of reference are invoked, communicated, and switched in conversational interaction and of the importance of co-speech gestures in understanding language use, language acquisition, and the transmission of culture-specific cognitive styles.

gaze and bodily deportment, as well as emblematic or “quotable” gestures which, like words, are conventionalized in particular communities and vary widely (Kita 2009). But some have argued (e.g., McNeill 1992) that iconic gestures are “natural”, directly reflecting thinking. The corresponding assumption is that their meanings are more or less the same across cultures. Yet most gestures are spatial, and if the cognition that drives them varies Ϫ for example, spatial cognition associated with different frames of reference Ϫ then what look like similar gestures might have rather different cognitive representations. This article surveys work in Central America Ϫ broadly construed as the region extending from Mexico to Panama Ϫ that addresses these issues, focusing mainly on the Mayan areas.
There are over 100 named indigenous groups in Mexico and Central America. (The Mexican CDI [National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples] identifies 62 indigenous groups in Mexico. The website www.native-languages.org lists 52 for the rest of Central America.) Some 16 million people identify with these groups, speaking languages from around 20 distinct language stocks. They live in varying degrees of integration with the surrounding dominant culture, although all are subject to its legal and educational systems. In many of these communities the indigenous language is still spoken and a strong sense of identification with the native culture is maintained. Indigenous languages spoken in this area range from the highly endangered Lacandon (with only a few elderly speakers) to Yukatek Maya (with nearly a million speakers).
These indigenous peoples of Mexico and Central America have been the focus of intense linguistic and anthropological study, especially in the past 50 years. As a result there are hundreds of published descriptions of indigenous languages and ethnographic descriptions of their ways of life, culture, and belief systems. Yet what we can distill from these descriptions concerning everyday practices of bodily comportment, kinesics and gesture is very limited. Occasionally a linguistic description reports on associated gestural practices. For instance Zavala (2000: 144) mentions hand-shape gestures associated with measuring the size of non-present objects among the Akatek Maya, and suggests that this non-linguistic classification system, which is even more specific than the linguistic ones, reveals that classification is deeply embedded in Akatek cultural routines. Similar size gestures are among the eleven emblematic gestures among the Tzintzuntzan Tarascans that were documented by Foster (1949: 237); these, he argues, appear to be widespread in Mexico and have no special relationship to Indian identity. Vogt (1969: 239Ϫ240) describes a ubiquitous interactional marker of seniority displayed in a greeting practice among the Tzotzil Maya of Zinacanta´n, where a lower-status man bows before a higherstatus one and is released from the bow by the latter putting the back of his hand on the bower’s head. But in general, the local habits of everyday social interaction are invisible in the reports of linguists and anthropologists who have lived among these cultural groups.
A major exception is linguistic anthropologists, who over the past 50 years have carried out many studies of social interaction among particular indigenous groups. One of the earliest was Sherzer’s 1983 study of the communicative practices of the Kuna of Panama, where he described in detail their practice of “lip pointing” (1983: 169Ϫ176). But the majority of this work is concentrated in the Mayan areas of southeastern Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize, and it is these that are the source of most of what is known about the bodily communicative practices of native groups in naturally-occurring interactions in this part of the world. Here I concentrate on three aspects where the available information for Mayan groups is particularly rich: gaze and kinesics in social interaction, indexical pointing among adults and between caregivers and infants, and co-speech gestures associated with spatial words and spatial descriptions.

2. Bodily aspects o speaking: kinesics and gaze
Kinesic deportment in interaction differs across social groups Ϫ for example, some tolerate much closer physical proximity than others when initiating an encounter or casually interacting. In the Tzeltal Mayan community of Tenejapa in southern Mexico, a person approaching the house of another with the purpose of interacting will initiate interaction from 20 feet or more away, calling greetings to someone who replies invisibly from within the house. The whole interaction may take place from this distance, or, if the visitor is summoned to sit down for sustained interaction, participants tend to arrange themselves at least 6 to 10 feet apart. Adults are comfortable conversing at length from a distance of 20 feet, and only intimates out of view of the public (or children, or drunks) interact with a physical separation of just a foot or two. A norm of physical restraint governs the control of the body in public situations (Brown 1979; see also Tax 1964), which constrains gesture and influences the nature of co-speech bodily communication practices.
The deployment of gaze while interacting also varies across cultural groups. Among the Tzeltal Maya of Tenejapa, adults generally follow a practice of gaze avoidance which predisposes them to arrange themselves side by side rather than face to face while conversing, and to join gaze only intermittently and briefly during interaction. The same applies to the Tzotzil of Zinacantan, where direct eye contact is an index of close friendship (Freeman 1989). In these communities, prolonged mutual gaze and animated gesture is a feature of conflict situations Ϫ e.g., court cases Ϫ which contributes directly to the communication of hostility in these contexts (Brown 1990). The absence of direct gaze in most contexts is associated with a marked tendency for conversationalists to occupy themselves with “displacement activities”, engaging hands and eyes in physical actions like weaving, smoking, or fiddling with objects (Tax 1964).
Brown and Levinson (2005) relate gaze avoidance in Tenejapa to a characteristic of the Tzeltal conversational response system. Rather than utilizing gaze and facial expressions as a resource for rapid communication of response (as, for instance, the Rossel Islanders of Papua New Guinea do), the Tzeltal response system relies on extensive verbal repetition (Brown 1998); this appears to be an areal feature found in many Mesoamerican indigenous communities (Brown, Le Guen, and Sicoli 2010). A comparative study of gaze practices during question-answer sequences in casual interactions in three unrelated cultures (Rossano, Brown, and Levinson 2009) found that the Tzeltal Maya deploy gaze somewhat differently than do speakers in two other cultural contexts Ϫ Italians and Rossel Islanders in Papua New Guinea. The gaze behavior of question-speakers is similar, but Tzeltal question-recipients gaze at their interlocutor much less than do Italians or Rossel Islanders. Tzeltal interactors also showed significantly less mutual gaze in the question-answer context. Equivalently, in all three cultural settings, speakers gaze more during questions initiating repair than in information questions or confirmation requests. But unlike in the other two languages, where recipient gaze seems to be related to doing recipiency, in Tzeltal the absence of recipient gaze was not a good predictor of lack of response to the question. This is not due to the Tzeltal recipients looking at something else specific; rather, they look down or mid distance, displaying different “home positions” for the eyes when not looking at the other’s face. Nonverbal signals of recipiency Ϫ nods, headshakes Ϫ are infrequent (Brown, Le Guen, and Sicoli 2010). The Tzeltal system of verbal recipiency seems built to assume the absence of an expectation of gaze as an indicator of engaged recipiency.

In short, comparative work on gaze practices shows that the deployment of gaze in interaction is systematic and interactionally managed, but not entirely in the same ways across cultures. Mesoamerica cultures appear in general to be relatively guarded in physical expressiveness and mutual gaze, prompting the hypothesis that this interactional restraint derives from earlier Mesoamerican cultures which were more hierarchically organized than are those of the present day populations.

3. Co-speech gestures
The two types of co-speech gesture that have been investigated in depth in indigenous Central America are connected with spatial reference: pointing gestures and spatially iconic gestures.
Deictic gestures of pointing at things in the environment, and the “presentational deixis” of the linguistic accompaniments to handing objects to others, are contexts where language and gesture are inseparably carrying the message. Hanks’ (1990) detailed study of deictics in Yukatek Maya language use emphasizes deixis as a “referential practice” involving conceptualized bodily spaces not only of a speaker but for some deictic terms of the speech scene including other participants; what is embodied in this case is not a property of an individual but of interacting multiple bodies. Hanks’ work demonstrates the many complex ways in which body spaces are involved in deictic usage.
The most thorough study of gesture in naturally-occurring conversations for this region is Haviland’s work on the Zinacantec Tzotzil. Like Hanks, Haviland emphasizes the nature of pointing as part of the linguistic system of determiners and pronouns (2003: 139). Pointing in Zinacanta´n is morphologically complex, distinguishing reference to individuals from mere direction Ϫ using the index finger for individual referents located in a particular direction vs. a flat hand (palm held vertically, thumb up) for vectors or directions. Other body parts (chin, lips, eyes), as well as objects held in the hand (tools) may be used to point with. Different aspects of a gesture’s form relate to direction, shape, and proximity of the referent. These are not, Haviland argues, simple referring devices, but they are complex semantic portmanteaux analogous to spoken demonstratives (Haviland 2003: 162).
The deictic gestures of caretakers with their infants are also well documented in the Mayan area (de Leo´ n 1998, 2011 and Haviland 1998, 2000 for Tzotzil; Brown 2011 and Liszkowski et al. 2011 for Tzeltal; Le Guen 2011a for Yukatek). Adults and child caretakers index-finger point for infants, drawing their attention to things that will attract them (e.g., birds, chickens) and warning against things that they should be trained to fear (strangers, dogs). In Tenejapa they do so regularly from the time the child is about 10 months old, and, despite a comparatively low level of infant-caregiver interaction during the first 10 months, Tenejapan Tzeltal babies index-finger point at objects, drawing an interlocutor into joint attention towards them, at about the same time as babies in other cultures where interaction with infants is more intensive (Brown 2011; Liszkowski et al. 2011), suggesting a universal basis for pointing. Gestural routines between infants and their caregivers (e.g., holding out and withholding an object) develop well before the baby produces words, and caregivers interpret infants’ gestures as having referential and speech act (e.g., imperative) significance. Infants’ first words are produced in routines combined with gestures in ways familiar from the study of infantcaregiver interactions in other societies (de Leo´ n 1998; Haviland 2005).

VI. Gestures across cultures

The most extensive work on bodily aspects of communication in this region has to do with co-speech gestures associated with spatial reference. Here a phenomenon identified in connection with spatial language has prompted extensive investigation into the co-speech gestures associated with talk about spatial locations. The phenomenon is “absolute” frames of reference, which are a feature of spatial language in many communities throughout the Maya region. When locating an object in relation to another, speakers can take different perspectives, choosing from among three distinct frames of reference (Levinson 2003): they can use an axis projected from the speaker’s own viewpoint (a “relative” or “egocentric” frame of reference as in “to the left of the tree”), an axis projected from the reference object (an “intrinsic” frame of reference, as in “at the front of the car”), or an axis utilizing vectors extrinsic to the scene (an “absolute” or “geocentric” frame of reference, as in “north of the church”). In the Mayan area, spatial language and thinking relies heavily on geocentric frames of reference, and this goes along with a remarkable tendency to gesturally represent direction of motion using an absolute frame of reference and to correctly orient pointing and spatial-relating gestures in relation to their real-world referents’ locations (Levinson 2003).
Haviland (2000), Levinson (2003), and Le Guen (2006, 2009, 2011a, 2011b) have described in detail how the pointing gestures of different Mayan groups conventionally use “correct” geographic orientation for what is being pointed out, even when it is far away and out of sight. Locations and events that involve directional vectors are pointed to with precisely oriented gestures, and characteristics of the terrain and the relative location of objects are gesturally indicated. Haviland’s example (2003: 149Ϫ150) of a man describing the location of some trees in a woodland some distance away shows how complex spatial configurations are conveyed with gestures accompanying a general verbal spatial description (“down”, “below”, “above”): an absolute pointing gesture (toward the actual location of the woodland) is accompanied with iconic indications of the terrain (fingers wiggling), the location of particular trees (a backhand sweep in a directionally accurate direction “above” a different group of trees), and the spatial configuration of objects there. Such descriptions can make use of transposition Ϫ where the speakers transpose their perspective to another location and gesture absolutely from there Ϫ requiring interlocutors to imagine themselves transposed to that location in order to interpret the gestures (Haviland 1996, 2000). Haviland’s work illustrates the semiotic complexity of pointing gestures, distinguishing the local spaces anchored in Mayan contexts to geography from interactional space which is free from geographic reality; narrated spaces are laminated over these (2000: 36).
Absolute gestures are found in utterances both with and without accompanying cardinal direction words. Le Guen’s work on Yukatek Maya (2006, 2009, 2011a, 2011b) shows how even when speakers are not sure where the cardinal directions are, they point accurately to places and maintain an absolutely oriented mental map of their territory. The results of a series of experiments comparing knowledge of the semantics of spatial terms, performance on nonlinguistic tasks and gestures produced by men and women, show striking gender differences in the knowledge of the semantics of spatial terms but an equal preference for a geocentric frame of reference in nonverbal tasks. Le Guen’s conclusion is that the preferred frame of reference in Yukatek Maya is only detectable through the analysis of co-speech gesture and not through speech alone. The reliable spatial accuracy of gestures accompanying speech is likely an important element promoting children’s acquisition of the absolute spatial reference system (Brown and Levinson 2000, 2009; Le Guen 2011a).

Preferred spatial frame of reference has also been shown to influence gesturing on the lateral axis. Kita, Danziger, and Stolz (2001) and Danziger (2008) report that the Mopan Maya of Belize and the Yukatek Maya of Mexico have different preferred frames of reference Ϫ Mopan uses only intrinsic frames whereas Yukatek uses both relative and absolute frames as well. The Mopan pattern of habitual language use correlates with an asymmetry in the conceptualization of space Ϫ the Mopan treat the two sides of a represented body symmetrically, displaying insensitivity to mirror-image reversals. Analogously, in their gesturing, to-the-right and to-the-left relations do not play a contrastive role. When telling traditional mythical stories, the Mopan Ϫ in line with an absence of a linguistic distinction between left and right and no relative frame of reference in Mopan Ϫ do not use the lateral axis contrastively, whereas the Yukatek Maya do. In their gestures representing contrasting aspects of motion (e.g., source vs. goal) and location (e.g., two different entities located in distinct places) the Mopan tended to use sagittally differentiated gestures while the Yukatek used the lateral axis to distinguish them. This distinction extended to gestural representations of time, which in this data for the Mopan were sagitally represented but for the Yukatek were aligned on the lateral axis. Kita, Danziger, and Stolz (2001) argue that this difference in gesturing is not just a thinking-for-speaking effect, but reflects deeper differences in spatial cognition in these two communities.
Le Guen and Pool Balam (2012) observe that for Yukatek geocentric coders, metaphorical pointing for time (e.g., to the back for past) appears to be prohibited. Their explanation is this: since the Yukatek Maya make use of the full range of the gestural space for actual reference to objects in real space, using this geocentric frame of reference presumes that any point in any direction is always by default a reference to an existing direction, or an existing place identified in the speech, or the context. The whole space surrounding the speaker (the gestural space) is relevant for spatial reference and there are only two parts of the surrounding space co-opted for time reference. Although Yukatak Maya speakers do not use a linear metaphorical representation of time, there is still a space-to-time metaphorical mapping. The “now” or “precise/specific” time is indicated by pointing towards the space at the speaker’s feet, i.e., mapped onto the spatial “here”. In accordance with a spatial “up is far/remote” rule, remote time (either past or future) is gestured towards the space above the head of the speaker. Additionally, time unfolding is represented via a cyclical metaphor using a corresponding “rolling” gesture. A contrasting but still nonlinear representation of time in gestures is documented for another Mayan language in a recent dissertation on the co-speech gestures of Chol speakers, where temporal progression is represented not as uni-directional movement along an abstract timeline but as dyadic, non-linear connections between events, often with separate movements in different directions (Rodriguez 2013). Further evidence showing the flexibility of gestural use for time reference despite the predominance of an absolute spatial linguistic system comes from the Tzeltal Maya of Tenejapa (Brown 2012).
A linguistically preferred frame of reference is not a straightjacket; speakers can use more than one to switch perspectives. Danziger’s work (2008, 2010) on spatial language and deictic gestures among the Mopan Maya has motivated her to propose an additional ego-based frame of reference (“direct”) to the standard three (absolute, relative, and intrinsic), which she argues is better able to account for frame of reference usage in cospeech gestures. She analyses a narrative telling, where at one point the speaker shifts linguistically from subjunctive (Irrealis) to completive (Realis) inflexion and correspondingly to a new perspective revealed in gestures, which switch from frontal (in local space)

to lateral absolutely anchored in the geography. Danziger (2008) claims that this is a case of gestural self-repair that “literally makes visible” the narrative’s switch from invoking a virtual non-oriented (Irrealis) space, where gesture occurs in front of the body, to a view of a real place located in relation the speaker’s own body, marked by lateral gestures.
Gestures can metaphorically refer in domains other than that of time. For example, sociocentric pointing Ϫ e.g., pointing to the house of an associated relative to refer to an individual Ϫ is a conventional form of person reference in these Mayan communities (Brown 2007; Haviland 2003, 2007). Pointing to or touching parts of one’s own body while referring to the body part of another in a narration is another example of how speakers transpose gestures to imagined spaces.
Given the large repertoire of conventionalized gestures in the Mesoamerican region, it is perhaps not surprising that indigenous natural sign languages draw upon this repertoire for linguistic signs. Reports of these “village sign systems” are mostly limited to documenting the repertoire of signs in a particular community, along with sociolinguistic observations on attitudes to their use (Du Bois 1978; Fox Tree 2009; Johnson 1991; Schuman 1980; Schuman and Cherry-Shuman 1981). It is argued that these indigenous sign languages are autonomous from the spoken language in the community, and entirely distinct from the sign languages promoted nationally (Mexican Sign Language or LSM in Mexico, Lensegna in Guatemala). There is some evidence of correspondences between the indigenous signs across different communities, widely separated geographically, as well as similarities to hand shape gestures depicted in Mayan hieroglyphs (Du Bois 1978; Fox Tree 2009), suggesting a possible pre-conquest source for these languages.
More detailed on-going work on Yukatek Maya home sign systems in two villages (Le Guen 2011b, 2012) shows that the repertoire of signs developed in these communities is remarkably similar, and draws heavily on the rich repertoire of co-speech emblematic gestures available in the surrounding communicative activities of hearing Yukatek Maya. In particular, Le Guen shows how Yukatek Maya time co-speech gestures have been promoted into time signs in the two villages, and how Yukatek Maya signers have preserved a non-linear metaphorical representation of time inherited from the surrounding culture. The sign language is not restricted to deaf people and their families; most people in the community command the sign language to some degree. Deaf people are therefore not isolated from the main avenues of productivity and interaction available in the community (Le Guen 2011a; see also Danziger 1996; Fox Tree 2009).
In conclusion, studies of the embodied aspects of speech in the Mayan areas of Mexico and Central America have revealed some interesting cultural characteristics of gaze, kinesics, and spatial gestures. They have contributed to the typology of gestures by identifying and characterizing the kinds of gestures that accompany languages where an absolute frame of reference is dominant, in contrast to an intrinsic or relative frame of reference. They have been important in refining our understanding of how spatial frames of reference are invoked, communicated, and switched in conversational interaction. In addition, they have provided evidence for the importance of co-speech gestures in understanding language use and language acquisition, at least in the domain of spatially relevant utterances, and shown the important role of gesture in transmitting culture-specific cognitive styles both across generations and across languages (as in the case of spoken Yucatec Maya and the signed language of deaf Yucatec Mayas). Finally, they have contributed to the increasing ethnographic evidence of the linguistic and sociocultural complexity of communicative gestures and signs, and have added to the theoretical sophistication of discourse taking an embodiment perspective on human communication.

Abstract
Arapaho bimodal talk is the interactional use of language that integrates speech and a large repertoire of conventional gestures. This chapter examines a practice of bimodal talk that uses a two-part grammatical format. Each part of the format features a distinct speechgesture arrangement, with some formal repetition and semantic overlap between the two parts. Speakers employ this format to display their perspective on a social position they are taking. The bimodal properties of the practice allow recipients of the talk to take the speaker perspective, which motivates recipients to display an affiliation with the speaker position. As an important feature of Arapaho language use, bimodal talk provides strong support for the concept of multimodal language.
1. Introduction
[The Arapaho] are known as among the best in gesture speech, and used it to such an extent that, until recently, it was supposed their vocal language was so poor as to make it necessary; in fact, some people had stated that to such a degree were they dependent on signs that they could not carry on a conversation in the dark. (Clark [1885] 1982: 39)
Cursory 19th-century documentation of Arapaho, such as that of William P. Clark (1982) above, suggests that the integration of vocal speech and gesture in Arapaho was well

beyond what Euro-Americans were accustomed to. However, the general disinterest and disavowal of gesture by linguists in the 20th-century means that the most thorough documentation of Arapaho has ignored its multimodal features. This documentation bias has affected other Native American languages with similar multimodal practices (e.g. Farnell 1995). For the Northern Arapaho (Wind River Reservation, Wyoming), a documentary corrective has currently been developed: The “Arapaho Conversational Database” (2011). This video-based interactional corpus provides striking evidence of the multimodal character of Arapaho. Through documentation supported by this corpus, 19th-century discourses of Arapaho as an exotic species of language can be replaced by an understanding of how Arapaho might be exemplary of the general multimodal nature of language.
The idea that language is generally multimodal is a common theme in the work of gesture scholars. Focusing on gesture use in natural interaction, many have challenged the idea that talk, or language in action, is prototypically an exchange of vocal speech. For example, Goodwin (2000: 1519) shows that the action potential of gesture is as diverse as that of speech: Seemingly simple iconic gestures that occur with speech, such as numeric hand shapes, “can carry propositional information and function as individual actions”, while hand points can function “as components of multimodal actions”. To highlight this potential as a matter of information, Enfield (2009) demonstrates the various ways in which gesture can add iconic, indexical, and symbolic content to the information structure of “composite utterances”. Such evidence suggests that speech and gesture are inherently collaborative, and so, as Kendon (2011) argues, language is, at the very least, bimodal.
This chapter supports this claim by presenting evidence from Arapaho that the bimodal interface itself is a semiotic resource rich with action potential. Specifically, the chapter examines a variety of conventional gestures as they are integrated with speech through a special two-part grammatical format. Speakers employ this format as part of an interactional practice for developing a shared perspective. The term bimodal talk is thus used not only to underscore the unique bimodal structure of certain utterances of Arapaho, but also to underscore how these utterances are geared toward social action.

2. Social and historical background
Arapaho is a Native American language of the Great Plains region. The vocal repertoire is polysynthetic and historically situated within the Algonquian language family (see Cowell and Moss Sr. 2008). The repertoire of conventional gestures can be historically situated elsewhere. Arapaho incorporates features of an alternate sign language, which is called Plains Indian Sign Language (PISL) for its primary use as a pre-20th century lingua franca amongst Great Plains tribes (see Davis 2011). Additionally, Arapaho incorporates a pervasive and highly accurate set of local-geographic pointing practices, reflecting a cultural symbolism that is in many other ways highly tuned to the landscape (cf. Anderson 2001). According to Levinson (2003), such pointing practices constitute an “absolute gesture system” and are tied to a cultural specialization in way-finding or navigation. For the Arapaho, absolute pointing practices would have been fundamental for their pre-20th century nomadic lifestyle.
The “Arapaho Conversational Database” (2011) provides evidence that the vocal and gestural repertoires are often integrated in regular talk, as a characteristic feature of Arapaho. Thus, bimodal talk persists despite the long-since loss of Plains Indian Sign Language as a lingua franca, the general decline of traditional geographic knowledge

(Cowell and Moss Sr. 2003), and the general endangered state of the Arapaho language (less than 100 fluent speakers, all over the age of 60). The next sections examine bimodal talk as an activity of ordinary language use.

3. The bimodal ormat and lexical gestures
When Arapaho speakers engage in bimodal talk they integrate conventional gestures and vocal speech. There are many types of conventional gesture and different ways that gesture and speech are integrated. This section examines lexical gestures (a type of “quotable” gesture; see Kendon 1992), and the next section examines other gesture types. Both sections examine how gestures are integrated with speech through a specific grammatical format, the bimodal format.
According to research on other languages, for a typical gesture to impinge on the content of the talk, a speaker must develop a “lexical affiliate” for the gesture by simultaneously positioning it with some segment of vocal speech (e.g. Schegloff 1984). However, because conventional gestures are at least partially symbolic (in the Peircean sense; cf. Enfield 2009) and there is such a variety and quantity of Arapaho conventional gestures, Arapaho gesture and speech can be semantically related in ways that are not dependent on their simultaneous temporal positioning. The bimodal format is exemplary of this unique quality of bimodal talk. By putting the bimodal format into action, speakers bring salient visual detail into collaboration with nuanced verbal detail in order to reinforce, for recipients of the talk, both the speaker’s perspective and the content of the talk itself. The bimodal format is typically employed in situations where a shared perspective is a primary interactional goal.
The bimodal format consists of two components in series, a base and a sequel, which are formally distinct from one another except for some repeated material. In the example below, vocal prefixes are appended to a lexical gesture in the base, while in the sequel the same prefixes are appended to a fully vocalized verb. (Gesture shapes are captured in the stills and lettered; the letters on the top line of the example correspond to still letters; right-angled brackets signify transitions from one gesture shape to the next; gesture and speech are temporally aligned with respect to one another.)
The speaker here has been describing dramatic changes to Arapaho reservation life over the last century. From the speaker’s perspective, the most dramatic period came just after men returned from World War II. The men had returned with a lifestyle that highly contrasted with Arapaho traditions. The speaker uses the base-sequel format to mark this perspective, describing it as a sort of implosion of Arapaho life.
In the base, there is a series of lexical gestures employed in collaboration with vocal elements. Still A shows the hands apart in a gesture that indicates “the Arapaho community”. Still B has the hands coming together for a singular clap that is held for a moment (see Fig. 81.1). Similar gestures are used as standalone expressions for “gun shot” or “explosion” (cf. Clark 1982: 173). Because the gesture in still A depicts the community as a type of bounded space, the gesture in still B conventionally denotes an explosion while simultaneously depicting a collapse of the bounded space that symbolizes the community. Relating the drastic change suffered by the community to an implosion, the gestures thus work together to create a metaphor that could not be realized with the same depth through the idiom of vocal speech (cf. Cienki and Müller 2008). Additionally, the clap comes right before wohei ‘okay’, which as a marker of transition works to reinforce the clap’s metaphorical significance as the moment of implosion.

The final gesture, combining stills C and D, starts with clenched hands that then snap out while the hands move upwards. This gesture indicates “fire” (cf. Clark 1982: 173), which reinforces the “implosion” reading of the prior gesture. The fire gesture is vocally prefixed with an intensifier and ne’ ‘what follows’ to metaphorically qualify the fire as the disastrous result of the implosion. As a coherent statement, the base signifies the metaphorical implosion of the Arapaho community.
The sequel repeats the two vocal prefixes but appends them to the vocalized verb nonsoo-’ ‘confusion-it’, adding that the Arapaho world became very disordered. As the base and sequel components use a repetition of linguistic material to signal conceptual coherence with one another, the total utterance expresses the idea that the implosion of the Arapaho community resulted not so much in the destruction of material life as the destruction of cultural life.
It might seem that instead of a two-part format this example is rather evidence of a word search, where the gesture in the base projects what is finally vocalized in the sequel. However, to be sure, there is no hesitation or extra glottal cut off that would indicate such. Rather, as the example makes evident, speakers employ the bimodal format to bring specific detail to a social position they are taking. Stivers (2008: 31Ϫ32) argues that such detail provides recipients of the talk with “the means to understand what it was like to experience the event being reported through the eyes of the teller”.
For the bimodal format to work in this way, information is distinctly structured from the base to the sequel components. As in the example, the base structure is dominated by gesture. This works to visually detail a speaker’s perspective and thus mark a position the speaker is taking. A gesture-dominated base on its own introduces visual structure into a discourse dominated by verbal structure and thus leaves some amount of interpretative work for recipients. The sequel, then, by being more verbally elaborate makes the dis-

course-sequential connection of the whole bimodal format more explicit, as is the case in the example. Thus, the bimodal format works to maximize both visual and verbal information, making it a crucial speaker resource for detailing a perspective on a social position and thereby providing recipients with the information needed to adopt the perspective.

4. An extended example
A speaker uses the bimodal format to display a social position and give recipients of the talk detailed access to the perspective from which the position was developed. This section shows that through such access, recipients are motivated to display their affiliation with the speaker position. The section examines an interactional example in which the bimodal format encompasses many types of conventional gesture. The situation involves a speaker evaluating the status of a non-Arapaho person who wants to learn the Arapaho language, a culturally sensitive matter. By employing the bimodal format, the speaker motivates recipients to affiliate with his evaluative position.
The three participants in view are sitting in a side-by-side or low eye-contact formation, which is typical of casual Arapaho interactions.

The main speaker, FV, and the two other men, TR and IW, are fluent Arapaho speakers. The woman being referred to, Ann, is working the camera for this video documentation. She is sitting to FV’s right, next to the camera, and out of view. Ann is not a fluent speaker of Arapaho, and so she is not treated as a normal participant.
The culminating action is an associative placement, which is the association of persons through a place. To display a position of support for Ann’s rights to be niibeethinono’eiyeitit ‘one who wants to learn Arapaho’, FV uses the bimodal format to structure an associative placement in which Ann is associated with a well respected person through their place-based life convergence. The example, in its entirety, is given below. (Parentheses enclosing a letter signify a gesture shape that is similar to the lettered gesture without parentheses. Equal signs signify the continuation of a gesture from one gesture line to the next. For other conventions, see section 3.)

The subsections to follow discuss the parts of this example, focusing on how the speaker integrates the conventional gestures and the speech through the bimodal format to develop an evaluative position.
4.1. The evaluative pre ace and a gestural modi ier
In line 1 and still A, FV initiates the sequence by gazing at Ann (see Fig. 81.4). In line 2, FV juxtaposes Ann’s status as a non-Arapaho (nih’oo3ousei ‘white woman’)
and niibeethinono’eiyeitit ‘one who wants to learn Arapaho language’ to preface the evaluation. Still B shows a gestural modifier, which is simultaneous with hinono’eiyeiti

‘to speak Arapaho’. This gesture has a superlative function as it is often used to modify mentions of venerated things or people (cf. Davis 2010: 145). Thus, to display his position that the situation is particularly worthy of evaluation, FV creates a striking asymmetry in the juxtaposition of Ann, a non-Arapaho, and the venerated Arapaho language. Arapaho recipients display their affiliation to such interactional positioning by responding with simple head nods (cf. Stivers 2008), which IW does after FV comes to completion in line 2. Head nods, then, continue to mark key developments of FV’s talk as he defines his evaluative position through the bimodal format.
4.2. The base component, a geographic point, and a gestural link
Next, FV produces a gesture-dominant utterance to instantiate the base component of the bimodal format. The utterance is held together by a geographic point that FV transitions to a person point. The transition constitutes a gestural link, which is a specific bimodal practice of upgrading the status of one of the referents by visually associating it with the other referent. In this case, FV employs a gestural link to construct an associative placement.
To start, FV formulates a setup for the associative placement.

7. IW (head nod)

Fig. 81.5: Lines 4Ϫ7, geographic point to Boulder; TC 4:32

The setup begins in line 4 where FV identifies Ann as a (university) student. From the end of line 4 to line 6 FV conducts a word search for where she goes to school, which is sustained throughout by the geographic point in still C (cf. Schegloff 1984). The point is precisely directed toward Boulder and angled up to indicate distance (about 400 miles).
As the word search culminates in the English place name Boulder, it is evident that FV is using the word search to display an avoidance of an Arapaho-language place name for Boulder. This is because Boulder has two relevant values: First, Boulder is an important area of the Arapaho ancestral homelands; second, Andy, the well respected Arapaho linguist and head of the interactional video documentation project, has the University of Colorado in Boulder as his home institution. The English formulation Boulder indexes the latter, and so the word search works to constitute the geographic point within an attentional frame where the university is the relevant feature of the place indicated (cf. Goodwin 2006). As this particular moment illustrates, places are part of

81. Gestures in native Northern America: Bimodal talk in Arapaho

1223

the rich structure that participants must sequentially develop for semiotic availability. This bimodal formulation of Boulder, then, allows for a subsequent use of the Boulder point in the sequel without any vocal qualifications.
Holding the Boulder point in the beginning of line 8, FV constructs an associative placement by describing Boulder as the place where Ann is from while concurrently redirecting the point toward her (see Fig. 81.6).

Fig. 81.6: Lines 8Ϫ9, gestural link and associative placement; TC 4:42

The gestural link maintains the hand shape throughout and thus ends with a forefinger point at Ann. As Ann is within the participation space, the use of a forefinger to point at her is somewhat marked, a thumb point being normally deployed for such person reference. The forefinger point therefore reinforces the gestural link as a practice for doing something beyond transitioning from one point to another. It is rather a practice in which a speaker takes a position by displaying an association between two referents so that a questionable activity involving one referent can be culturally grounded through the other referent. Here, FV uses a gestural link to culturally ground Ann’s desire to learn Arapaho and thereby upgrade her status. Constructed as an associative placement, the link works by visually detailing Ann’s life convergence with Andy in Boulder, as his research assistant in the language documentation project. Again, such perspectival detail motivates affiliative responses by recipients, such as the head nod in line 9.
4.3. The sequel component, repeated points, and a morphological pointing contrast
After bringing the gesture to rest, FV achieves sequential closure of the evaluation through the sequel. Here, FV is more explicit about the sequential implications of the base’s associative placement. So, while the conceptual coherence of the sequel with the base is signaled by repeating the points to Boulder and Ann, there is no gestural link but rather an increase of vocalized information.
In line 10, FV vocally introduces Andy for the first time (see Fig. 81.7).

The use of the Boulder point in the base is here reinforced by a description of Andy as a teacher of Arapaho language (note that there is no vocalization of place). Additionally, in line 13, FV explicitly states the association between Andy and Ann while pointing at her with his thumb (see Fig. 81.8).

Fig. 81.8: Line 13Ϫ14, repeat of person point but with morphological contrast; TC 4:56
As a thumb point, this gesture occurs in morphological contrast with the prior point to Ann in line 8. Again, doing different work than forefinger points, thumb points generally construe the referred-to person as a part of the participation framework. Given Ann’s ambiguous status as a participant (being a non-speaker but within the participation space), the thumb point works symbolically to highlight FV’s position: Regardless of Ann’s status as a non-Arapaho outsider, she should be treated as a possible interactional participant and, through such acts, encouraged as an Arapaho-language student. The subtle actions of these gestures together with the more explicit verbal descriptions thus work to foreground the significance of the base’s associative placement.
5. Conclusion
This chapter has provided a partial sketch of bimodal talk in Arapaho. A variety of conventional gestures constitute a rich gestural repertoire, including lexical gestures, geographic pointing, and gestural linking. Such gestures were examined through two exam-

1225

ples, both of which highlighted a bimodal format consisting of a base and a sequel component. This format underscores how, in bimodal talk, speakers can build linguistic relationships between gesture and vocal speech that are semiotically rich and conceptually coherent. Additionally, the format is not just a matter of style or artistry. A speaker employs it to articulate and display a detailed social position as well as the perspective through which the position was developed. Detailed access to a perspective allows recipients of the talk to adopt the perspective and thus motivates them to display an affiliation with the speaker’s position. The semiotic richness and action potential of Arapaho bimodal practices demonstrate some of the complex possibilities at the interface between vocal speech and gesture, underscoring the truly multimodal nature of language.

Abstract
A study of gestural articulation in Indian dance theatre using Müller’s (1998: 123, 2009: 514) form-based linguistic analysis exposed processes of conceptualization as each conventionalized hand gesture takes several meanings (Ramesh volume 1). Also, an analysis of pure dance gestures using Laban Movement Analysis revealed underlying spatial relationships and inner connectivity patterns. Based on this a further analysis is presented in this article, where a pure dance gestural movement in the dance style Bharatanatyam is correlated to geometric symbols and signs used in the Indian context. These are abstractions of concepts related to life and are seen in symbols used in religious practices, architectural designs, and works of art. The concepts often find description in terms of physiology of the human body, prompting Vatsyayan (1996, 1997) to describe the body as a metaphor for these concepts. Based on the inherent geometric patterns and subsequent embodied experiences, an additional correlation of gestural movement to image schematic structures discussed in Cognitive Linguistics, exemplifies how the body is not a metaphor but can be understood as the source or basis for conceptualizations represented in the symbols. Pure dance gestures then have the function of reinforcing embodied experiences underlying conceptualizations of life’s phenomena.
1. Introduction
Gesture has been related to thought and imagery and is considered an important constitutive element in the unfolding of these in the dynamics of communication (McNeill 1992, 2005). Gestures expose the mechanisms underlying imagistic processes. As research in co-speech gestures (Kendon 2004; McNeill 1992, 2005; Müller 1998, 2009, 2010) re-

veals, they bring to visualization, or make obtainable, objects, ideas and thoughts, concrete and abstract, and the imagery underlying these. This holds for gestures in the Indian context as well. Used extensively in ritual practices and performing arts, they carry different functions in each. An analysis of gestural articulation of the hands in Indian performing arts based on the mimetic modes of representation proposed by Müller (1998: 123, 2009: 514) has been presented in the article in volume 1 of this Handbook. I have discussed there how each conventionalized hand gesture can take several meanings and briefly described how hands depict objects while the eyes express emotions associated with the object. I also analyzed an example how gestures in pure dance movements called nritta in the dance style Bharatanatyam also establish spatial relationships and inner connectivity patterns. I suggested that a further analysis that reveals crystalline forms in the movements would correlate these to the principles of architecture, the Vastusastra.
In this article I will extend the discussion to how and why the practice of gestural movement in the pure dance context of India seems to underscore inherent geometric structures. Geometric structures and crystalline forms underlie the signs and symbols used in representing the Indian worldview, as some concepts presented in section 2 will reveal. They are seen to give form to the conceptualizations of life’s phenomena and get represented in works of art as geometric shapes, as section 2.1 will briefly present. Their correspondence to the human body and perceptual experiences suggests a grounding of these in embodied experiences. In Section 3 I will therefore first identify, in a pure dance movement, the geometric patterns underlying these symbols, to then correlate these in Section 3.1 to image schematic structures defined in Cognitive Linguistics (the discussion on how these patterns can be related to image schematic structures introduces a further dimension of using linguistic form-based analysis and ushers in a contemporary discussion on gestures used in the Indian context). I finally discuss in section 4 how, due to inherent geometric patterns and embodied experiences arising from spatial relationships and inner connectivity patterns, bodily actions in gestural movement and their correspondence to image schemas reveal an embodied experiential grounding for the geometric concepts related to the Indian worldview.

2. A worldview represented in symbols
The Indian worldview has brought forth a number of geometric symbols and signs, understood as being designed to enable a comprehension of the relationship between man and the universe. These symbols are understood as giving form to the formless aspects of life. Vatsyayan (1997: 11) describes how the organization of the universe is represented by the stambha ‘pillar’. It stands at the center of the earth and represents “perfect balance of the earth and sky” (1997: 10). The idea of movement in the universe has been equated with a wheel and its hub, represented by a circle with a center. The center is the unmanifest, the point of “restful stillness” (1997: 19). Elsewhere she (1996: 51) calls the pillar or pole as growing out of the bija ‘seed’. Space and time get represented in these concepts, extended by the figure of man in a circle to represent man in space and the rhythm of movement, with the cosmic rhythm moving in a spiral. Similarly everything in the universe, including man, is the manifestation of the five elements space, wind, fire, water, and earth. Circle, triangle and square, e.g., represent water, fire and earth respectively.

1228

VI. Gestures across cultures

These shapes also constitute what is called a yantra, a geometric symbol used in religious practices. These geometric patterns are considered to be potent diagrams. The sri cakra, e.g., has a square, within which are several enclosures constituted by 43 triangles, a sixteen-petalled lotus, an 8-petalled lotus, and a central point (Pappu 2008: 15). Each enclosure represents various aspects of life, from emotions to body, mind, intellect, body activities such as digestion or elimination, creation, destruction, the geographic directions, senses, the five elements, and so on. Pappu defines the objective of worshipping this particular symbol as establishing a “oneness” between, “knower, known and knowledge” (2008: 68).
The ancient science of architecture vastusastra mentions shape, orientation, measure, rhythm, and energy as important constitutive elements. Schmieke (2000: 34, 66Ϫ70) explains form as the most basic among these, because the form of an enclosed space defines how energies find orientation, measure and rhythm. The square and its threedimensional form, the cube, are, for instance, seen as the most simple, stable and harmonizing units of space. All the geographic directions get represented here. When space is enclosed in a cube, nature’s forces get organized in it into pulsating spatial pulls corresponding to the geographic directions and forces of nature. These influence man’s physical, emotional and mental well-being and are therefore important when planning construction of buildings. Thus the square and the cube are given great relevance. As seen above, the square builds the fundamental shape of the yantras. The architectural plan of all temples is also designed along these lines (Vatsyayan 1997: 73Ϫ99).
Vatsyayan (1996, 1997) refers in various chapters of her work to how the abstract geometric conceptualizations of life-phenomena are defined in terms of the human body. She sees the body as a metaphor that has been used to explain concepts related to the world. The understanding of the world as pillar is over-layered by the vertical man standing in space. The unmanifest center is equated with the navel. The womb also represents the unmanifest. At the same time, the geometric patterns used for worship represent the human being as a whole as seen above, embedded in the larger framework of factors that constitute and influence life. Also, the important constitutive elements of vastu, namely shape, orientation, measure, rhythm, and energy, are constitutive elements of movement and thus dance as well. The human body here suggests an understanding of the embodied basis of these concepts.
2.1. Geometric representations o a worldview in works o art
The complex relationships of life’s phenomena, understood as geometric patterns and corresponded to the human body, find representations as such through abstractions. The shapes mentioned above are incorporated not only into rituals. Vatsyayan (1997) particularly discusses how geometric shapes of square and circle appear in all forms of representation, be they works of art, temple architecture, or dance movements. Particularly a circle or square, or a circle within a square, with or without figures, is prevalent in art works seen in temples, caves, etc. She (1996: 48Ϫ56) elaborates on how the concept of man and the universe is implicit in the performing arts as well. In the figures she presents (1997: 53Ϫ56, 122Ϫ123) showing dance postures in relation to a circle, its center and diameters, she compares some basic stances of dance forms like Bharatanatyam to these and discusses physiological aspects as well. However, I think a more detailed analysis of the body movement would provide insight into whether the movements only correspond to or represent symbols like the other representations discussed above do, or are

82. Gestures in Southwest India: Dance theater

1229

the very source of such geometric conceptualizations of life’s phenomena. The next two sections will therefore present two distinct forms of analysis as mentioned in the introduction to discuss how geometric patterns in body movement arise intrinsically and correlate both to symbols discussed above and image schemas of Cognitive Linguistics.

3. Gestures and geometry in pure dance nritta
For the following analysis I return to the movement I analyzed in my earlier article (Ramesh volume 1), illustrated in Figure 20.1 therein, to identify the geometric shapes and correlate them to the crystalline forms and geometric shapes that represent concepts of the Indian worldview. The figure is presented below once again as Fig. 82.1 for a better understanding of the analysis. I will draw from a more detailed analysis (Ramesh 2008) and also refer to the earlier analysis in volume 1, in both of which I used Laban Movement Analysis and Bartenieff Fundamentals.
(i) In Fig. 82.1 one sees a deep-seated posture where there is a gradated rotation together with a flexion at the femoral joint and a flexion of the outward turned knees. The feet are placed together with the ankles facing forward. Physiologically this stance or the seatedness of it comes from sitting into the pelvic floor with a firm placement of the feet. This physiological component also is its stabilizing factor, with the extended pelvic floor acting as support. It is the basic stance in dance called the ardhamandala. The geometric shape this is correlated to is the square, with the heels, knees and tailbone in dynamic alignment with each other.
(ii) In the leg gesture coming out of this stance, the right foot is seen to get lifted and placed on the heel on the side at the distance of the stretched leg. In doing so the foot is lifted, tracing a perpendicular triangle. In the final stance called the alidham, one discerns two triangles, if taking into consideration the dynamic alignment between heel and tailbone that constructs an experiential line or trajectory, along which the right foot got lifted vertically before being placed on the side.
(iii) In the gestural movement of the hands, one sees an opening circular motion, ending in a straight line of the arms in a diameter, the scaffolding of a square here. If extending the hands first upwards before going to the sides, one can use the vertical dimension of up-down, thus reflecting verticality of pillar or column. The center experienced here is the navel. It supports the movement.
(iv) There is a tilt of the torso to the side the foot is stretched to. It however retains its verticality along the head-tailbone connection. The vertical alignment along with the navel center is its supporting factor.
(v) The whole movement is along a vertical plane, the final posture taking a Wall Shape. In other words only two dimensions, vertical and horizontal are involved here.
Squares, triangles, lines and circle are the outcome of the stances and movements seen here. The navel center and pelvic center of support that do not move during movement execution give the notion of stillness that is also referred to in the Indian worldview. This one example illustrates how geometric shapes created in gestural movements of Indian performing arts correlate to the same geometric symbols, which are used to represent concepts underlying an Indian worldview. At the same time it also reveals how creating geometric patterns and shapes is inherent to movement of the body. Then body

architecture correlates with space architecture. I would say, movement in space creates shapes. Gestures here do not appear to be a mere representation of the geometric symbols denoting life’s phenomena. They create these geometric patterns through movement and the factors supporting it. The next section will correlate these movements and their geometry with image schematic structures to enable an understanding of how they could be the structuring patterns of embodied experience.
3.1. Image schematic structures in dance movement
Image schemas, according to Cognitive Linguistic Research, structure motor-sensory experiences grounded in motor actions of the body. They are contours of such embodied experiences or recurring patterns of these (Johnson 2005: 15Ϫ34). Several studies in Cognitive Linguistic Research (Hampe 2005) discuss how embodied experiences get

82. Gestures in Southwest India: Dance theater

1231

transformed into mental representations by way of image schematic structures. These structures reflect spatial relationships and geometric patterns and shapes. Mittelberg (2010) has appropriated the shapes gestures reveal, such as a cup-shaped hand to the image schema container (2010: 361), or the hands moving away from each other to source-path-goal (2010: 364), thus providing evidence that the kind of imagery revealed in the geometric shapes and diagrammatic patterns of gestures can be related to the notion of image schemas.
On a similar vein, the cup-shaped shape of the hands seen in the movement pattern in Fig. 82.1 can be related to container, and the outward movement of the hands reflects source-path-goal. There is also verticality in the hand movement, which begins at the chest with an up-down axis as illustrated, going into a side-side axis. This movement also reveals center-periphery, that is moving from center to the distal edges, as I analyzed in the earlier article. The circular movement of the hands creates a cycle. Due to the deep-seatedness, the centerdness at the navel, the vertical alignment, the posture of the legs, and due to the counter-tension provided by the arms and legs as discussed in the earlier article, the movement experience the pattern provides has a balancing, stabilizing and grounding function for the human body. There is thus balance and support. It also reflects containment. The whole posture creates the Shape of a Wall along a Vertical Plane.

4. Gestural movements, geometric patterns, and complex abstract concepts
In this analysis one sees how geometric patterns and shapes that are defined in conjunction with the Indian world view are similar to those executed in the dance movement. Also, they are created by the body through movement, based on its physical structure and its need to balance, on its physiology, and kinesthetic nature. They are thus inherent to movement of the human body. The embodied experience of these movements is also inherent, because of the connectivity patterns (see Hackney 1998 for reference) the movements establish, as discussed in the analysis in volume 1. Geometric patterns, their embodied experience, and inner connectivity patterns hence inform each other. Where there is a geometric pattern, there is an inner connectivity pattern, and thus an experience. The geometric structures of movement provide as such the contours of experience. The image schematic correspondence of the dance movement presented above reveals that these contours of inherent embodied experiences the motor actions provide, also representative of all other movement of pure dance, can be recruited for conceptualization in the same way as discussed in Cognitive Linguistics. They can get recruited here for structuring concepts such as verticality, circle, center, support, enclosure, represented in the geometric symbols discussed in the Indian context. As is evident, the geometry of the movement itself gets conceptualized in the symbols, based on experiential factors.
Damasio (2003) in another body of research postulates how the mind in its creative ability can abstract from mental images emerging due to bodily experiences to symbolically represent objects and events “such as a sign or number” (2003: 204). Symbolic representations as an activity of the mind are thus the outcome of bodily actions and their experience. The mind, in other words, creates the abstractions of its own mental images of motor actions. Damasio sees these experiences grounded in emotions and

1232

VI. Gestures across cultures

feelings, which he calls the substrate for thought and mental abilities (2003: 106, 194Ϫ 196, 204). Such an understanding would also account for the gestural representation of emotions in the Indian context. These then have to be analyzed in further studies.

5. Conclusion
The short exemplary analysis of the gestural representation of geometric patterns that correspond to the symbols in the Indian context enables the conclusion that the body not only represents, but is the basis for symbolic conceptualizations. It exposes how the three-dimensionality of the human body coupled with its ability to orchestrate and integrate gestures of several body parts enables geometric shapes, spatial relationships and inner connectivity patterns intrinsically. These in turn enable embodied experiences from which, as image schematic structures reveal, higher cognitive abilities recruit. The Indian performing arts context in as much reveals how gestures not only represent thought and imagery. They seem to have the function of reinforcing embodied experiences by activating patterns underlying them.

Abstract
People around the world gesture. However, there are cross-cultural differences in their gestures. In this chapter, we focus on the gestures produced by Chinese (Mandarin) speakers and highlight the culturally-specific and universal characteristics of their gestures. Previous research has shown that Chinese adult speakers tend to gesture less often than English adults, possibly because of the influence of Confucianism. Interestingly, an opposite pattern is found among Chinese caregivers who gesture more frequently than American caregivers, suggesting that Chinese and American caregivers might socialize their children in different ways. Besides gesture frequency, Chinese speakers gesture manner and path (semantic components of motion events) differently from English, Turkish, and Japanese speakers. In spite of the aforementioned cross-cultural differences, gestures produced by Mandarin-speaking children show culturally-universal characteristics. In particular, gestures produced by Chinese and American children show sensitivity to discourse-pragmatic features. Moreover, when asked to describe motion events with hands only, the gestures produced by Chinese, English, Turkish, and Spanish speakers display the same syntactic order, suggesting a universal pattern in nonverbal representation of motion events. Future research should be conducted on how bilinguals speaking Chinese and other languages gesture and whether their gestures display the culturally-specific and universal characteristics found in Chinese monolinguals.
1. Introduction
Speakers from all cultural and linguistic backgrounds move their hands and arms when they talk (Feyereisen and de Lannoy 1991; Mead 2009; Wundt 1921); e.g., a speaker points to the right, while saying, “The library is over there”. Such hand and arm move-

VI. Gestures across cultures

ments are referred to as gestures. Interestingly, these gestures are spontaneously created by speakers, who often are not conscious of moving their hands or arms when talking (McNeill 1992).
There are several types of gestures. Iconic gestures bear direct resemblance to the referents they represent, e.g., a speaker flaps his hands when describing a bird; deictic gestures are pointing movements, e.g., a speaker points to a table or point to an abstract space; beats refer to simple and rapid hand movements which come along with the rhythmical pulsation of speech, e.g., a speaker has his index finger flipped outward when he talks; and emblems carry culture-specific meanings, e.g., a speaker has his index and middle fingers formed a V-shape meaning “victory” in some cultures (McNeill 1992).

2. Cross-cultural di erences in gestures
While speakers around the world do gesture, their gestures show cross-cultural differences (see review in Kita 2003). In particular, each cultural group has a distinct set of emblems (Kendon 1992, 2004; Morris et al. 1979; Payrato´ 1993, 2008; Sparhawk 1978). Italy, for example, is, one of the cultural groups that is known for abundant emblematic gestures. For instance, tapping the side of forehead indicates that someone is crazy or index finger tapping the nose indicates that someone is clever. Interestingly, emblematic gestures which have the same forms can carry different meaning across different cultures. For example, the hand waving gesture means “good-bye” in US but it is “come here” in Japan (Archer 1997).
In addition to cross-cultural differences in emblems, there are also cross-cultural differences in gesture frequency. For instance, it is suggested that Italians gesture more often than English speakers (e.g., Barzini 1964) and pay attention to gesture more often when listening than American speakers (Graham and Argyle 1975). Yet, evidence to these claims is always based on research on Western cultures.
2.1. Cultural-speci ic characteristics o gestures produced by Chinese speakers
To date, very few studies have examined the gestures produced by speakers in Asian cultures (e.g., Chinese) and compared these gestures to those produced by speakers in Western cultures. It is possible that Chinese speakers gesture less often than English speakers. This is because Confucianism is the cornerstone of traditional Chinese culture. According to Confucius’ philosophical thinking, one should always be calm, collected, and controlled. Therefore, the body posture should be formal and self-attentive. As a result, it is not uncommon to find that Chinese speakers avoid body movements, including hands, when they are having conversations with others. Otherwise, speakers might be considered to be impolite (Axtell 1993). Given that Chinese speakers tend to be reserved, they might produce fewer gestures to express thoughts and ideas when talking, compared to English speakers. So (2010) examined this issue and found Chinese (Mandarin)-speaking adults seemed to gesture less often than their English-speaking counterparts. In her study, Mandarin- and English-speaking adults were individually shown two cartoons depicting a cat chasing a bird and asked to describe the scenes in their native languages to an experimenter. Her findings showed that the English-speaking adults produced more representational (abstract deictic and iconic gestures) and non-represen-
