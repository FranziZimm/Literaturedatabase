Whither Whorf
Dedre Gentner and Susan Goldin-Meadow
For the last two decades, the hypothesis that language can inﬂuence thought—generally known as the Whorﬁan hypothesis—has been in serious disrepute. Admitting any sympathy for, or even curiosity about, this possibility was tantamount to declaring oneself to be either a simpleton or a lunatic. The view of most language researchers is well expressed by Pinker (1994, 65): ‘‘Most of the experiments have tested banal ‘weak’ versions of the Whorﬁan hypothesis, namely that words can have some effect on memory or categorization. Some of these experiments have actually worked, but that is hardly surprising.’’ Devitt and Sterelny (1987, 178) express this skepticism even more strongly: ‘‘[T]he argument for an important linguistic relativity evaporates under scrutiny. The only respect in which language clearly and obviously does inﬂuence thought turns out to be rather banal: language provides us with most of our concepts.’’ The latter quotation exempliﬁes the rather schizophrenic way in which the Whorﬁan question has been viewed. The language-and-thought question is dismissed as banal and unimportant, yet in the same breath it is stated (almost in passing) that language provides us with most of our concepts—a view far stronger than that of even the most pro-Whorf researchers.
Whorf was not the ﬁrst to express the idea that language inﬂuences thought. For example, Humboldt (1836) viewed language as the formative organ of thought and held that thought and language are inseparable (see Gumperz and Levinson 1996a; Lucy 1996, for reviews). Whorf’s own views were somewhat more subtle than is generally realized. Along with his well-known strong conjecture:

4 Gentner and Goldin-Meadow
We dissect nature along lines laid down by our native language. The categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do not ﬁnd there because they stare every observer in the face; on the contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscope ﬂux of impressions which has to be organized by our minds—and this means largely by the linguistic systems of our minds. (1956, 213)
he also considered weaker views:
My own studies suggest, to me, that language, for all its kingly role, is in some sense a superﬁcial embroidery upon deeper processes of consciousness, which are necessary before any communication, signaling, or symbolism whatsoever can occur . . . (1956, 239)
Nonetheless, the hypothesis that has come to be known as the Whorﬁan hypothesis, or alternatively the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis, states that (1) languages vary in their semantic partitioning of the world; (2) the structure of one’s language inﬂuences the manner in which one perceives and understands the world; (3) therefore, speakers of different languages will perceive the world differently.
Why would anyone ever come up with the hypothesis that the language we speak shapes the thoughts we think? Consider a plausible scenario. When retelling an event, speakers of Turkish are required by their language to indicate whether they themselves actually witnessed that event (Aksu-Koc¸ and Slobin 1986). Of course, the speaker knows whether she witnessed the event. However, she may not be interested in conveying this bit of information to the listener. Speakers of English have the option (which they often exercise) of leaving out whether they actually witnessed the event they are retelling—speakers of Turkish do not. After many years of routinely marking whether they witnessed an event, it is possible that Turkish speakers will tend to encode whether an event has been witnessed, whether or not they are talking. That is, Turkish speakers may habitually attend to this feature of the world much more than English speakers do. In other words, their way of viewing the world may have been altered just by becoming speakers of Turkish as opposed to English. This is the kind of reasoning that underlies the Whorﬁan hypothesis.
This strong Whorﬁan position was widely embraced in the 1950s and 1960s, drawing experimental support from Brown and Lenneberg’s (1954) studies, which showed a positive relation between the codability of

Whither Whorf 5
English color terms (speakers’ agreement on the names of colors) and people’s ability to retain and recognize a given color from an array. The idea was that color terms inﬂuence the way in which people partition the color space, and hence their perception of color, whether or not they are talking. Other work on color within English (e.g., Lantz and Stefﬂre 1964) also seemed to support the hypothesis. But soon afterward Rosch published her inﬂuential paper showing that the Dani people in New Guinea, despite possessing only 2 basic color terms (dark and light), as opposed to 11 in English, nonetheless behaved on cognitive tasks as though their color categories resembled the English system ([Rosch] Heider 1972). Rosch found that the Dani’s similarity groupings accorded better with English basic color terms than with their own linguistic groupings. Further, when asked to learn new categories, the Dani found the task easier when the categories were grouped around English focal colors. The implication was that the perception of color—and which colors are considered focal—is determined by the biology of human color perception and not by the language learned.
These negative ﬁndings ushered in a period of extreme skepticism concerning the possibility of linguistic inﬂuences on thought (e.g., Clark and Clark 1977; Devitt and Sterelny 1987; Pinker 1994). This skeptical view dovetailed nicely with strong zeitgeists in adjoining ﬁelds. In linguistics, the Chomskian emphasis on universals of grammar, coupled with the view that language is a separate system from general cognition and with a de-emphasis of the semantic arena, discouraged any search for a relation between language and cognition. Within cognitive psychology, there was a strong sense that concepts come ﬁrst and that language merely names them: nouns name persons, places, or things; verbs name actions and events; adjectives name modifying concepts; and so on. In cognitive development, the Piagetian inﬂuence favored the same direction of inﬂuence—from thought to language. The dominant position of cognitive psychologists in the last few decades has been that (1) human conceptual structure is relatively constant in its core features across cultures, and (2) conceptual structure and semantic structure are closely coupled. Note that this view allows for no variation in semantic structure across cultures. The same view can be seen in cognitive linguistics, where the coupling between language and cognition has been

6 Gentner and Goldin-Meadow
taken to be strong enough to allow semantic structure to serve as a window on conceptual structure. One lucky implication of this view for cognitive researchers was that the semantic structure of any given language— say, English—could serve as a guide to universal conceptual structure.
Strangely enough, even during this period, when discussions of language and thought were about as respectable as discussions of ﬂying saucers, the position was enjoying a revival in folk theories of politically correct speech. Terms like senior citizens, hearing impaired, and learning disabled were assiduously used instead of terms like old, deaf, and dumb. Interestingly, academicians—even while rejecting the hypothesis in their work—joined others in our culture in behaving as though they believed that language could shape thought. Consider the example of chairman, now replaced by the term chair (suggesting that we, perhaps rather oddly, prefer the risk of confusing a human with an inanimate object over the risk of gender-speciﬁc labeling). Presumably the male-oriented label came about because men were the typical occupants of leadership positions; in this sense, our language reﬂected the state of the world. But why do we think it so important to change the term now? We seem to believe that calling the position chairman potentiates a gender bias, and that calling it chair can subtly change our perceptions so that we will be less likely to assume that the position should be ﬁlled by a male. Insisting upon the word chair seems to reﬂect a folk belief that changing our language can contribute to changing our cognition. Yet despite embracing—or at any rate acquiescing to—this folk belief in their personal behavior, most cognitive researchers continued to ﬁnd the language-and-thought hypothesis unworthy of serious consideration in their professional life.
Recently things have changed. After decades of neglect, the languageand-cognition question has again become an arena of active investigation. Why? At least three themes can be identiﬁed. First was the brilliant work of Talmy, Langacker, Bowerman, and other language researchers who, beginning in the 1970s, analyzed the semantic systems of different languages and demonstrated convincingly that important differences exist in how languages carve up the world. For example, English and Korean offer their speakers very different ways of talking about joining objects. In English, placing a videocassette in its case or an apple in a

Whither Whorf 7
bowl is described as putting one object in another. However, Korean makes a distinction according to the ﬁt between the objects: a videocassette placed in a tight-ﬁtting case is described by the verb kkita, whereas an apple placed in a loose-ﬁtting bowl is described by the verb nehta. Indeed, in Korean, the notion of ﬁt is more important than the notion of containment. Unlike English speakers, who say that the ring is placed on the ﬁnger and that the ﬁnger is placed in the ring, Korean speakers use kkita to describe both situations since both involve a tightﬁtting relation between the objects (Choi and Bowerman 1991).
This evidence of substantial variability in how languages partition the world has profound consequences. It means that at least one—if not both—of the two core assumptions held by cognitive psychologists and linguists is wrong. If semantics varies crosslinguistically, then one cannot maintain that conceptual structure is universal and that semantic structure reﬂects conceptual structure. One could simply adopt the assumption that semantic structure and conceptual structure are independent of one another, leaving the universal view of cognition intact. However, faced with this dichotomy, a number of researchers have taken the alternative route of exploring ways in which semantic structure can inﬂuence conceptual structure.
The second theme developed from a set of theoretical arguments. These include the revival of Vygotsky’s (1962) case for the importance of language in cognitive development, Hunt and Agnoli’s (1991) inﬂuential review paper making the case that language inﬂuences thought by instilling cognitive habits, Miller and Stigler’s (1987) research on crosslinguistic differences in number systems and their inﬂuence on learning arithmetic, and Lucy’s (1994) research on the cognitive effects of classiﬁer grammars.
The third important trend was a shift away from the focus on color to the study of domains such as space, which offer much richer possibilities for cognitive effects. Spatial relations are highly variable crosslinguistically (e.g., Bowerman 1980, 1989, 1996; Brown 1994; Casad and Langacker 1985; Levinson and Brown 1994; Talmy 1975, 1985). This suggests the possibility of corresponding cognitive variability. Further, spatial relational terms provide framing structures for the encoding of events and experience. They play a more interesting cognitive role

8 Gentner and Goldin-Meadow
than color names. Finally, spatial relations, like color concepts, are amenable to objective testing in a more direct way than, say, people’s concepts of justice or causality. The work of Levinson’s group demonstrating cognitive differences that follow from differences in spatial language—speciﬁcally, from the use of absolute spatial terms (analogous to north-south) versus egocentric terms (e.g., right/left/front/back)—has been extremely inﬂuential in attracting renewed interest to the Whorﬁan question, either arguing for the effect (Levinson 1996, 1997; Levinson and Brown 1994; Pederson 1995) or against it (Li and Gleitman 2002). Interestingly, there has continued to be a line of research on color, the beˆte noir of the Whorﬁan hypothesis (Kay and Kempton 1984; Lucy and Shweder 1979). Davidoff, Davies, and Roberson (1999) have recently produced counterevidence to Rosch’s claims, based on a reanalysis of her results and on further work with another New Guinea tribe.
These themes coalesced in 1991 with the Wenner-Gren Foundation Symposium in Jamaica on the topic of rethinking linguistic relativity. Its direct result was an inﬂuential volume edited by Gumperz and Levinson (1996b), and its indirect result was to spark a renewed look at issues of language and thought. One important outcome of this symposium was Slobin’s ‘‘thinking for speaking’’ hypothesis: that language inﬂuences thought when one is thinking with the intent to use language and that this inﬂuence is not at all trivial. Variants of this idea had been considered before; for example, Pinker (1989, 360) states that ‘‘Whorf was surely wrong when he said that one’s language determines how one conceptualizes reality in general. But he was probably correct in a much weaker sense: one’s language does determine how one must conceptualize reality when one has to talk about it.’’ However, Slobin was the ﬁrst to focus closely on the idea of ‘‘thinking for speaking’’ and to delineate its implications. This version is more cautious than the grand view that language determines the way in which we perceive the world; but for that very reason it is more palatable, and perhaps more conducive to empirical testing. Moreover, it invites close consideration of the processes by which speakers link cognition and language. It also spurs related questions, such as whether speaking and comprehending are equivalent in their opportunities for linguistic inﬂuences on thought and whether language inﬂuences thinking when one is talking to oneself (a link with Vygotsky’s inner speech).

Whither Whorf 9
The purpose of this volume is not to settle the question of language and thought—which in any case we suspect is not one question but several—but to make it clear that the question (or questions) are worth asking and to encourage theoretical and empirical research. This time around we come equipped with better analyses of the linguistic distinctions and a better understanding of the relevant psychological processes and methods for testing them. Theories and experiments are being advanced at a rapid pace. A strong sign of the health of this arena, as is clear from the chapters in this volume, is that there are now close debates on speciﬁc issues. Current research continues to ﬁnd mixed results, again as demonstrated in this volume. But the depth and precision of questions has increased dramatically since the early investigations.
The topics dealt with here range broadly; they include space, number, motion, gender, theory of mind, thematic roles, and the nature and function of objects versus substances. There are even two separate chapters that raise the ante on language and cognition enough to be titled ‘‘What Makes Us Smart? Core Knowledge and Natural Language’’ (Spelke) and ‘‘Why We’re So Smart’’ (Gentner). The ﬁelds represented span a broad spectrum of cognitive science: cognitive psychology, cognitive development, linguistics, anthropology, and animal cognition.
To begin, theoretical chapters by Clark, Levinson, and Tomasello introduce the relevant questions from different perspectives. The remaining chapters fall into three broad (and overlapping) categories based on their questions and methods: language as lens, language as tool kit, and language as category maker. The answers are far from uniform.
Under the theme language as lens, the question posed is whether the language we acquire inﬂuences how we see the world. This view is closest to the classical ‘‘Whorﬁan hypothesis’’ that the grammatical structure of a language shapes its speakers’ perception of the world. On the afﬁrmative side, Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips argue that gender assignments, long thought to be purely grammatical, have subtle but pervasive effects on how people think about objects. A more neutral position is taken by Slobin, who argues for limited effects of the semantics of motion verbs on how people talk about—and to some extent how they think about—motion events. On the negative side, Munnich and Landau ﬁnd that distinctions in spatial language do not predict deviations in spatial representation. Also on the negative side, Malt, Sloman,

10 Gentner and Goldin-Meadow
and Gennari tested two possible claims of the language-and-thought hypothesis and found evidence for neither. One was that manner-path differences in the way actions are lexicalized would predict which aspects of events are likely to be retained for later recognition; the other was that nonlinguistic similarity groupings of artifact categories would reﬂect the semantic categories found in different languages.
Under the theme language as tool kit, the question posed is whether the language we acquire augments our capacity for representation and reasoning. This theme harks back to Vygotsky’s view that ‘‘. . . learning to direct one’s own mental processes with the aid of words or signs is an integral part of the process of concept formation’’ (Vygotsky 1962, 59; quoted in Kuczaj, Borys, and Jones 1989). All the authors in this section argue in the afﬁrmative. Gentner suggests that relational language augments the human ability to engage in relational thought. Kuczaj and Hendry argue that teaching symbolic systems to chimpanzees leads to gains in their cognitive abilities. Inagaki and Hatano discuss linguistic and conceptual factors that inﬂuence inductive projection between animals and plants. De Villiers and de Villiers argue that acquiring the ability to use complement clauses fosters the development of theory of mind and thus the ability to pass false-belief tasks. Spelke suggests that language plays a role in providing conceptual links between initially separate modules.
Under the theme language as category maker, the question posed is whether the language we acquire inﬂuences where we make our category distinctions. On the afﬁrmative side, Bowerman and Choi suggest that the acquisition of spatial semantics in a language inﬂuences infants’ early categorization of spatial relations, and Lucy and Gaskins argue for the inﬂuence of classiﬁer typology on the development of nonverbal classiﬁcation. Imai and Mazuka take a more neutral stance, arguing for a limited role for linguistic typology and an important role for universal ontological knowledge on early individuation. Finally, GoldinMeadow ﬁnds evidence for a possible universal starting point—namely, the ergative construction—that all humans may experience before learning language. Goldin-Meadow’s ﬁndings point to thought before language and thus have a non-Whorﬁan feel. But how can the ergative construction be so basic and at the same time be so difﬁcult for speakers

Whither Whorf 11
of nonergative languages to fathom? Perhaps it’s because the nonergative languages that most of us speak have irrevocably altered our ergative starting point and thus, in Whorﬁan fashion, have inﬂuenced how we think.
There are some interesting connections among the views taken here. First, in the language as lens chapters, some authors dismiss language as simply a mediator of cognition, arguing that when parallels between language and thought are found, it is merely because language is used covertly in the task (in other words, the task is really a language task and thus not a good test of the Whorﬁan hypothesis). The chapters in the language as tool kit section take issue with the ‘‘merely’’ in this claim. They suggest that such covert uses are a manifestation of the usefulness of language in the cognitive arsenal. However, both views agree that language is a powerful mediator of cognition when we speak—and much of our lives is spent in language-related activities. We learn not just by direct experience but also by hearing or reading about the state of affairs, so at least in this sense language has the potential to shape our conceptions of the world.
Another contrast is that whereas the language as lens view tends to focus on obligatory elements of language, the language as tool kit view encompasses speciﬁc content words, such as relational terms, and special-purpose constructions such as the complement clause construction. Also, tests of the language as lens hypothesis tend to involve crosslinguistic comparisons; indeed, all of the chapters in this section have taken this tack. In contrast, tests of the language as tool kit hypothesis can also be carried out within a language, by comparing outcomes when different sets of symbolic terms are made available to populations: for example, to primates (Kuczaj and Hendry), to children (Gentner), or to deaf individuals learning language late in life (de Villiers and de Villiers). Tests of the language as category maker view are often crosslinguistic, comparing speakers of languages that draw the boundaries between categories in different places (Bowerman and Choi, Lucy and Gaskins, and Imai and Mazuka). However, it can also be informative to examine populations that have never been exposed to language on the assumption that these populations offer us a pre-language view of thought (GoldinMeadow).

12 Gentner and Goldin-Meadow
Finally, a developmental issue that emerges primarily in the last section of the book is the chicken-and-egg question: which comes ﬁrst, the concept or the linguistic term? Scholars like Bowerman have for some time challenged the long-standing view that concepts come ﬁrst and language merely names them. This question clearly calls for a developmental perspective and, indeed, each of the chapters in the language as category maker section examines categories over developmental time.
In the past, empirical tests of the language-and-thought question have not proven convincing to either side in the debate. We suggest this stalemate has come about, in part, because the language-and-thought question is not one question but many. Whether language has an impact on thought depends, of course, on how we deﬁne language and how we deﬁne thought. But it also depends on what we take to be the criterion for ‘‘having an impact on.’’ Language can act as a lens through which we see the world; it can provide us with tools that enlarge our capabilities; it can help us appreciate groupings in the world that we might not have otherwise grasped. As illustrated in this book, exploring these and other possibilities requires comparisons across languages and domains, as well as comparisons across thinkers who have and have not been exposed to language. From such an agenda, we are unlikely to get a yes-or-no answer to the whole of Whorf’s thesis. But if we have delineated a set of more speciﬁc questions for which the answer is no to some and yes to others, we will have achieved our goal.

Languages and Representations
Eve V. Clark
1.1 Introduction
Although we use language every day to talk about experience, language itself is far from being an exact representation of our experience. When we understand and produce language, we always have to take into account the fact that language does not offer us exact maps of the experiences we may wish to recount to someone or interpret from someone else. As Slobin has pointed out: Language evokes ideas: it does not represent them. Linguistic expression is thus not a straightforward map of consciousness or thought. It is a highly selective and conventionally schematic map. At the heart of language is the tacit assumption that most of the message can be left unsaid, because of mutual understanding (and probably mutual impatience). (1979, 6) Add to this the fact that what is conventionally schematic in one language may not be so in another. Effectively, Slobin here echoes Whorf: Users of markedly different grammars are pointed by their grammars towards different types of observations and different evaluations of externally similar acts of observation. . . . ([1940] 1956, 221) Whorf in turn follows Boas, who pointed out that those elements in a language that are obligatory—the grammatical categories—are what determine ‘‘those aspects of language that must be expressed’’ (1938, 127). In short, what is obligatory in each language can differ, so that speakers only express part of whatever they have in mind (Boas 1911).
What this implies is that speakers will select different details, different aspects, from their representations of each scene or event, depending on what language they are speaking. In some languages, they must always indicate the time of the event being reported relative to the time of

18 Clark
speech; in others, they must attend to internal properties of the event (whether it has been completed or remains incomplete, whether it involves iteration or not, and whether it represents permanent or temporary characteristics); in still others, whether the speaker personally experienced the event being reported or whether the facts and details are known from hearsay; whether the objects and activities being reported are visible to the speaker or not, or whether they are close to the speaker, to the addressee, or to some third person; in still others, they must always attend to the gender of each nominal used to designate a participant in an event. What is obligatory in one language can be entirely absent from another (e.g., gender in German vs. English; aspect in Polish vs. Hebrew; speaker’s source of knowledge—direct or hearsay—in Turkish or Bulgarian vs. Greek or Arabic; and so on).
1.2 Representations for Language
What are the cognitive consequences of all this? Does absence from the grammatical repertoire of a language mean absence from all conceptual representations? The answer to this, I argue, is no. When we represent the actions we do in putting on shoes versus putting on a coat, our representations are likely to be highly similar regardless of whether we speak Japanese (and must therefore choose which of two distinct verbs to use for these two activities) or speak English (and rely on just one verb for both actions). In the same way, if we call to mind a sequence of events, we can typically also call up many details about their relative internal and external timing (sequence, completeness, overlap, unﬁnished elements, etc.) even though there may be no ready way to express these details in our language. But if we are planning to tell someone else about this sequence of events, then we need attend only to those properties of the events that must be encoded in the language we use (Slobin 1996a). The same goes for thinking about versus talking about motion. If we demonstrate an action to someone else, we usually include in our gestures details that mark the manner in which the action was performed, but when we talk about the same episode, we may or may not include information about manner, depending on the language we use (e.g., Slobin 1996b; see also McNeill 1998). This suggests that the nature of the representation we draw on and the details we have to take into ac-

Languages and Representations 19
count will differ with what we are doing—here, for instance, remembering versus recounting.
Do we therefore set up and store multiple representations? Or just a single representation with every possible detail included so we can select whatever it is we need on each occasion when we call up that representation with a particular goal or purpose in mind? But selecting the relevant information from such a representation could take time. Having representations for talking instead could be one factor that streamlines our skill in retrieving and organizing just those grammatical elements we need when we plan and then produce an utterance. And this would imply that we call on other, more elaborated (or simply different) representations for other purposes.
In fact, even for language, we probably draw on multiple representations. First, as we listen to someone speaking, we need to be able to recognize the words and expressions from the acoustic information we perceive. So we need to have the appropriate representations of words stored, for example, so we can identify the same word uttered on different occasions and by different speakers. For production, though, we need instead a detailed set of articulatory directions so we can produce the target words and expressions when we wish to say them ourselves. These representations for understanding versus speaking require that we store very different kinds of information for use in the processes of comprehension versus production (Clark 1993). We need further linguistic representations for the graphemic forms that can be used to represent language. We must represent the visual shapes of letters, for instance, so we can recognize them in different fonts and in different handwritings. And we need representations of the motor programs we rely on in writing those same letters ourselves. The representations needed for language use in a literate society comprise at least these, and maybe more. We clearly include very different kinds of information in our representations for listening versus talking, on the one hand, and for reading versus writing, on the other.
1.3 Representations for Events
How do we represent events? When we say we remember something or that we are thinking about something, what information do we call up?

20 Clark
What about when we categorize some experience without talking about it? Or make a mental comparison between this occasion and another remembered from a long time ago? We can clearly draw on any and all information that we have represented in memory about the relevant events. But do we draw on one single all-purpose representation of each event? Or do we draw just on the representation that we might need for present purposes? Notice that the information we might need about one event in order to compare it to another might not be the same as the information we would need if we planned to talk about that same event, and the information we would need for talking about the event in language A could be different in a variety of ways from what we would need in language B. (And many speakers are multilingual.)
The same event, I suggest, could be represented in a variety of ways in memory. We can store it from the perspective of more than one participant (or even of onlookers); we can include various amounts of detail; and we can connect one or more of these representations to other representations already in memory. This would all suggest that we don’t rely on just one representation of a speciﬁc event for all we do in remembering that event, thinking about it, comparing it to another event, reading about it, or recounting it to someone else. It’s important to keep this in mind because it is all too easy to allude to the representation in memory for event X, when in fact which representation we actually call up on each occasion probably depends very much on whether we are daydreaming, trying to reconstruct some detail, planning to tell someone about a speciﬁc episode, or simply remembering that one episode was very similar to another, remembered from a different occasion. In short, it seems likely that we rely on multiple representations much of the time, and then draw on the one with the relevant amount of detail for the current purpose.
1.4 Perspective and Lexical Choice
Languages differ not only in their grammatical structure and in the precise repertoire of obligatory distinctions speakers must make in each utterance, but also in the range of lexical choices available (just how the lexicon maps onto each conceptual domain) and which range of con-

Languages and Representations 21
ceptual perspectives speakers can therefore make use of. Where a language has terms for four or ﬁve taxonomic levels for plants and animals, for example, speakers will have more options in deciding which level of categorization is the appropriate one when giving speciﬁc instructions, telling a story, or writing a report. Each lexical choice marks the conceptual perspective that the speaker has chosen to take on that referent for that occasion (e.g., Clark 1997; Schober 1998), but speakers of different languages will have different numbers of options available in different domains.
These differences in the lexicon, and in the grammar too, reﬂect some of the historical differences among languages. Each community of speakers has its own history that has helped shape both lexicon and grammar over time. We trace close relations among languages by tracking cognates in their lexicons and by looking at typological patterning in grammatical structures (e.g., Croft 1990; Greenberg 1966). But while differences in grammatical structure require the speakers of each language to take into account somewhat different combinations of grammatical features as they think—and plan—for speaking, these differences affect only what is represented for linguistic expression. Keeping track of details for speaking is not the same as remembering an event, or thinking about connections among certain events. It is only when speakers put something into words that they must encode just those grammatical distinctions that are obligatory for their language, and those, I suggest, are ‘‘given’’ or present because of the habits of thought we develop for each language.
The point is this: If people think for speaking, they must have represented those grammatical distinctions that are obligatory for the language they are using. If instead, they are thinking for understanding what someone said and computing all the implicatures in arriving at an interpretation—versus thinking for remembering, thinking for categorizing, or one of the many other tasks in which we call on the representations we may have of objects and events—then their representations may well include a lot of material not customarily encoded in their language. It seems plausible to assume that such conceptual representations are nearer to being universal than the representations we draw on for speaking.

22 Clark
Where do these conceptual representations come from? They are most likely built up from what infants and young children ﬁnd salient in their early organization of conceptual categories and relations. As a result, languages, or rather their speakers, probably draw quite heavily from the universals of the most general representations in selecting grammatical distinctions to encode. This would explain, for instance, why young children at times try to express distinctions not conventionally made in the language they happen to be being exposed to, distinctions that are made in other languages (see Clark 2001; Clark and Carpenter 1989).
1.5 Some Consequences
What follows from this view of thinking and speaking? First, we should expect to ﬁnd a considerable range from one language to the next in the grammatical distinctions that are obligatory, just as there is a range in what receives lexical encoding in different languages. Speakers of each language come to encode any obligatory distinctions as a matter of course whenever they speak that language. And a major part of acquisition is learning which grammatical details are obligatory. But this doesn’t tell us anything about how being speakers of Hebrew, of Navajo, of Mandarin, or of Spanish will affect how people think about the world at large when they are not using language. That is, distinctions that are encoded grammatically, like aspect or gender, should probably have little or no effect on tasks that have no linguistic basis.
Second, we should ﬁnd that in tasks that require reference to representations in memory that don’t make use of any linguistic expression, people who speak very different languages will respond in similar, or even identical, ways. That is, representations for nonlinguistic purposes may differ very little across cultures or languages. Of course, ﬁnding the appropriate tasks to check on this without any appeal to language may prove difﬁcult. The point is that if we make use of different representations depending on whether we are using our language or not, the fact of being a speaker of a particular language (or languages) cannot be said to limit or restrict how we represent the world around us. It will only shape what we are obliged to include when we talk (Slobin 1996a).

Languages and Representations 23
Overall, this view underlines the need for more precision when we characterize the range of representations we can draw on, the kinds of conceptual and perceptual tasks where we make use of them, and any differences there may be between representations for speaking and those we can draw on for other kinds of cognitive tasks.

Language and Mind: Let’s Get the Issues Straight!
Stephen C. Levinson
2.1 Introduction
Current discourse on the topic of language and mind is at about the intellectual level of a chat show on the merits of democracy. Ideological nonsense, issued by famous scholars, ﬁlls the air, even the scientiﬁc journals. Serious scholars tend to leave well enough alone, since such exchanges reveal a banal underlying lack of analysis. It is as if the topic of ‘‘Whorﬁanism’’ is a domain where anybody can let off steam, go on mental holiday, or pounce upon an ideological enemy. This is a pity, because the issues are deeply relevant to understanding our place in nature, and how we should understand our unique language capacity. Further, the issues are entirely open to careful analysis and empirical investigation, using the normal methods of the linguistic and psychological sciences.
In this chapter, I try to spell out in the simplest terms what the underlying issues are (but see Levinson 1996, 1997a, 2000, 2001, in press, for deeper discussion). We have to establish some kind of sensible mode of discourse before empirical results can be appreciated for what they are. As I outline at the end of the chapter, there is an accumulated body of such results, but ﬁrst we had better try to establish the foundations for rational discourse.
2.2 The Doctrine of Simple Nativism and Its Coevolutionary Alternative
There is a widespread presumption in the cognitive sciences that language is essentially innate. All the other species have innate communication systems, so why not humans too? Of course, languages don’t all

26 Levinson
sound alike, but that’s a matter of superﬁcial clothing. Underneath, it’s the very same ﬂesh and blood. There are two basic tenets to the doctrine. The ﬁrst holds that the syntax of language is fundamentally universal and innate, a view of course associated with Chomsky. The second (of central interest to this chapter) holds that the semantics is given by an innate ‘‘language of thought,’’ a view ably defended by Fodor (1975). Put them together and one has the widespread presumption, which I will dub Simple Nativism, which curiously enough is not generally associated with any adaptational or evolutionary argument for language (see Levinson 2000). The central property of Simple Nativism is the claim that all the major properties of language, the object of study, are dictated by inbuilt mental apparatus. The observable variation is simply ‘‘noise,’’ and nothing much can be learned from it. Protagonists of this view can be found across the cognitive sciences, including linguists like Jackendoff (see Landau and Jackendoff 1993), cognitive psychologists like Pinker (1994) or Gleitman (see, e.g., Li and Gleitman 2002), and the so-called evolutionary psychologists like Tooby and Cosmides (1992).
Despite its prominence, this doctrine is peculiar. First, it is impossible to reconcile with the facts of variation across languages. Second, it is a theory of innate (thus biological) endowment outside biology. There is no biological mechanism that could be responsible for providing us with all the meanings of all possible words in all possible languages—there are only 30,000 genes after all (about the number of the most basic words in just one language), and brain tissue is not functionally speciﬁc at remotely that kind of level. Third, it misses the most fundamental biological specialization of our species: the species has coevolved with culture—we cannot survive without it, but with it we have evolved a method of adapting to new ecological niches with much greater rapidity than our genome.
This last point is worth developing a little further. Human evolution has been shaped by the development of two distinct types of information transfer across generations, genetic and cultural, with systematic interactions between them (Durham 1991). Just look at the evolution of our hands and the progression of the tools to be found in the archaeological record. Language is an obvious central part of this gene-culture coevolution—it is culture, responding to its particular ecological niche,

Language and Mind 27
that provides the bulk of the conceptual packages that are coded in any particular language. The contents of language, and much of its form, are thus largely the products of cultural tradition—but at the same time those cultural elements are constrained in many different ways by the biological nature of the organism, particularly its learning capacity. Rather precise information about this kind of interaction has now been provided by the study of infant speech perception. Infants are highly sensitive to the initial speech sounds around them, and they seem to have an innate ﬁne-grained categorical system of perception shared with monkeys and other mammals. But by six months after birth infants have done something no monkey can do: they have warped this system of categories into line with the local language they are hearing around them. In that short time, they have acquired a cultural acoustic landscape. It is hard to escape the conclusion that human infants are ‘‘built’’ to expect linguistic diversity and have special mechanisms for ‘‘tuning in’’ to the local variety (Kuhl and Meltzoff 1996, 1997). We can expect to ﬁnd exactly the same sort of interaction between prelinguistic perceptual distinctions and linguistically variable semantic distinctions. Thus, Choi et al. (2000; see also McDonough, Choi, and Mandler, in press; Bowerman and Choi, this volume) have shown that 9-month-old infants have equal facility to make, for example, English versus Korean spatial distinctions, while by 18 months they are tuned into the local languagespeciﬁc distinctions. By the time we reach adulthood, just as we ﬁnd alien language distinctions hard to hear, so English-speaking adults have lost the ability to make Korean distinctions even in nonlinguistic implicit categorization. Infants, unlike monkeys, are preadapted for cultural variation, for discovering the local system and specializing in it.
This alternative coevolutionary account, with psychology and cultural variation locked in mutual adaptation, is much better suited than Simple Nativism to understanding linguistic and cultural variation. It makes us think differently about what the biological endowment for language must be like. Instead of expecting that endowment to predict all the interesting properties of observable languages, we need rather to think about it as a learning mechanism wonderfully adapted to discerning the variability of culturally distinctive systems—a mechanism that simultaneously puts limits on the variation that those systems can throw at

28 Levinson
it. On this account, the essential properties of language are divided between two inheritance systems, biological and cultural, and the longterm interactions between them.
Simple Nativism has blocked sensible and informed discussion of the relation between language and thought for decades. Once the facts about linguistic diversity are properly appreciated, it will be clear that Simple Nativism ceases to be of any real interest.
2.3 Linguistic Variation
Simple Nativists hold that linguistic categories are a direct projection of universal concepts that are native to the species:
Knowing a language, then, is knowing how to translate mentalese into strings of words and vice versa. People without a language would still have mentalese, and babies and many nonhuman animals presumably have simpler dialects. (Pinker 1994, 82)
Learning a language is on this view simply a matter of learning the local projection, that is, ﬁnding the local phonetic clothing for the preexisting concepts. Or as Li and Gleitman (2002, 266) put it:
Language has means for making reference to the objects, relations, properties, and events that populate our everyday world. It is possible to suppose that these linguistic categories and structures are more or less straightforward mappings from a preexisting conceptual space, programmed into our biological nature: Humans invent words that label their concepts.
Hence, they hold, ‘‘the grammars and lexicons of all languages are broadly similar.’’
The view just sketched is simply ill informed. There is no sense of ‘‘broad’’ under which ‘‘the grammars and lexicons of all languages are broadly similar.’’ If there were, linguists could produce a huge range of absolute linguistic universals—but they cannot do so. As Greenberg (1986, 14) has put it, either language universals are trivial (‘‘All spoken languages have vowels’’), or they are conditional generalizations with statistical generality. It is fundamentally important to cognitive science that the true range of human language variation is not lost sight of.
It may be useful to review some of the fundamental parameters of variation. Natural languages may or may not be in the vocal-auditory

Language and Mind 29
channel—they can be shifted to the visual-manual one, as in sign languages. When they are broadcast in an acoustic medium, they may have as few as 11 or as many as 141 distinctive sounds or phonemes (Maddieson 1984). Languages may or may not have morphology, that is, inﬂection or derivation. Languages may or may not use constituent structure (as in the familiar tree-diagrams) to encode fundamental grammatical relations (Austin and Bresnan 1996; Levinson 1987). Thus, they may or may not have syntactic constraints on word or phrase order. Languages may or may not make use of such basic word class distinctions as adjective, adverb, or even, arguably, noun and verb (Mithun 1999, 60–67). If they do, the kind of denotation assigned to each may be alien from an English point of view. Languages force quite different sets of conceptual distinctions in almost every sentence: some languages express aspect, others don’t; some have seven tenses, some have none; some force marking of visibility or honoriﬁc status of each noun phrase in a sentence, others don’t; and so on and so forth. Linguists talk so often about universals that nonlinguists may be forgiven for thinking that they have a huge list of absolute universals in the bag; but in fact they have hardly any that have even been tested against all of the 5%–10% of languages for which we have good descriptions. Almost every new language that is studied falsiﬁes some existing generalization—the serious comparative study of languages, and especially their semantic structures, is unfortunately still in its infancy.
I emphasize the range of linguistic variation because that’s the fundamentally interesting thing about language from a comparative point of view. We are the only known species whose communication system is profoundly variable in both form and content (thus setting aside, e.g., minor dialects in bird song form; Hauser 1997, 275–276). So we can’t have the same kind of theory for human communication that we have for bee or even monkey communication; ﬁxed innate schemas are not going to give us a full explanation of language. Of course, the human innate system must be superbly equipped to expect and deal with the variation—and so it is. This is what Kuhl (1991) has so nicely shown in the realm of speech sounds, as noted above: infants, unlike monkeys, are built to specialize early in the local sound-system.

30 Levinson
Let us now pursue the subject of special interest to this chapter: semantic variation across languages. Take the spatial domain. On ﬁrst principles, this is a conceptual domain where we would least expect major semantic variation; after all, every higher animal has to be able to ﬁnd its way home, and mammals share a great many specialized anatomical and neurophysiological systems dedicated to telling them where they are and where things are with respect to them. So if the Fodor, Pinker, or Gleitman story is correct anywhere, it should be so here: spatial categories in language should be direct projections of shared innate conceptual categories. But it turns out that there is not the slightest bit of evidence for this.
We may take a few simple examples of spatial concepts where universal agreement on spatial categories has been expected. Let us start with deixis, often presumed universal in all essentials. It has been supposed that all languages have demonstratives that make at least a contrast between ‘this’ and ‘that’, but even spoken German seems to falsify that (some German dialects arguably have no demonstratives at all, but only articles). And for languages that do have two demonstratives, it turns out that there are at least four semantic types; more generally, research shows almost as many semantic distinctions in demonstratives as languages investigated (Meira and Dunn, in preparation). Likewise, it has been supposed that all languages make a basic distinction between ‘come’ and ‘go’ verbs. But in fact not all languages handle this distinction in lexical verbs (instead, e.g., using ‘hither’, ‘thither’ particles), and, when they do, there is tremendous variation in exactly what is coded. Typically, but not always, ‘go’ has no deictic coding, merely pragmatically contrasting with ‘come’, and the ‘come’ verb may or may not entail arrival at the deictic center, and may or may not allow motion continued beyond this center (Wilkins and Hill 1995).
Next, let us turn to the subdomain of so-called topological spatial relations. These are relations of contact or propinquity (like English on, at, in, near), which, following Piaget and Inhelder (1956), have been taken to be the simplest kind of spatial relation. Landau and Jackendoff (1993) have suggested that closed-class spatial expressions in languages are highly restricted in conceptual type, referring only to ‘‘the very gross geometry of the coarsest level of representation of an object—whether

Language and Mind 31
it is a container or a surface’’ (p. 227). On the basis of English prepositions, they conﬁdently make universal claims of the following sort: no language will have spatial relators expressing speciﬁc volumetric shapes of ground objects—for example, there will be no preposition or closedclass spatial relator sprough meaning ‘through a cigar-shaped object’ (p. 226). But the Californian language Karuk has precisely such a spatial preﬁx, -vara ‘in through a tubular space’ (Mithun 1999, 142)! The whole set of claims is based on woeful ignorance of the crosslinguistic facts.
Still, however rich the rest of the semantic distinctions, it could be that every language encodes a notion precisely like English on and in. Not so: many languages fractionate these notions and indeed have much more speciﬁc notions, like ‘in a hemispherical container’ versus ‘in a cylindrical container’. Tzeltal makes many such distinctions in spatial predicates (Brown 1994). But perhaps we simply need to qualify the claim: if a language encodes spatial relations in prepositions (or postpositions), then every such language encodes a notion precisely like English on or in. This is not remotely true either. In current work, Sergio Meira and I have mapped the adpositions (prepositions or postpositions) of a dozen languages of different stocks onto exactly the same set of 70 spatial scenes, each scene depicting a subtype of a topological relation.1 What emerges quite clearly is that there is no basic agreement on what constitutes an ‘in’ scene, a spatial relation of containment, or any other basic topological relation. It is simply an empirical matter that spatial categories are almost never the same across languages, even when they are as closely related as English and Dutch.
Finally, we have also surveyed a wide sample of languages for the kinds of coordinate systems or frames of reference they use for describing the location of objects widely separated from a reference object (Levinson, in press). In these situations, some kind of angular speciﬁcation on the horizontal plane is called for—as in ‘The ball is behind the tree’. It turns out that although languages vary greatly in the detailed geometry employed, there are three main families of solutions: an egocentric (or more accurately viewpoint-dependent) relative system (as in the ‘The ball is left of the tree’), a geocentric absolute system (as in ‘The ball is north of the tree’), and an object-centered intrinsic system (as in ‘The ball is at the front of the truck’). These three are all polar

32 Levinson
coordinate systems and constitute the best claim for universals in the spatial domain. But there are some important caveats. First, not all languages use all three systems. Rather, they form an inventory from which languages must choose at least one—all combinations are possible, except that a relative system entails an intrinsic system. That means there are languages without words for ‘left’ or ‘right’ directions, but where all spatial directions must be speciﬁed in terms of cardinal directions like ‘east’ (so one has to say things like ‘Pass the northern cup’, ‘There’s a ﬂy on your northern leg’, etc.). Second, as mentioned, the local instantiation of any one system may be of a unique kind. Consider for example relative systems, which if fully developed involve a ‘left’, ‘right’, ‘front’, ‘back’ set of distinctions. Now, these distinctions are very variously mapped. They involve a projection of viewer-centered coordinates onto a landmark object, so that, for example, the ball can be said to be behind the tree. In English, this projection involves a reﬂection of the viewer’s own left-right-front-back coordinates onto (in this case) the tree, so the tree’s front is the side facing us, and its back is the side away from us, but its left and right are on the same side as the viewer’s. In Hausa and many other languages, this projection involves translation, so ‘left’ and ‘right’ remain as in English, but ‘front’ and ‘back’ are reversed (‘The ball is behind the tree’ means it is between the viewer and the tree). In some dialects of Tamil, the projection involves rotation, so ‘front’ and ‘back’ are like in English, but ‘left’ and ‘right’ are reversed. And so on and so forth—there is plenty of semantic variation. Although the choices between different frames of reference are limited, they are quite sufﬁcient to induce the very strongest ‘‘Whorﬁan’’ effects, as described below (and see Levinson 1996; Pederson et al. 1998).
To sum up: the Simple Nativist idea (as voiced by Pinker and Gleitman) that universal concepts are directly mapped onto natural language words and morphemes, so that all a child-learner has to do is ﬁnd the local name as it were, is simply false. There are vanishingly few universal notions, if any, that every language denotes with a simple expression. Even the renowned case of the color words only substantiates this fact: languages vary substantially in the number of color words they have, and what they actually denote (Kay and McDaniel 1978; Kay, Berlin, and Merriﬁeld 1991). A term glossed as ‘red’ may—according to the

Language and Mind 33
standard theory—actually include brown, yellow, and related hues, and ‘black’ may include blue and green. But some languages have at best only incipient color words (Levinson 2000), and this has required substantial weakening of the standard theory (Kay and Mafﬁ 1999). There is really no excuse for continued existence of the myth of a rich set of lexically packaged semantic universals. Removing that myth opens the way for entertaining seriously a heretical idea.
2.4 The Very Thought: Could the Language We Speak Inﬂuence the Way We Think?
There is an ideological overtone to Simple Nativism: the independence of thought from language opens up to us the freedom of will and action (‘‘[S]ince mental life goes on independently of particular languages, concepts of freedom and equality will be thinkable even if they are nameless’’ Pinker 1994, 82). So Whorﬁanism and linguistic determinism have to be impossible! This moral imperative is beside the point, not only because we are not in the preaching business, but also because, despite some incautious language, no one, not even Whorf, ever held that our thought was in the infernal grip of our language. Whorf’s own idea was that certain grammatical patterns, through making obligatory semantic distinctions, might induce corresponding categories in habitual or nonreﬂective thought in just the relevant domains (see Lucy 1992b for careful exposition). Now that idea, generalized also to lexical patterns, seems neither anti-American nor necessarily false. More generally still, it seems fairly self-evident that the language one happens to speak affords, or conversely makes less accessible, certain complex concepts. There are languages with no or very few number words, and without a generative system of numerals—it seems unlikely that the speakers of such a language would ever entertain the notion ‘seventy-three’, let alone that of a logarithm, and certainly their fellows would never know if they did. As mentioned, there are languages that only use cardinal direction terms for spatial directions, where one must constantly be able to unerringly locate the center of a quadrant at, say, 15 degrees east of north—speakers of such languages can be shown to have a developed sense of direction of a different order of magnitude from speakers of languages that lack such

34 Levinson
constant reference to geocentric coordinates (Levinson, in press). If they didn’t have such competence, they couldn’t communicate; the language affords, even requires, certain underlying computations (see section 2.5). In this sort of way, languages can differentially impede, facilitate, or require underlying mental operations.
In this section, I want to show that the web of theoretical commitments we already have in the linguistic and psychological sciences seem to converge on the presumption that speaking speciﬁc languages does indeed have cognitive consequences for the speakers of those languages.
First, take the simple question ‘‘Do we think the same way that we speak?’’ Making various classical assumptions (e.g., accepting the notion of a representation), this question can reasonably be rendered as the more speciﬁc ‘‘Are the representations we use in serious nonlinguistic thinking and reasoning the very same representations that underlie linguistic meanings?’’ The answer, I have shown (Levinson 1997a), has to be no. The reasons are various, but conclusive: semantic representations have to be decoupled from conceptual representations to allow for various properties of linguistic meaning like deixis, anaphora, very limited lexica, linearization, and so on, which are clearly not properties of conceptual representations. Besides, there are many different kinds of conceptual representation, from the imagistic to the propositional. But there are also quite persuasive arguments to the effect that though linguistic and nonlinguistic representations are distinct, there must be at least one level of conceptual representation that is closely aligned to a semantic level; otherwise, we couldn’t transform the one into the other with the facility we have, as shown by the speed of language encoding and comprehension. Further, any semantic distinctions must be supported by the underlying conceptual distinctions and processes that are necessary to compute them (if you have a lexical concept ‘seven’—and not all languages do—you had better be able to count to 7 if you are going to use it correctly). So, overall, that level of conceptual representation is close to, but not identical to, a level of semantic representation.
Our next simple question is, ‘‘Do all humans think alike?’’ Given that there are multiple representation systems (for vision, touch, smell, etc.), many of them specialized to the sensory modalities, and given that many human sensory experiences are basically similar (given the world we all

Language and Mind 35
inhabit), there is no doubt that there is a broad base of ‘‘psychic unity’’ in the species. But we are interested in the more abstract representations in which we think and reason, which are closest to language. We can transform the basic question then into the more speciﬁc ‘‘Is the conceptual representation system closest to semantic representation universal in character?’’ The answer to that question is—perhaps surprisingly— almost certainly no. The answer can be derived from both ﬁrst principles and empirical investigation. Here I concentrate on the reasoning from ﬁrst principles, postponing the empirical arguments to the following section.
Why must the conceptual representations closest to semantic representations be nonuniversal? Because languages vary in their semantic structure, as we saw in section 2.3. Simply put, the fact is that there are few if any lexical concepts that universally occur in all the languages of the world; not all languages have a word (or other expression) for ‘red’ or ‘father’ or ‘in’ or ‘come’ or even ‘if’. Now the consequences of that basic fact are easily enough appreciated. Let us pursue a reductio. We have established that semantic representations map fairly directly, but not exactly, onto the closest level of conceptual representation (CR). Assume now that CR is universal. Then, allowing for some slippage, semantic representations (SR) must be roughly universal too. But they are not. Therefore, we must abandon the assumption that CR is universal.
Approaching the problem from the other direction, we know that languages code different concepts at the lexical level. Now assume—as Fodor and many psychologists do—that corresponding to a lexical item is a single holistic concept (Fodor, Fodor, and Garrett 1975). Further assume, as they do, that SR and CR are coextensive. Then, since we think in CR, users of different languages think differently. So, it follows that ‘‘nondecompositionalists’’ (i.e., those who do not think that lexical concepts decompose into subconcepts) are implicit Whorﬁans—a fact that they do not seem to have appreciated.2
Linguists tend to be decompositionalists—they tend to think that lexical concepts are complex, composed out of atomic concepts. Naturally, they are not always so naive about semantic variation as the psychologists. But they think they can escape the immediate Whorﬁan consequence: languages encode different concepts at the lexical level, but

36 Levinson
they ‘‘compose’’ those semantical concepts from a universal inventory of atomic concepts. Even assuming that SR and CR are closely related, as seems to be the case, it no longer seems to follow that different languages require different conceptual relations, or that speaking a language would induce different ways of thinking: both SR and CR could be universal at the level of conceptual primes or primitives. So we can cook our varied semantic cakes out of the same old universal ﬂour and sugar.
Though I am sympathetic with the decompositional move, it is hardly the intellectual triumph that it may seem. Suppose I hypothesize a universal inventory of 20 or 100 primes, and now I come across a language that has words that won’t decompose into those primes. What will I do? Add to the universal inventory the features we need for that language, of course. So what makes them universal? At least one language uses them! How would you falsify such a theory? There isn’t any way to falsify a theory of universals that consists in an augmentable list of features that any one language may freely select from. It’s the weakest possible kind of theory—it would need to be supplemented with a theory that tells us why just those features and no others are in the inventory, and we are in no position to do that because we have as yet no idea of the real extent of semantic variation.
But there’s another problem with decomposition. Psycholinguistic evidence shows that when words are activated, the concept as a whole is activated, not little bits of it. And the psychologists have compelling evidence that we don’t think at that atomic level—we think at the macrolevel of conceptual wholes, the level reﬂected in lexical concepts. The reasons for this lie partly in properties of short-term memory, the major bottleneck in our computing system. For short-term memory is limited to, say, ﬁve chunks at a time, while not caring a jot about how complex the underlying chunks are—or, put another way, what they can be decomposed into (Miller 1956; Cowan 2001). We don’t have to think about a hundred as ‘ten tens’ when doing mental arithmetic, or aunt as ‘mother’s sister, or father’s sister, or father’s brother’s wife, or mother’s brother’s wife’ when greeting Aunt Mathilda. Composing complex concepts gives enormous power to our mental computations, and most of those complex concepts are inherited from the language we happen to speak. So the linguists are wrong to think that lexical decomposition

Language and Mind 37
will let them off the Whorﬁan hook. Sure, it allows them to hold a remoter level of universal concepts, and it might help to explain how we can learn complex cultural concepts, but the conceptual level closest to the semantic representations, and the level in which we compute, seems likely to be heavily culture speciﬁc.
So, given the facts of semantic variation, and what we know about mental computation, it is hard to escape the conclusion that, yes, the ways we speak—the kinds of concepts lexically or grammatically encoded in a speciﬁc language—are bound to have an effect on the ways we think. And this conclusion is going to be general over all the different kinds of theory scholars are likely to espouse: noncompositional or compositional representational theories, and equally of course connectionist theories, where activation patterns are a direct reﬂection of input patterns.
2.5 The Issues in the Light of Empirical Evidence
So now at last we might be prepared to accept the idea that it is worth empirically investigating the kinds of inﬂuence a speciﬁc language might have on our mental coding of scenes and events, our nonlinguistic memory and inference. In fact, there is already a quite impressive body of evidence that demonstrates signiﬁcant effects here. I will review a few examples, concentrating on our own work.
Curiously enough, the color work in the tradition of Berlin and Kay (1969), which has been taken to indicate simple universals of lexical coding, has also yielded evidence for the impact of linguistic categories on memory and perceptual discriminations. As noted above, the lexical universals are of a conditional sort; for example, if a language has just three color words, one will cover the ‘‘cool’’ range (black, green, blue), another the ‘‘warm’’ range (red, yellow, orange), and another the ‘‘bright’’ range (white, pink, pale blue, etc.) (see Kay and McDaniel 1978). So it is easy to ﬁnd languages that differ in their color coding. Lenneberg and Roberts (1956) had earlier shown that having speciﬁc terms for, say, ‘yellow’ versus ‘orange’, helped English speakers memorize colors, compared to Zuni speakers who have no such lexical discrimination. Lucy (1981) showed similar effects for Yucatec versus Spanish versus English

38 Levinson
speakers, and Davidoff, Davies, and Roberson (1999) did the same for English versus Berinmo. Kay and Kempton (1984) explored the effects of linguistic coding on perceptual discriminability and found that if a language like English discriminates ‘blue’ and ‘green’, while another like Tarahumara does not, English speakers but not Tarahumara speakers will exaggerate the perceptual differences on the boundary. This suggests that our visual perception may be biased by linguistic categorization just as our auditory perception clearly is by the speciﬁc phonemes in a language (which is why of course late second language learners have difﬁculty perceiving and producing the alien speech sounds).
Turning to our own work, in a large-scale long-term collaborative enterprise involving two score researchers, we have researched linguistic differences in the spatial domain. Our goals have been ﬁrst, to understand the linguistic differences here, and second, to then explore the relation of those linguistic differences to nonlinguistic cognition. I have already outlined above some of the quite surprising linguistic differences to be found across languages; in general, it is hard to ﬁnd any pair of spatial descriptors with the same denotation across languages (see, e.g., Levinson and Wilkins, in press). In the subdomain of frames of reference, we have pursued the nonlinguistic correlates in detail. The following is a synopsis of much detailed work (see Levinson 1996, 1997b, in press; Pederson et al. 1998; and references therein).
As mentioned above, languages make different use of the three basic frames of reference. Some languages, like English or other European languages, employ the relative frame of reference (involving left/right/ front/back terms projected from a viewpoint) along with the intrinsic (involving properties of the landmark or reference object, e.g., its intrinsic top, back, sides, etc.). Other languages, like Tzeltal or Arrernte, use no relative frame of reference, but instead supplement an intrinsic system with an absolute one—that is, a cardinal-direction type system. In languages like these, speakers can’t say ‘Pass me the cup to your left’, or ‘Take the ﬁrst right’, or ‘He’s hiding behind the tree’—the relevant spatial expressions simply don’t exist. Instead, they have to say ‘Pass me the cup to the west’, or ‘Take the ﬁrst turn to the south’, or ‘He’s hiding east of the tree’, as appropriate. Such cardinal-direction systems are actually quite diverse (e.g., they may have arbitrary directions unrelated to the

Language and Mind 39
earth’s poles) and are always different from the English speaker’s use of map coordinates (e.g., in the English system there is no linguistic convention about how many degrees on either side of grid-north still constitutes ‘north’, and English speakers only use this system on a geographic scale).
We made the following predictions. First, speakers of languages with absolute coordinates should have a better sense of direction than speakers of relative languages: they not only have to know where, say, ‘south’ is at any one moment (otherwise they couldn’t speak the language), but they also need to know, for example, that place B is south of A, because they may have a verb ‘go-south’ properly used for any motion from A to B. We transported people from three absolute communities to novel locations and got them to point to a range of other locations at varying distances. They can do this with remarkable accuracy, but speakers of relative languages cannot (Levinson, in press). We have also examined unreﬂective gesture while speaking: for absolute speakers, gestures to places are geographically accurate; for relative speakers, are not. Second, we supposed that speakers of absolute languages would have to maintain internal representations of space in terms of ﬁxed bearings, rather than egocentric coordinates. That is because if memories were coded in egocentric coordinates, there would be no way to describe them in the relevant language: there is no translation algorithm from egocentric coordinates to geocentric ones, or vice versa (you can’t get from the description ‘The knife was north of the fork’ to the description ‘The knife was left of the fork’, or vice versa). Since one might want to talk about any observed situation, it had better be memorized in coordinates appropriate to the language. To test this, we invented a rotation paradigm, with which it is possible to distinguish nonlinguistic mental coding in any of the frames of reference. For example, subjects see an arrow on a table pointing to their left, or south. They are now rotated 180 degrees and are asked to place the arrow on another table so it is just as before. If they point it to their left, they thought about it in terms of egocentric coordinates; if to their right (i.e., south), in geocentric coordinates. This paradigm allows examination of different psychological capacities, and we designed a battery of tests exploring recognition memory, recall, and inference of different kinds, all conducted under rotation. The tasks were

40 Levinson
carried out in four relative and six absolute language communities. The results are quite startling: overwhelmingly, subjects follow the coding pattern in their language when performing these entirely nonlinguistic tasks (Levinson 1996, in press).
We ﬁnd these results to be convincing evidence that linguistic coding is both a facilitator of a speciﬁc cognitive style and a bottleneck, constraining mental representations in line with the output modality. It seems that preferred frames of reference in language deeply affect our mental life. They affect the kind of mental coding of spatial relations in memory, and the way in which we reason about space, since the different frames of reference have different logical properties (see Levinson 1996). They affect the kinds of mental maps we maintain (as shown by the navigation experiments mentioned above), even the kind of mental imagery we use when we gesture. These are anything but superﬁcial correlates of a mode of linguistic coding.
In a recent paper, Li and Gleitman (2002) try to resist these conclusions and reassert a Simple Nativist perspective. They carried out one simpliﬁed version of one of our tasks with an American student population and claimed that they could induce absolute or relative coding by manipulating the conditions of the task. First, the task yielded a relative result indoors, but a mixed relative/absolute result outdoors. Second, by placing salient landmarks or spatial cues at alternate ends of the stimulus and response tables, subjects could be made to construct the response in line with the landmark cue. Li and Gleitman conclude that we all think equally in relative or absolute frames of reference; it just depends on the conditions under which one coding system or another becomes more appropriate. Unfortunately, their results are either not replicable (the outdoors condition) or betray a misunderstanding of the nature of the three frames of reference (the landmark cues condition). When they used salient spatial cues on the stimulus and response tables, what they were actually doing was invoking a response in the intrinsic frame of reference, not the absolute one. We showed this by reproducing their experiment and introducing a new condition: subjects were now rotated 90 degrees instead of 180 degrees (Levinson et al. 2002). If you see a row of animals headed leftward, or south, on table 1 toward a jug, and are then rotated to face table 2 at 90 degrees, and are asked to place the animals just as they were (with an emphasis on remembering which animals were

Language and Mind 41
in which order), a response that preserves them heading left or heading south or heading toward the jug can easily be distinguished. English- or Dutch-speaking subjects will place the animals so they are heading either left (relative) or toward the jug (intrinsic), not south (absolute). That’s because English and Dutch offer both the relative and intrinsic frames of reference—although the relative is dominant, as can be shown by increasing the memory load (e.g., by adding to the number of animals), whereupon the relative is selected over the intrinsic. In short, pace Li and Gleitman, the evidence remains that the frames of reference used in people’s language match those used in their nonlinguistic cognition.
There are many other results that support the idea that linguistic coding has an effect on nonlinguistic cognition. Special mention should be made of the work of John Lucy (1992a; see also Lucy and Gaskins, this volume), which demonstrates that the original ideas of Whorf can be veriﬁed—namely, the idea that grammatical patterning with semantic correlates may have an especially powerful effect on implicit categorization. English has obligatory number marking (singular vs. plural) on countable nominals, while Yucatec has only optional number marking, mostly only on animates. Following the hypothesis that this insistent number marking in English might have nonlinguistic effects, Lucy showed that English speakers are better at remembering number in nonlinguistic stimuli. In work with Suzanne Gaskins, he has gone on to show that this lack of number marking in Yucatec is associated with nominals whose semantics are unspeciﬁed for quantiﬁcational unit (Lucy and Gaskins 2001). They tend to denote not bounded units, but essence or ‘‘stuff’’; thus, the term used for ‘banana’ actually denotes any entity made of banana-essence (e.g., the tree or the leaf or the fruit). On sorting tasks, Yucatec speakers behave differently than English speakers: English speakers tend to sort by shape or function, Yucatec speakers by the material out of which things are made. The suggestion is that the pattern in the grammar has far-reaching correlations with implicit mental categories.
2.6 Conclusion
Where are we? I have tried to establish that (1) languages vary in their semantics just as they do in their form, (2) semantic differences are

42 Levinson
bound to engender cognitive differences, (3) these cognitive correlates of semantic differences can be empirically found on a widespread basis. As a consequence, the semantic version of Simple Nativism ought to be as dead as a dodo. But it isn’t.
Why not? One reason is that its proponents think they have an argument that it just has to be right, so no negative evidence will be seriously entertained! The argument of course is a learnability argument. Consider what the poor child has to do: ﬁnd the meaning corresponding to some acoustic signal—the child must segment the signal, ﬁnd the word forms, and then hypothesize the meanings. Suppose, as Fodor, Pinker, and Gleitman hold, that the child is already provided with the relevant conceptual bundles; then all she has to do is map strings of phonemes to ready-made conceptual bundles. This is already difﬁcult, since there are lots of those bundles. Now, suppose the picture was radically different, and the child had to construct the bundles—not a chance! Even worse, suppose that the child has not only to construct the possible meanings for words, but even to ﬁgure out how the adults think, since they think differently in different cultures. Now the child ﬁrst has to learn the local cognitive style, and then construct the relevant meanings in line with the cognitive style, before ﬁnally being in a position to map the acoustics onto the meanings. The picture is hopeless—Simple Nativism just has to be right!
We can disarm this argument (but see Levinson 2001 for the full counterargument). First, the Fodorean picture doesn’t really help. If languages only label antecedently existing concepts, the set of those concepts must include every possible concept lexicalizable in every possible language—a billion or more to be sure. So how will knowing that the needle is already in the haystack help the child ﬁnd the one correct concept to match to a particular acoustic wave? Second, the picture of the child thumbing through her innate lexicon to ﬁnd the right antecedently existing concept is surely absurd in the ﬁrst place; once the lexicon gets to any size at all, it will be much easier to construct the concept than to ﬁnd it. What the child is going to do is try and ﬁgure out what those peculiar adults or elder siblings are really preoccupied with. She will use every clue provided to her, and there are plenty. And some of the most valuable clues will be provided in many different ways by the fact that the adults think in a way tightly consistent with the semantics of the

Language and Mind 43
language they speak. For example, suppose the adults speak a language where the relative frame of reference predominates. Every aspect of the environment will reﬂect that fact—the way doors or books open, the arrangement of things (knife always to the right of the fork, socks in the left drawer), the nature of gesture (pointing to the side the referent was on when they were looking at it, not where it actually is from here now), the preferred side of the sidewalk they choose to walk on. In contrast, suppose the adults speak a language where the absolute frame of reference predominates. Now they won’t care about preserving egocentric constancies; they will only care that one sleeps with one’s head always to the north, builds windbreaks to the east, and, when pointing, points in the veridical direction. A thousand little details of the built environment and, more importantly, the conduct of interaction (see Tomasello, this volume) will inform the discerning toddler again and again till she gets the message. It is just because we think in line with how we speak, that the clues are not all in the language but are distributed throughout the context of language learning. This new picture doesn’t banish the puzzles of how children perform the incredible feat of learning a language, but one thing is certain: it doesn’t make it any more of an impossible feat than it was on the old picture given to us by the Simple Nativists.
So the overall message is that Simple Nativism has outlived its utility; it blocks a proper understanding of the biological roots of language, it introduces incoherence into our theory, it blinds us to the reality of linguistic variation and discourages interesting research on the languagecognition interface. As far as its semantic tenets go, it is simply false— semantic variation across languages is rich in every detail. We don’t map words onto antecedently existing concepts, we build them according to need. That’s why cognitive development in children exists, and why the history of science shows progress. The reason we have a developed vocabulary (instead of the limited repertoire of other animals) is that we have found it helps us to think. How it does that is explained by that foundational cornerstone of cognitive psychology, Miller’s (1956) theory of recoding as a method of increasing computational power by getting around the bottleneck of short-term memory (see Cowan 2001 for an update). Linguistically motivated concepts are food for thought.

The Key Is Social Cognition
Michael Tomasello
3.1 Introduction
Surveying human evolution and history, it is difﬁcult to ﬁnd a good analogy to language. But the closest might be money. Economic activities— in the broad sense of people exchanging goods and services with one another—antedate the invention of money by many millennia, and economic activities do not absolutely require money. But the invention of money as a symbol for exchanges, and its historical development into more complex forms such as paper and electronic money, is clearly responsible for some new forms of economic activity. Certainly, modern economies could not exist as they do without something resembling the monetary symbol systems currently in use.
Let’s try another, more cognitive analogy. Basic quantitative skills are possessed by all mammals and even some bird species, and so they assuredly do not rely on written symbols and notations. But when human beings invented written symbols and notations to help them count and calculate, all of a sudden they began to count and calculate in some new and more complex ways. And it is well known that some notation systems enable certain kinds of calculations that others do not. For example, it is basically impossible to imagine doing algebra or calculus (not to mention long division) with Roman numerals; something like Arabic numerals, based on the place value system (and with a zero), is required for modern mathematics.
The way human beings behave and think thus changes when symbols, including linguistic symbols, become involved. Money and mathematics are two good examples, but the analogy to language is not perfect.

48 Tomasello
Spoken language is more basic than these. In many ways, minted money and Arabic numerals are more like written language than spoken language—and indeed, historically the invention of written symbols for speech, mathematical activities, and economic activities were closely intertwined. Ontogenetically, human beings acquire competence with a spoken language much earlier than with written symbols, and this happens in close concert with their earliest understandings of many aspects of their physical and social worlds.
I have a speciﬁc hypothesis about how language transforms cognitive activity during human ontogeny. (Perhaps the hypothesis may be extended to human evolution, but that is another story.) It is based on the conviction that the two main functions of language—for communication and for cognitive representation—are closely interrelated. The key is the nature of uniquely human social cognition and how it enables the learning and use of linguistic symbols for purposes of interpersonal communication beginning in the second year of life. Gradually, these interpersonal instruments are internalized and used intrapersonally, becoming the major representational medium for certain kinds of human cognition. The hypothesis is thus explicitly Vygotskian in spirit, but I am focusing on much younger children than Vygotsky ([1934] 1962, 1978) and, I would argue, on much more fundamental aspects of human cognition.
3.2 Joint Attention as Social Cognition
All primate species cognitively represent the world. They recall where things are located after signiﬁcant delays, they anticipate impending events, they use spatial detours and shortcuts creatively (cognitive mapping), they categorize novel objects on the basis of perceptual similarity, and they solve novel problems on the basis of mental trial-and-error or ‘‘insight’’ (Tomasello and Call 1997). These activities all involve the ability to cognitively represent the world in the sense that past sensorimotor experiences can be preserved and, in some cases, actively represented and consulted as a guide for behaviors such as navigation, search, or problem solving.

Social Cognition 49
Before they begin to use language, human infants cognitively represent the world in many of these same kinds of ways, and—importantly—in no others. However, socially and communicatively, the prelinguistic infant is doing things that other primate species are not. Speciﬁcally, she is both following into adults’ attention to outside objects and events—for example, by following their pointing gestures or imitating their actions on objects—and actively directing their attention to outside objects and events —for example, by pointing and showing objects and events to others. No other species on the planet points to or shows objects and events to its conspeciﬁcs in these ways. This is a fact with far-reaching implications for our understanding of language and its relation to human cognition.
Carpenter, Nagell, and Tomasello (1998) followed longitudinally the emergence of nine different ‘‘joint attentional’’ behaviors, along with the emergence of linguistic skills, in infants from 9 to 15 months of age. The joint attentional behaviors included both those in which the infant followed into the adult’s behavior or attention (e.g., gaze following, imitation of actions on objects) and those in which the infant directed the adult’s attention via such actions as pointing and showing. Language comprehension and production were also assessed. The relevant ﬁndings were as follows: (1) All nine of the nonlinguistic joint attentional behaviors emerged in individuals as a group (mostly within a three- to fourmonth time window). (2) These behaviors emerged in a predictable order: ﬁrst, behaviors that involved the infant checking that the adult was attending; next, those in which the infant followed adult attention to outside objects and events; and ﬁnally, those in which the infant actively directed adult attention to outside objects and events. (3) There was a very strong correlation between infants’ ability to engage in joint attentional activities with their mothers and the emergence of language comprehension and production.
Carpenter, Nagell, and Tomasello (1998) argued for two key theoretical points relevant to the current discussion. First, they argued that the reason that all of these joint attentional behaviors emerge together is that they all represent—each in its own way—manifestations of infants’ newfound understanding of other persons as intentional agents, like themselves, whose attention to outside objects can be followed into,

50 Tomasello
directed, and shared. Other primate species do not understand others of their species in this same way, and so they do not engage in this complex of joint attentional activities. Second, Carpenter, Nagell, and Tomasello argued that the reason linguistic skills emerge on the heels of these joint attentional activities—and strongly correlate with them—is that language is itself a form of joint attentional activity. The infant’s ﬁrst comprehension of language is nothing other than her emerging understanding of utterances as indications of other persons’ intention that she join them in attending to something. The infant’s ﬁrst production of language is nothing other than her emerging ability to express her own communicative intention that other persons join her in attending to something. Simply said, language is about sharing and directing attention, and so it is no surprise that it emerges along with other joint attentional skills.
It is worth pausing for a moment to note that theories of language development that neglect these joint attentional skills have basically no explanation for why language emerges when it does. Prelinguistic infants, and many animal species, are able to (1) perceive outside entities, (2) perceive discrete vocal sounds, and (3) associate sounds with visual experiences. So why can they not learn a piece of language? The reason is that associating sounds with experiences is not language. It is simply associating sounds with experiences—in much the way that a pet dog associates the sound ‘‘Dinner!’’ with the experience of food. Learning a piece of language requires that the learner understand that the other person is making this sound in order to direct her attention to something on which he, the speaker, is already focused. Theories that do not appreciate the essential, indeed constitutive, role of this kind of social cognition in the process of language acquisition simply cannot explain why most children begin learning language only after their ﬁrst birthday and not earlier.
And so, the ﬁrst point is that language is acquired as a joint attentional activity for sharing and directing the attention of other persons. The social-cognitive ability that enables such activities—the understanding of other persons as intentional agents like the self—is speciﬁc to human beings and emerges reliably at around 9 to 12 months of age in human ontogeny.

Social Cognition 51
3.3 Organizing Cognition for Purposes of Linguistic Communication
What makes skills of linguistic communication different from other joint attentional skills, of course, is the fact that the language the child is learning antedates her arrival on the scene. Each of the world’s 6,000þ languages is a collection of symbols and constructions that some community of people has created over historical time for purposes of sharing and directing the attention of one another. What is so mind-boggling about languages is the unbelievable number of different ways each one of them has accumulated for accomplishing these tasks.
To concretize the discussion, let us focus on the process of establishing a topic by means of what philosophers call an ‘‘act of reference’’—in this case, to a single individual object in the world. One could imagine a language in which this was done with proper names only. That is, just as we refer to highly familiar people, places, and things with proper names such as Bill, Fluffy, Disneyland, and Big Bertha (a golf club), so we might refer to each object in the world with its own proper name. But presumably this would at some point overtax human memory. Consequently, individuals typically have proper names for only a few hundred or perhaps thousand especially familiar persons, places, and things in the world (a different set for different individuals), and in addition they use many thousands of category labels (common nouns). To use these category labels to direct another person’s attention to an individual object (in cases in which its identity is in question), they must then use some further means of speciﬁcation, either linguistic (e.g., the X in my room) or nonlinguistic (e.g., pointing).
It is an astonishing property of these category labels that they are used to refer to objects from many different perspectives depending on both the communicative context and the communicative goals of the speaker. As just a sampling, common nouns embody attentional construals based on such things as (1) granularity-speciﬁcity (thing, furniture, chair, desk chair), (2) perspective (coast, shore, beach, vacation lot), and (3) function (father, lawyer, man, American) (Langacker 1991).
Then, once a speaker and a hearer have established shared attention to a particular X, they can make future references to it in the same context with some short, all-purpose, easy-to-use symbol like it.

52 Tomasello
The outcome is that an individual language user looks at a particular tree and, before drawing the attention of her interlocutor to that tree, must decide, based on her assessment of the listener’s current knowledge and expectations (and her own communicative goal), whether to use that tree over there, the oak, that hundred-year-old oak, the tree, the bagswing tree, that thing in the front yard, the ornament, the embarrassment, that one, that, it, or any number of other expressions. In terms of the new information being communicated, when the speaker wants to predicate (focus the hearer’s attention on) something about the tree, she must decide if the tree is in, is standing in, is growing in, was placed in, or is ﬂourishing in—or whatever—the front yard. And in the construction chosen to unite topic and focus, many more speciﬁc perspectives arise as the speaker attempts to highlight or downplay speciﬁc referents (e.g., A tree is in the yard vs. In the yard is a tree)—and even more than that when multiple participants are involved, as in He broke the vase, The vase broke, It was him that broke the vase, It was the vase that got broken, and on and on. Finally, based on categories of consistent functions in constructions, speakers may actually construe things in ways other than their ‘‘normal’’ ontological class. For example, the speaker can conceptualize objects as actions (as in He porched the newspaper), actions as objects (as in Skiing is fun), and attributes as objects (as in Blue is my favorite color). Ultimately, users of a language become able to conceptualize all kinds of abstract situations in terms of concrete metaphorical construals—for example, Love is a journey, The ofﬁce is pressing on me, or My spirits are high (Lakoff 1987).
The main point is that decisions to construe a referent or predication in one way rather than another possible way are not made on the basis of the speaker’s direct goal with respect to the object or activity involved; rather, they are made on the basis of her goal with respect to the listener’s interest and attention to that object or activity. The speaker knows that the listener, as a user of the same language, shares with her the same range of choices for construal; these are in the form of the myriad perspectives that are symbolized in the known, but on this occasion not chosen, symbols and constructions in the shared language. Human linguistic symbols are thus both intersubjective—(both users know, and each knows that the other one knows, the range of possibilities) and

Social Cognition 53
perspectival (any one symbol embodies one way, out of these many simultaneously available ways, that a situation may be construed for a given communicative purpose). It is difﬁcult to think of how or why, in the absence of linguistic communication, a child or adult might choose to construct all of the many different perspectives on things that are routinely symbolized in human languages.
3.4 New Forms of Thinking
The speciﬁc developmental hypothesis is this. As the young child internalizes a linguistic symbol or construction—as she culturally learns the human perspective embodied in that symbol or construction—she cognitively represents not just the perceptual or motoric aspects of a situation, but also one way, among other ways of which she is also aware, that the current situation may be attentionally construed by ‘‘us,’’ the users of the symbol. The intersubjective and perspectival nature of linguistic symbols thus creates a clear break with straightforward perceptual or sensorimotor cognitive representations. It removes them to a very large extent from the perceptual situation at hand, and in ways much more profound than the fact that they can stand for physically absent objects and events (and other simple forms of spatiotemporal displacement). Rather, the intersubjective and perspectival nature of linguistic symbols actually undermines the whole concept of a perceptual situation, by layering on top of it the multitudinous and multifarious perspectives that are communicatively possible for those of us who share a certain set of linguistic symbols.
This is the major sense in which, as I proposed initially, the communicative and cognitive functions of language are inextricably intertwined (see also Tomasello 1999). But it must be emphasized that acquiring skills of linguistic communication does not magically create new cognitive skills and representations out of nothing. Acquiring a language in the ﬁrst place requires the whole panoply of basic primate cognitive skills of perception, categorization, memory, relational understanding, problem solving, and so on. In addition, it requires the uniquely human form of social cognition—understanding other persons as intentional agents like the self—without which there could be no humanlike forms

54 Tomasello
of cultural or symbolic activity at all. But then, in my hypothesis, as these skills are used to acquire a historically evolved set of linguistic symbols and constructions, children begin to think in some fundamentally new ways.
This is not the end of the ontogenetic story, of course. We might also go on to somewhat older children and examine how they internalize their entire symbolic and linguistic dialogues with other persons in Vygotskian fashion. In Tomasello 1999, I attempted to show how this ‘‘second stage’’ of internalization leads young children to engage in such qualitatively new forms of cognitive activity as multiple classiﬁcations of objects and events, metaphorical construals of abstract situations and events, dialogic thinking, and reﬂecting on one’s own thinking. I also attempted to show that the internalization process is not something mystical, as some seem to believe; rather, it is simply the normal process of cultural learning from others when the activity being learned is one that involves perspective taking. Reﬂecting on one’s own thinking derives from internalization in the special case of an activity in which another person takes a perspective on you and your cognitive activities—as in so-called instructed learning (Tomasello, Kruger, and Ratner 1993).
But all of this is a booster rocket on top of the primary reality that emerges at the end of infancy: the intersubjective and perspectival forms of symbolic communication that children engage in with other persons— and the internalization of these into the kind of ﬂexible and powerful cognitive representations characteristic of, and characteristic only of, the species Homo sapiens.
3.5 Linguistic Cognition
We may say that thinking is essentially the activity of operating with signs. Ludwig Wittgenstein
We have no power of thinking without signs. Charles Sanders Peirce
Only in terms of gestures as signiﬁcant symbols is the existence of mind or intelligence possible. George Herbert Mead
Thought is not merely expressed in words; it comes into existence through them. Lev Vygotsky

Social Cognition 55
These four thinkers have thought as much about thinking as anyone. What could they possibly mean by saying, essentially, that thinking is only possible with symbols? They presumably do not mean that a chimpanzee or human infant using a tool is not thinking in any way, but only that these nonlinguistic creatures are not thinking in the same way as symbolic creatures; there exist forms of cognitive activity in which they cannot engage. In my terms, perhaps what these four thinkers mean is that intersubjective and perspectival symbols that are learned and used in communicative interactions with other symbol users create the possibility of examining things from many different perspectives simultaneously, for anticipating the differing perspectives of other persons on things, and indeed for reﬂecting on one’s own thinking from different perspectives as well. It is these kinds of thinking in which nonsymbolic creatures are unable to engage. They are unable because they do not possess the representational medium within which to conduct such dialogic and multilogic forms of mental activity; that is to say, they do not possess the representational medium that emerges as human infants begin to symbolically communicate with their fellow creatures at around 1 year of age.
Some might object to this proposal by claiming that a prelinguistic child or nonhuman primate may construe an object or situation in more than one way: one time a conspeciﬁc is a friend and the next time an enemy; one time a tree is for climbing to avoid predators and the next time it is for making a nest in. In these different interactions with the same entity, the individual is certainly deploying its attention differentially depending on its goal at that moment—taking different perspectives, if you will. But shifting attention sequentially in this manner as a function of the goal of the moment is not the same thing as knowing simultaneously a number of different ways in which something might be construed. Does a chimpanzee or a prelinguistic human infant understand that this object in front of her is simultaneously an orange, a piece of fruit, a meal, an object, a gift from a friend, a sphere, and a temptation—among other things? Does a chimpanzee or a human infant understand that this event occurring in front of her is simultaneously a ﬁght, a chase, a social interaction, an act of retribution, an act of aggression, a tragedy, and an impending murder—among other things? If she does not, what does this imply about how she can think about,

56 Tomasello
and cognitively represent, the objects and events taking place around her?
Since Whorf 1956, the language-cognition question has focused on whether learning one language, rather than another language, affects nonlinguistic cognition. The acid test is whether learning one language rather than another language leads to some discernible difference in how individuals behave in nonverbal tasks that assess their perception of colors, or of space, or of object shapes (Gumperz and Levinson 1996). What I am talking about here—by invoking nonhuman primates, prelinguistic infants, and the like—is something different, and indeed at the moment I am agnostic about the Whorﬁan question in particular. What I am talking about is what Slobin (1991) calls ‘‘thinking for speaking.’’ From this perspective, there is no privileging of nonlinguistic cognition as somehow the real thing—which we then see if language affects. From this perspective, it is preferable to simply say that cognition takes many forms depending on many factors, and one form—which is unique to the human species after 1 or 2 years of age—is linguistic cognition in which individuals structure their thinking by means of one or another historically evolved collection of intersubjective and perspectival symbols and constructions. Language does not affect cognition; it is one form that cognition can take.
To summarize, the three main claims made in this chapter—which together justify its title—are as follows:
1. The evolution of linguistic communication in the human species and the acquisition of language by human children rest crucially on uniquely human skills of social cognition. These skills enable individuals both to read the communicative intentions of others, as embodied in their symbolic behaviors, and to culturally learn those symbolic behaviors themselves.
2. When used in acts of communication, these social-cognitive skills serve to create intersubjectively understood and perspectivally based linguistic symbols, which can be used to invite other persons to construe phenomena from any one of many simultaneously available perspectives. Internalizing such acts of symbolic communication creates especially ﬂexible and powerful forms of cognitive representation, and these then, later in ontogeny, enable metaphorical, dialogic, and reﬂective thinking.

Social Cognition 57
3. Communicating with other persons linguistically thus leads human beings to conceptualize things and events in the world in myriad different complex ways. Without these communicative activities, human beings would have no reason to conceptualize things and events in these ways, and so they simply would not do it.

4.1 Introduction
Speakers of different languages must attend to and encode strikingly different aspects of the world in order to use their language properly (Sapir 1921; Slobin 1996). For example, to say that ‘‘the elephant ate the peanuts’’ in English, we must include tense—the fact that the event happened in the past. In Mandarin, indicating when the event occurred would be optional and couldn’t be included in the verb. In Russian, the verb would need to include tense, whether the peanut-eater was male or female (though only in the past tense), and whether said peanut-eater ate all of the peanuts or just a portion of them. In Turkish, one would specify whether the event being reported was witnessed or hearsay. Do these quirks of languages affect the way their speakers think about the world? Do English, Mandarin, Russian, and Turkish speakers end up thinking about the world differently simply because they speak different languages?
The idea that thought is shaped by language is most commonly associated with the writings of Benjamin Lee Whorf. Whorf, impressed by linguistic diversity, proposed that the categories and distinctions of each language enshrine a way of perceiving, analyzing, and acting in the world. Insofar as languages differ, their speakers too should differ in how they perceive and act in objectively similar situations (Whorf 1956). This strong Whorﬁan view—that thought and action are entirely determined by language—has long been abandoned in cognitive science. However, deﬁnitively answering less deterministic versions of the ‘‘Does language shape thought?’’ question has proven very difﬁcult. Some studies have

62 Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips
claimed evidence to the afﬁrmative (e.g., Boroditsky 1999, 2001; Bowerman 1996; Davidoff, Davies, and Roberson 1999; Imai and Gentner 1997; Levinson 1996; Lucy 1992; Slobin 1996); others, evidence to the contrary (e.g., [Rosch] Heider 1972; Li and Gleitman 2002).
4.2 Thinking for Speaking
In part, the ‘‘Does language shape thought?’’ question has been difﬁcult to answer because it is so imprecise. A different phrasing has been suggested by Slobin (1996), who proposed replacing language and thought with speaking, thinking, and thinking for speaking. One advantage of this substitution is that it allows us to distinguish between what are often called linguistic and nonlinguistic thought. Basically, cognitive processes involved in accessing and selecting words, placing them in grammatical structures, planning speech, and so on, are all instances of thinking for speaking. Thinking for speaking differs from one language to another. For example, when planning to utter a verb, English speakers never need to worry about grammatical gender agreement between the verb and the subject of the sentence. By contrast, Russian speakers do need to worry about this, and so their thinking for speaking will necessarily be different from that of English speakers.
4.3 Beyond Thinking for Speaking
A further question to ask is whether the habits that people acquire in thinking for speaking a particular language will manifest themselves in their thinking even when they are not planning speech in that language. What if people are performing some nonlinguistic task (i.e., a task that can be accomplished through some nonlinguistic means) or thinking for a different language? For example, are native Russian speakers more likely to notice whether all or only some of the peanuts were eaten even when they’re speaking English? One way to rephrase the ‘‘Does language shape thought?’’ question is to ask, ‘‘Does thinking for speaking a particular language have an effect on how people think when not thinking for speaking that same language?’’

Sex, Syntax, and Semantics 63
Further, how (through what cognitive mechanisms) can thinking for speaking a particular language exert inﬂuence over other types of thinking? Are some cognitive domains more susceptible to linguistic inﬂuence than others, and if so, why? For example, early work on color showed striking similarity in color memory among speakers of different languages despite wide variation in color terminology (Heider 1972; but see Davidoff, Davies, and Roberson 1999; Kay and Kempton 1984; Lucy and Shweder 1979). However, research into how people conceptualize more abstract domains like time has uncovered striking crosslinguistic differences in thought (Boroditsky 1999, 2001). Why would there be such strong evidence for universality in color perception, but quite the opposite for thinking about time? One possibility is that language is most powerful in inﬂuencing thought for more abstract domains, that is, ones not so reliant on sensory experience (Boroditsky 1999, 2000, 2001). While the ability to perceive colors is heavily constrained by universals of physics and physiology, the conception of time (say, as a vertical or a horizontal medium) is not constrained by physical experience and so is free to vary across languages and cultures (see Boroditsky 2000, 2001, for further discussion).
In this chapter, I consider an extreme point along this concreteabstract continuum: the inﬂuence of grammatical gender on the way people think about inanimate objects. Forks and frying pans do not (by virtue of being inanimate) have a biological gender. The perceptual information available for most objects does not provide much evidence as to their gender, and so conclusive information about the gender of objects is only available in language (and only in those languages that have grammatical gender). This chapter examines whether people’s mental representations of objects are inﬂuenced by the grammatical genders assigned to these objects’ names in their native language.
4.4 Grammatical Gender
Unlike English, many languages have a grammatical gender system whereby all nouns (e.g., the words that refer to penguins, pockets, and toasters) are assigned a gender. Many languages only have masculine

64 Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips
and feminine genders, but some also assign neuter, vegetative, and other more obscure genders. When speaking a language with grammatical gender, speakers are required to mark objects as gendered through deﬁnite articles and gendered pronouns, and often they need to modify adjectives or even verbs to agree in gender with the nouns. Does talking about inanimate objects as if they were masculine or feminine actually lead people to think of inanimate objects as having a gender? Could the grammatical genders assigned to objects by a language inﬂuence people’s mental representations of objects?
4.4.1 Why Might Grammatical Gender Be Taken as Meaningful? A priori, there are reasons to think that people would not take grammatical gender as meaningful. First, the assignment of grammatical gender to object names often appears to be semantically arbitrary. As Mark Twain noted in A Tramp Abroad, ‘‘In German, a young lady has no sex, while a turnip has. . . . [A] tree is male, its buds are female, its leaves are neuter; horses are sexless, dogs are male, cats are female . . . tomcats included.’’ Second, the grammatical genders assigned to names of particular objects vary greatly across languages (Braine 1987).1 For example, the name for the sun is feminine in German, masculine in Spanish, and neuter in Russian. The name for the moon, on the other hand, is feminine in Spanish and Russian, but masculine in German.
But there are also reasons to think that people would take grammatical gender as meaningful. Since many other grammatical distinctions reﬂect differences that are observable in the world (the plural inﬂection, for example), children learning to speak a language with a grammatical gender system have no a priori reason to believe that grammatical gender doesn’t indicate a meaningful distinction between types of objects. Indeed, many adult philosophers throughout history have thought that grammatical gender systems reﬂected the essential properties of objects, and even took a considerable amount of pride in the thought that the natural genders of objects were captured in the grammatical subtlety of their language (see Fodor 1959 for a history). Children learning a language may make similar (though perhaps less patriotically minded) hypotheses. Further, since most children grow up learning only one language, they have no opportunity to perform the comparative linguistics

Sex, Syntax, and Semantics 65
necessary to discover the seemingly arbitrary nature of grammatical gender assignment. For all they know, the grammatical genders assigned by their language are the true universal genders of objects.
4.4.2 How Could Grammatical Gender Affect Meaning? How might people’s representations of objects be affected by the grammatical gender of their labels? One possibility is that in order to efﬁciently learn the grammatical gender of a noun to begin with, people focus on some property of that noun’s referent that may pick it out as masculine or feminine. For example, if the word for ‘‘sun’’ is masculine in one’s language, one might try to remember this by conceiving of the sun in terms of what are perceived as stereotypically masculine properties like powerful and threatening. If the word for ‘‘sun’’ is feminine, on the other hand, one might focus on its warming and nourishing qualities.
Even after the grammatical genders of nouns are learned, language may inﬂuence thought during thinking for speaking (Slobin 1996). When speaking a language with grammatical gender, speakers often need to mark objects as gendered through deﬁnite articles (e.g., le and la in French), refer to objects using gendered pronouns (e.g., if the word for ‘‘fork’’ is masculine, a speaker might say the equivalent of He is sharp), and alter adjectives or even verbs to agree in gender with the nouns (e.g., in Russian, verbs in the past tense must agree in gender with their subject nouns). Needing to refer to an object as masculine or feminine may lead people to selectively attend to that object’s masculine or feminine qualities, thus making them more salient in the representation.
4.4.3 Does Grammatical Gender Affect Meaning? So, does talking about inanimate objects as if they were masculine or feminine lead people to think of them as masculine or feminine? Preliminary evidence suggests that it may (Jakobson 1966; Konishi 1993; Sera, Berge, and del Castillo 1994). In one early study, Russian speakers were asked to personify days of the week (reported in Jakobson 1966). They consistently personiﬁed the grammatically masculine days of the week (Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday) as males, and the grammatically feminine days of the week (Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday) as females, though they could not explicitly say why they did so.

66 Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips
In another study, German and Spanish speakers rated a set of nouns on the dimension of potency (a dimension highly associated with masculinity) (Konishi 1993). Half of the nouns were grammatically masculine in German and feminine in Spanish, and the other half were masculine in Spanish and feminine in German. Both German and Spanish speakers judged the word for ‘‘man’’ to be more potent than the word for ‘‘woman.’’ Interestingly, they also judged nouns that were grammatically masculine in their native language to be more potent than nouns that were grammatically feminine. This was true even though all of the test nouns referred to objects or entities that had no biological gender (including names of inanimate objects, places, events, and abstract entities).
Converging evidence comes from a series of studies in which Spanish speakers were asked to rate pictures of objects as masculine or feminine (Sera, Berge, and del Castillo 1994). Spanish speakers consistently classiﬁed pictured objects in accordance with their grammatical gender in Spanish. The effect was more pronounced when the pictures were accompanied by their Spanish labels. The grammatical gender consistency effect also showed up when subjects were asked to attribute a man’s or a woman’s voice to each picture. Finally, Sera, Berge, and del Castillo found that by about second grade, Spanish-speaking children assigned voices to objects in accordance with the grammatical gender of their labels.
4.4.4 Limitations of Previous Evidence Although results of these studies are suggestive, there are serious limitations common to these and most other studies of linguistic determinism. First, speakers of different languages are usually tested only in their native language. Any differences in these comparisons can only show the effect of a language on thinking for that particular language. These studies cannot reveal whether experience with a language affects language-independent thought such as thought for other languages or thought in nonlinguistic tasks.
Second, comparing studies conducted in different languages poses a deeper problem: there is simply no way to be certain that the stimuli and instructions are truly the same in both languages. This problem remains

Sex, Syntax, and Semantics 67
even if the verbal instructions are minimal. For example, even if the task is nonlinguistic, and participants are asked simply their language’s equivalent of ‘‘Which one is the same?’’, one cannot be sure that the words used for ‘‘same’’ mean the same thing in both languages. If in one language the word for ‘‘same’’ is closer in meaning to ‘‘identical,’’ while in the other language it is closer to ‘‘relationally similar,’’ speakers of different languages may behave differently, but only because of the difference in instructions, not because of any interesting differences in thought. There is no sure way to guard against this possibility when tasks are translated into different languages. Since there is no way to know that participants tested in different languages are performing the same task, it is difﬁcult to deem the comparisons meaningful.
Finally, in all of the tasks described so far, participants were asked to provide some subjective judgment (there were no right or wrong answers). Providing such a judgment requires participants to decide on a strategy for completing the task. When ﬁguring out how to perform the task, participants may simply make a conscious decision to follow the grammatical gender divisions in their language. Evidence collected from such subjective judgments cannot reveal whether gender is actually part of a person’s conceptual representation of an object, or whether (left with no other criterion for making the subjective judgment) the person just explicitly decided to use grammatical gender in answering the experimenter’s questions.
Showing that experience with a language affects thought in some broader sense (other than thinking for that particular language) requires observing a crosslinguistic difference on some more covert measure in a non-language-speciﬁc task. The studies described in this chapter do just that. People are tested in tasks where the purpose of the experiment is covert or where the task requires participants to provide a correct answer (i.e., not a subjective judgment). Further, Spanish and German speakers are tested in English (and sometimes in nonlinguistic tasks), allowing us to assess the effects of people’s native language on their thinking more generally (not just thinking for that same language). Finally, a series of studies shows that crosslinguistic differences in thought can be produced just by grammatical differences and in the absence of other cultural factors.

68 Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips
So, does talking about inanimate objects as if they were masculine or feminine actually lead people to think of inanimate objects as having a gender? Could the grammatical genders assigned to objects by a language inﬂuence people’s mental representations of objects?
4.5 Grammatical Gender and Memory
To investigate this, Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips (2002) taught a group of Spanish and German speakers proper names for 24 objects (e.g., an apple may have been called Patrick) and then tested their memory for these object-name pairs. The experiment was conducted entirely in English, and all objects were chosen to have opposite grammatical genders in Spanish and German. For both Spanish and German speakers, half of the time the gender of the proper name assigned to an object was consistent with the grammatical gender of the object’s name (in their native language), and half of the time it was inconsistent. All of the participants were native speakers of either Spanish or German, but both groups were highly proﬁcient in English.
The prediction was that German speakers would be better at remembering a proper name for ‘‘apple’’ if the name was Patrick than if it was Patricia, and the opposite should be true for Spanish speakers (because the word for ‘‘apple’’ is masculine in German, but feminine in Spanish). As predicted, Spanish and German speakers’ memory for object-name pairs (e.g., apple-Patricia) was better for pairs where the gender of the proper name was consistent with the grammatical gender of the object name (in their native language) than when the two genders were inconsistent. Since theobject names used in this study had opposite grammatical genders in Spanish and German, Spanish and German speakers showed opposite memory biases: for those objects for which Spanish speakers were most likely to remember female names, German speakers were most likely to remember male names (and vice versa). Further, a group of native English speakers (similar in age and education to the Spanish and German speakers) were tested in the same task. They were able to correctly remember the object-name pairs as well as Spanish and German speakers did for consistent pairs, and better than they did for inconsistent pairs. This suggests that Spanish and German speakers’

Sex, Syntax, and Semantics 69
previous language experience actually interfered with their ability to remember object-name pairs when the pairs happened to be conceptually inconsistent in gender. Since both groups performed the task in English, it appears that the semantic representation of gender (once it has been established) is not language speciﬁc. Objects do appear to have conceptual gender, and this gender is consistent with the grammatical gender assigned by language.
But what does it mean for a turnip to be conceptually feminine or for a toaster to be conceptually masculine? How does gender actually make its way into the representations of objects? As suggested earlier, one possibility is that, depending on grammatical gender, different (stereotypically masculine or feminine) aspects of objects may become more or less salient in the representations of those objects. For example, if the noun that names a toaster is masculine, then perhaps its metallic and technological properties may become more salient; but if the noun is feminine, then perhaps its warmth, domesticity, and ability to provide nourishment are given more importance.
4.6 Grammatical Gender and Object Descriptions
To test whether grammatical gender really does focus speakers of different languages on different aspects of objects, Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips (2002) created a list of 24 object names that had opposite grammatical genders in Spanish and German (half were masculine and half feminine in each language), and then asked a group of native Spanish speakers and another group of native German speakers to write down the ﬁrst three adjectives that came to mind to describe each object on the list. The study was conducted entirely in English, and none of the participants were aware of the purpose of the study. The question was whether the grammatical genders of object names in Spanish and German would be reﬂected in the kinds of adjectives that Spanish and German speakers generated. All of the participants were native speakers of either Spanish or German, but both groups were highly proﬁcient in English. Since the experiment was conducted entirely in English (a language with no grammatical gender system), this is a particularly conservative test of whether grammatical gender inﬂuences the way people think about objects.

70 Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips
After all of the adjectives provided by Spanish and German speakers were collected, a group of English speakers (unaware of the purpose of the study) rated the adjectives as describing masculine or feminine properties of the objects (þ1 ¼ feminine, À1 ¼ masculine). The adjectives were arranged in alphabetical order and were not identiﬁed as having been produced by a Spanish or a German speaker.
As predicted, Spanish and German speakers generated adjectives that were rated more masculine for items whose names were grammatically masculine in their native language than for items whose names were grammatically feminine. Because all object names used in this study had opposite genders in Spanish and German, Spanish and German speakers produced very different adjectives to describe the objects. For items that were grammatically masculine in Spanish but feminine in German, adjectives provided by Spanish speakers were rated more masculine than those provided by German speakers. For items that were grammatically masculine in German but feminine in Spanish, adjectives provided by German speakers were rated more masculine than those provided by Spanish speakers.
There were also observable qualitative differences between the kinds of adjectives Spanish and German speakers produced. For example, the word for ‘‘key’’ is masculine in German and feminine in Spanish. German speakers described keys as hard, heavy, jagged, metal, serrated, and useful, while Spanish speakers said they were golden, intricate, little, lovely, shiny, and tiny. The word for ‘‘bridge,’’ on the other hand, is feminine in German and masculine in Spanish. German speakers described bridges as beautiful, elegant, fragile, peaceful, pretty, and slender, while Spanish speakers said they were big, dangerous, long, strong, sturdy, and towering.
These ﬁndings once again indicate that people’s thinking about objects is inﬂuenced by the grammatical genders their native language assigns to the objects’ names. A further question is whether differences in language per se lead to differences in thought, or whether other cultural differences act as intermediary causal factors. For example, the way objects are personiﬁed in fairy tales or in poetry may depend on the grammatical genders of their names. Further, grammatical genders might affect the design

Sex, Syntax, and Semantics 71
of artifacts such that German bridges may differ from Spanish bridges in a way consistent with grammatical gender.
4.7 Separating Effects of Language and Culture
To test whether grammatical gender in a language can indeed exert a causal power over thought (without intermediary cultural factors), Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips (2002) taught native English speakers about a soupative/oosative distinction in the ﬁctional Gumbuzi language. Participants were shown drawings of 4 males and 4 females along with 12 inanimate objects and were taught which would be soupative (preceded by sou) and which oosative (preceded by oos) in Gumbuzi. The soupative/oosative distinction always corresponded to biological gender (all females were in one category and all males in the other) but also extended to inanimate objects. A given subject might have learned that pans, forks, pencils, ballerinas, and girls are soupative, while pots, spoons, pens, giants, and boys are oosative. Which objects were designated as grammatically masculine and which feminine was counterbalanced across subjects such that each object was assigned to the same grammatical category as biological females for half of the subjects, and assigned to the same grammatical category as males for the other half.
After subjects had mastered the oosative/soupative distinction, they were shown all the pictures again one at a time (unlabeled) and asked to generate adjectives to describe the objects. These adjectives were then independently rated as depicting masculine or feminine properties of the objects.
As predicted, English speakers produced more masculine adjectives to describe objects when they (i.e., their names) belonged to a grammatical category with biological males than when the same objects belonged to a grammatical category with biological females. Just as with the Spanish and German speakers, there was also an observable qualitative difference between the adjectives produced for an item when it was grammatically grouped with males than when it was grouped with females. For example, when the violin was grammatically feminine in Gumbuzi, English speakers described a picture of a violin as artsy, beautiful, beautiful,

72 Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips
creative, curvy, delicate, elegant, interesting, pretty, and wooden. When it was grammatically masculine, English speakers described it as chirping, difﬁcult, impressive, noisy, overused, piercing, shiny, slender, voluptuous, and wooden. It appears that just differences in grammar, with no concomitant differences in culture, are enough to inﬂuence how people think about objects.
These ﬁndings suggest that people’s ideas about the genders of objects can indeed be inﬂuenced by the grammatical genders assigned to those objects in a language. But all of the studies described so far have included some linguistic component in the tasks (albeit the linguistic component was in a language other than the one producing the effects). Subjects were asked either to remember names for objects or to produce adjectives in response to words or pictures. Could grammatical gender have an effect even if no words were used in a study?
4.8 Grammatical Gender and Picture Similarity
Several recent studies have investigated the effects of grammatical gender in tasks involving no words, only pictures (Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips 2002). In one study, Spanish and German speakers rated the similarity of pairs of unlabeled pictures depicting objects and people. All of the objects were chosen to have opposite grammatical genders in Spanish and German, and the picture of each object was compared to pictures of several biological males and females. Even in this nonlinguistic task (involving no labels and no verbalization in any language), Spanish and German speakers produced similarity ratings consistent with the gender assignments of their native language. Both Spanish and German speakers rated an object more similar to a person when the grammatical gender of the object matched the biological gender of the person than when the genders did not match. This was true even though participants were instructed and tested in English and all of the objects had opposite grammatical genders in Spanish and German. The same differences were obtained even when Spanish and German speakers made their similarity judgments while performing a verbal interference task (shadowing randomly generated letter strings).

Sex, Syntax, and Semantics 73
Further, a group of Spanish/German bilinguals was tested in the same task. The degree to which a subject’s pattern of similarity scores corresponded to either the Spanish or the German grammatical gender system was well predicted by that person’s relative skill in Spanish versus German as well as by other aspects of linguistic experience such as whether the person was born in a Spanish- or German-speaking country, how much earlier the person started learning one language versus the other, and how many years the person had spoken the two languages.
In another set of studies, English speakers were taught the Gumbuzi oosative/soupative grammatical distinctions as described earlier, and were then asked to rate the similarity of pairs of pictures depicting people and objects that were either in the same grammatical category or in different grammatical categories in Gumbuzi. Just as was observed with Spanish and German speakers, pairs of items that were in the same grammatical category were rated more similar than items that came from different grammatical categories. Just as before, the effects did not go away when subjects made the similarity ratings while performing a verbal interference task. These ﬁndings once again suggest that learning new grammatical categories can shape the way people think about objects (in this case demonstrated as an increase in the perceived similarity of pictures).
4.9 But How Does Language Affect Thought?
Beyond demonstrating that learning linguistic categories can affect people’s descriptions of objects or similarity ratings, it is important to consider how learning such categories can have this effect. One possibility is that in order to make sense of the grammatical categories they encounter in language (or in the laboratory), people deliberately look for similarities between items assigned to the same grammatical category. If a meaningful and consistent set of similarities is discovered, these similarities can then be stored (or perhaps the features that are relevant to the similarity can be made more salient in the representation). This would explain both the increased within-category similarity (Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips 2002) and the bias in descriptions observed in the

74 Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips
earlier studies. This type of mechanism is supported by recent ﬁndings suggesting that comparison leads to an increase in similarity (so long as the items being compared make it possible to discover meaningful similarities) (Boroditsky 2002; see also Gentner and Namy 1999; Loewenstein and Gentner 1998).
However, there might also be a more mundane explanation for all this. Perhaps people give higher similarity ratings to items assigned to the same grammatical category not because they have discovered or highlighted their similarities, but simply because these items share a new common feature—the name of the category they belong to. That is, maybe just the fact that both items are called ‘‘oosative’’ or ‘‘soupative’’ is enough to produce the increase in within-category similarity. To test this explanation, Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips (2002) taught a new group of subjects a new variation on the oosative/soupative distinction in Gumbuzi. Instead of being based on biological gender (thus making it possible to carry out a meaningful set of consistent comparisons), the categories were made arbitrary with regard to gender. Unlike the old Gumbuzi categories that included either 4 instances of males or 4 instances of females, the new arbitrary categories included a mix of males and females in each category. As before, subjects were trained until they could categorize the objects perfectly into oosative and soupative, and then they were asked to rate similarity between pairs of pictures that were either in the same category or in different categories. Although these subjects had the same proﬁciency with the categories as the subjects in the old studies, and although (just as before) all objects in a category shared the same category name (oosative or soupative), there was no increase in similarity for within-category comparisons. It appears that (at least in these studies) just sharing a category name is not sufﬁcient to signiﬁcantly increase the similarity between two objects. Only when a category is meaningful, somehow interpretable beyond rote memorization, does the similarity of items within a category increase.
So it appears that linguistic categories can inﬂuence people’s thinking by encouraging them to carry out comparisons that they wouldn’t have otherwise carried out (or perhaps wouldn’t have carried out as often or with the same goals in mind). In the process of carrying out these comparisons, people may discover meaningful similarities between objects or

Sex, Syntax, and Semantics 75
perhaps make comparison-relevant features more salient in the representations. Clearly, many parts of this proposal remain to be speciﬁed and tested. One prediction made by this view is that after learning a meaningful category, people should be faster and/or better able to name similarities between category members because they have already carried out the comparisons and may have stored the similarities. Some preliminary evidence suggests that this is indeed the case (Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips 2002). After being taught the Gumbuzi oosative/soupative categories (the gender-based versions), subjects were asked to name similarities between as many person-object pairs as they could in a period of ﬁve minutes (a time period far too short to complete all pairs). Answers such as oosative, soupative, masculine, and feminine were excluded from all analyses (only ﬁve of these were produced across all subjects). When the pairs consisted of items from the same category, people were able to generate more similarities than when the pairs contained items from different categories. These ﬁndings suggest that learning to group objects into meaningful categories does encourage the discovery or at least the highlighting of their similarities.
4.10 So, Does Language Shape Thought?
The results reviewed in this chapter demonstrate that a grammatical distinction in language has the power to bias people’s memory, their descriptions of words and pictures, their assessments of picture similarities, and their ability to generate similarities between pictures. This is true even though people perform tasks in a language different from the one they learned the distinction in, perform tasks involving no words (just pictures), or perform tasks where the point of the experiment is covert (e.g., the adjectives task). Previous evidence also suggests that the same grammatical distinction affects people’s decision making (e.g., assigning voices to animated characters), personiﬁcation of nouns (as in the Russian days of the week), and ratings of object characteristics (e.g., potency). In short, speakers of different languages behave differently in a host of tests in ways that are consistent with the distinctions made in their language. But does all this evidence mean that language affects thought? In particular, does it mean that linguistic categories

76 Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips
(e.g., a noun’s being grammatically feminine or masculine) actually alter nonlinguistic representations? Perhaps linguistic categories simply get recruited covertly for all these tasks, so even though speakers of different languages may exhibit different patterns in behavior, linguistic and nonlinguistic representations remain truly separate, and everybody’s nonlinguistic representations are in fact the same.
This is an interesting possibility, and a difﬁcult one to rule out empirically. For example, Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips (2002) attempted to disable people’s linguistic faculties by asking them to shadow speech while they performed the similarity-rating tasks described earlier. If effects of grammatical gender disappeared under these conditions, then we might have been able to infer that grammatical categories had not affected nonlinguistic representations. Instead, it would seem that language affected thinking in this case because people covertly invoked linguistic representations in a set of seemingly nonlinguistic tasks. But it turned out that tying up the linguistic faculties had no effect on the results (the effects of grammatical gender were equally strong when subjects were shadowing speech as when they were not). Can we now conclude that grammatical gender deﬁnitely does affect people’s nonlinguistic representations? This seems premature. Perhaps the shadowing task simply did not disable all of the aspects of language that could have been covertly recruited for the task. Perhaps some different, more complex verbal interference task would have changed the results. Several other tasks could be tried, but as long as the verbal interference does not get rid of the effect of language on thought, there will always be doubt about whether or not all of the necessary linguistic faculties were properly interfered with. There seems to be no sure way to disable all linguistic processes (and this is in no small part due to the difﬁculty of deciding on what counts as linguistic and nonlinguistic processing in the ﬁrst place).
Fortunately, being able to discriminate between these two possibilities is not necessary here. Regardless of which possibility is correct, it appears that language plays an important role in thinking. Whether people’s native language is covertly involved in all manner of seemingly nonlinguistic tasks (even despite verbal interference, in nonlinguistic tasks, and in tasks conducted in other languages), or whether aspects of grammar are able to inﬂuence nonlinguistic representations directly, it

Sex, Syntax, and Semantics 77
appears that thinking involves a collaboration between many different linguistic and nonlinguistic representations and processes. This means that the private mental lives of speakers of different languages may differ dramatically—and not only when they are thinking for speaking their particular language, but in all manner of cognitive tasks.
4.11 Conclusions
A body of evidence suggests that people’s thinking about objects can be inﬂuenced by aspects of grammar that differ across languages. A series of studies found effects of grammatical gender on people’s descriptions of objects, their assessments of similarity between pictures of objects, and their ability to remember proper names for objects. Another set of studies showed that differences in thought can be produced just by grammatical differences and in the absence of other cultural factors. It is striking that even a ﬂuke of grammar (the arbitrary designation of a noun as masculine or feminine) can have an effect on how people think about things in the world. Considering the many ways in which languages differ, our ﬁndings suggest that the private mental lives of people who speak different languages may differ much more than previously thought.
Notes
This research was funded by an NSF Graduate Research Fellowship to the ﬁrst author. Partial support was also provided by NIMH research grant MH-47575 to Gordon Bower. We would like to thank Michael Ramscar, Herbert H. Clark, Eve Clark, Barbara Tversky, Gordon Bower, Dan Slobin, and Steven Pinker for helpful comments on earlier versions of the chapter and insightful discussions of this research, and Jill M. Schmidt for her indispensable work in assembling the stimuli. 1. Despite wide variation in the assignment of grammatical genders, speakers across languages do share some common beliefs about the genders of objects. For example, when asked to classify names or pictures of objects into masculine and feminine, English and Spanish speakers tend to judge natural objects as more feminine and artifacts as more masculine (Mullen 1990; Sera, Berge, and del Castillo 1994). It is also interesting that English speakers make consistent judgments about the genders of objects, despite the lack of a grammatical gender system in English (Sera, Berge, and del Castillo 1994). Finally, English speakers’

78 Boroditsky, Schmidt, and Phillips
intuitions about the genders of animals correspond well with the grammatical genders assigned to those animals’ names in Spanish, German, and Russian (Boroditsky and Schmidt 2000). Clearly, further studies involving non-IndoEuropean languages are necessary to assess the generality of these ﬁndings.

Speaking versus Thinking about Objects and Actions
Barbara C. Malt, Steven A. Sloman, and Silvia P. Gennari
5.1 Introduction
A strong version of the Whorﬁan hypothesis is that the inﬂuence of language on thought is obligatory or at least habitual; that is, thought is always, or under most circumstances, guided by language. This version is reﬂected in proposals such as that a person whose language does not include a subjunctive tense will have trouble thinking counterfactually (Bloom 1981); that a person whose language highlights speciﬁc qualities of a named object with a classiﬁer particle will notice those qualities more (Carroll and Casagrande 1958); that a person whose language has only a few color terms will discriminate colors less well than someone whose language has more color terms (Brown and Lenneberg 1954); that a person whose language uses vertical metaphors to talk about time will think about time differently than someone whose language uses horizontal metaphors (Boroditsky 1999). In all these cases, it is assumed that the nonlinguistic cognitive processes of a person who speaks a particular language are closely and habitually, if not inextricably, linked to the form or content of the language.
Other versions, however, suggest different forms of the relation between language and thought. Slobin (1996a), for instance, suggests that language inﬂuences thought primarily in ‘‘thinking for speaking’’; that is, language will inﬂuence the processing of an event when talking about it because language forces a segmentation of the event compatible with the devices the language has for expressing it. Others have variously suggested that language may provide a means of integrating sources of information that cannot be integrated in other representational systems

82 Malt, Sloman, and Gennari
(Hermer-Vazquez, Spelke, and Katsnelson 1999), that language provides a source of information that can be drawn on in decision making (Kay and Kempton 1984), or that language helps encode information in and retrieve it from memory ([Rosch] Heider 1972; Heider and Olivier 1972). In all cases, language inﬂuences thought but only under speciﬁc and limited circumstances.
In keeping with such views, we suggest that at the lexical level, language and thought need not closely or commonly mirror each other. On the linguistic side, naming—of objects, events, or other entities—is a communicative process and is therefore sensitive to inﬂuences such as a language’s history and the particular history of a speaker and addressee. The vocabulary of each language changes over time and is shaped by a variety of forces such as cultural needs, contact with other languages, and sound changes, which drive meaning shifts including broadening, narrowing, differentiation, and reinterpretation of individual word meanings, and which can add words to or delete words from the language’s lexicon (e.g., Hock and Joseph 1996; Keller 1994). Such factors contribute to how many choices of names for an entity a speaker has and which is dominant. Speakers must also choose a name, out of the possible names, that they know their addressee will be able to use to pick out the intended referent. This choice must take into account the addressee’s knowledge base, what the addressee will assume the speaker knows he or she knows, and speciﬁc shared experiences in which speaker and addressee may have established a use of a particular term to pick out a particular kind of object (e.g., Brennan and Clark 1996; Clark 1996; Clark and Wilkes-Gibbs 1986). Speakers must also assess the situation to determine the level of speciﬁcity needed and choose a name that will convey as much information as is needed but not more (Brown 1958; Grice 1975). What name a person uses for an entity on any particular occasion is thus inﬂuenced by the set of names his or her language makes available for that domain and the pattern of application of names to entities that the language has evolved, by the goals of the particular communication, and by the common ground of the speaker and addressee.
On the nonlinguistic side, though, these inﬂuences are not directly relevant to the general conceptual system and the various processes that

Speaking versus Thinking 83
draw on it. The encoding in and retrieval of information from memory, the use of the information in problem solving and decision making, the perception of similarity among entities, the classiﬁcation of a new entity by recognizing its relation to some set of familiar entities, and so on, are not in themselves about communication. There is no functional reason why the encoding or use of information about entities by a single individual in a noncommunicative context must be sensitive to language history, Gricean considerations, or shared linguistic knowledge between sets of individuals. Thus, the potential exists for naming and nonlinguistic processes to proceed without a direct and obligatory or habitual inﬂuence of the ﬁrst on the second.
Of course, it is possible that the names are indirectly but powerfully relevant to nonlinguistic processes. Much work at the lexical level (e.g., the early work on color names; see also Boroditsky 1999; Levinson 1996a,b) has hypothesized that they are. This work has assumed that in some way, the names that people give entities permanently or habitually inﬂuence how they encode, retrieve, compare (etc.) those entities. However, the mechanisms supporting such an inﬂuence remain unspeciﬁed. To take the case of color terms, the version of the hypothesis in which the inﬂuence of language on thought is obligatory and permanent—the version that drove the classic research on color (see Lucy 1992, 1996)— suggests that a language’s color vocabulary somehow determines color perception: the colors actually look different to people with different color vocabularies. Consideration of possible mechanisms for such an effect suggests, though, that this is a priori not likely. Such a mechanism would violate virtually all theories of color perception; phenomena such as color constancy have been modeled by focusing exclusively on the optical array generated by a three-dimensional conﬁguration of a scene. It seems likely that any effect of color names on performance in color tasks must come from higher processes. For instance, the number of named values on a dimension might inﬂuence the amount of attention to that dimension or might create richer or poorer retrieval cues for the colors in a memory task. If a person speaks a language that names only ‘‘light’’ versus ‘‘dark,’’ he or she may pay less attention to hue variation than someone whose language has contrastive names for more of the hue continuum, and so that person may perform poorly when asked to pick

84 Malt, Sloman, and Gennari
out a previously presented color from an array of color chips. Likewise, a person whose language has few color names may be less able to use names as a way to help remember the hue of a color. In either case, when working with colors that are physically present, the person may be no less able to discriminate among them than someone with a richer color vocabulary.
This brief consideration of speciﬁc mechanisms for a linguistic inﬂuence on color perception suggests an effect of names on performance in color tasks but a limit on the nature of the possible inﬂuence. The available empirical evidence is consistent with this suggestion (Berlin and Kay 1969; Kay and McDaniel 1978; though see Roberson, Davies, and Davidoff 2000). These ﬁndings raise the possibility that a mirroring relation in the domain of color is not obligatory, and perhaps not even habitual, but may depend on task-processing demands. (See also Jackendoff and Landau 1991 and Hermer-Vazquez, Spelke, and Katsnelson 1999 on the relation of task demands to language-mediated responses in the domain of spatial cognition and spatial terms.) We propose that a useful step for thinking about the relation of naming to thought more generally is likewise to put forward assumptions about the nature of linguistic and nonlinguistic representations and the processes that operate on them. Doing so makes it possible to generate hypotheses about when an inﬂuence of language on thought should be found and when it should not.
Our assumptions are as follows (Malt et al. 1999). At the conceptual level, entities (objects, events, etc.) are represented as points in multidimensional feature space. They tend to form clusters in this space (Rosch and Mervis 1975). No ﬁxed boundaries separate these clusters, and so conceptual categories are only implicitly deﬁned. Further, the clusters formed may vary depending on feature weightings imposed by different contexts and task demands (Medin, Goldstone, and Gentner 1993), so there is no ﬁxed conceptual structure. At the linguistic level, names are associated with points in the space with varying degrees of strength, with the strength of the name generally varying in proportion to the similarity of the entity to other entities in a cluster. Because names are explicitly represented, the linguistic categories are explicit, although their boundaries are fuzzy.

Speaking versus Thinking 85
Under these assumptions, the probability that an entity is called by a given name will generally reﬂect its centrality to a cluster of entities associated with the name. However, additional complexity in how names are chosen can arise in several ways. We assume that similarity is exemplar based (e.g., Brooks 1978, 1987; Medin and Schaffer 1978). This type of similarity metric allows that chains of entities sharing a common name may come into existence such that entities at one end of a chain may have few features in common with those at the other end (Heit 1992; Lakoff 1987). In addition, the association mechanism allows experience with names for entities to alter the strength of association of a name with that entity, independent of the similarity of the entity to other entities associated with the name.
We have previously suggested that crosslinguistic variation in naming patterns for artifacts (Malt et al. 1999; Sloman, Malt, and Fridman 2001) will arise because (1) since different artifacts enter different cultures at different times, the exemplar-based similarity processes will produce different patterns as a given language extends its set of names to new exemplars, and (2) non-similarity-based inﬂuences on naming such as a marketer’s motivation to bestow one name or another will add to the crosslinguistic diversity. Our simple model suggests that crosslinguistic variation in naming patterns will exist even for domains that are more constant in their instantiation across cultures (e.g., color, motion, and space). These domains are like artifacts in that their linguistic categories are not assigned from scratch by each new speaker of the language, but are transmitted across generations of speakers. If cultures have either random starting points or motivated variation in which entities they ﬁrst attend to and name, phenomena similar to those for artifacts may occur as a result of the exemplar-based categorization process. A culture names certain points in space and then extends these names in various ways or introduces new names depending on what else needs to be named and what other things are similar within the set already named. The result will be that different cultures will generate different clusters and chains of entities sharing names. As with artifacts, non-similarity-based processes may also inﬂuence names within these domains. Cultural need or lack of need to distinguish sets of entities as the language continues to evolve is itself a non-similarity-based inﬂuence, and contact with other languages

86 Malt, Sloman, and Gennari
may inﬂuence how many different names are available for linguistic discrimination within a domain. Thus, naming patterns even for domains that are universal in human experience are likely to show crosslinguistic variation.
In contrast, conceptual groupings are not transmitted from generation to generation in our view, but are formed to serve the demands of a particular task and are based on perception of features relevant to that situation. Of course, conceptual knowledge is culturally transmitted, but this knowledge is not about groupings per se; rather, it is about the nature of speciﬁc objects or types of objects. In those cases where cultures differ in their understanding of the nature of objects, groupings formed by perceivers of the objects from different cultures may vary correspondingly. However, we suggest that the understanding of most everyday entities is determined largely by features such as size and shape, functional role (for artifacts), behavior (for animals), and so on, that are perceived similarly by members of most or all cultures (see, e.g., Berlin 1992; Hunn 1997; Malt 1995 on cross-cultural similarities in classiﬁcation of plants and animals). We therefore hypothesize that conceptual groupings of entities, as opposed to linguistic ones, will tend to be universal and independent of the naming pattern used by a particular language.
Given that conceptual knowledge has names linked to it, though, and names serve to indicate linguistic category boundaries, we must consider whether differences in the patterns of names for speakers of different languages lead to differences in the representation of the entities in conceptual space—thereby answering the question of the relation between conceptual and linguistic clusters by indicating an enduring distortion of the conceptual space to reﬂect linguistic categories, as proposed in strong versions of the Whorﬁan hypothesis. Our assumption that there are no ﬁxed boundaries or clusters in conceptual space, but only those created by the demands of a particular context, suggests that there is not, and that there is no single answer to the question of the relation between concepts and linguistic categories. Tasks that activate names along with nonlinguistic information are likely to show inﬂuences of name similarity on response patterns because the names, in this case, are part of the information available to draw on in executing the task. The names them-

Speaking versus Thinking 87
selves may also feed back to the conceptual feature space to activate certain features more than others (e.g., in feature induction; Gelman 1988). But given that people differentially weight features depending on context and task demand, and that names are only one piece of information among many, our assumptions suggest that when the task does not activate names, universal responses can be found.
Our working model thus suggests the following predictions about crosslinguistic variability in naming and its relation to nonlinguistic knowledge and task performance: (1) Crosslinguistic variability will exist in naming patterns across a wide range of domains. (2) Conceptual knowledge is not necessarily closely tied to linguistic categories; it may be universal. (3) Nevertheless, all domains potentially will show an inﬂuence of linguistic categorization on performance in nonlinguistic tasks. Speciﬁcally, linguistic categorization will inﬂuence performance of linguistically mediated tasks; no such inﬂuence will occur if the task context does not explicitly invoke names or if names do not provide a useful basis for decisions.
We now summarize two studies that test our predictions. The ﬁrst, discussed in more detail in Malt et al. 1999, examines naming and similarity judgments for a set of containers by speakers of English, Spanish, and Chinese. We test both whether naming varies across cultures and whether similarity judgments are inﬂuenced by naming differences or are the same across cultures. The second study, discussed in more detail in Gennari et al. 2002, takes as a starting point an analysis of verbs of motion that establishes linguistic differences in how simple actions are lexicalized in Spanish versus English. We use this difference to ask whether the linguistic differences produce habitual differences in the perception of similarity and the storage in memory of simple motion events.
5.2 Artifacts
Casual observation suggests that names for some artifacts in a given language do diverge from what the object’s features, by themselves, would dictate as the likely name for the object. For instance, a plastic container for holding drinks, having a straw and in the shape of Mickey Mouse, can be called a water bottle, but a plastic container for holding

88 Malt, Sloman, and Gennari
drinks, having a straw and in the shape of a bear, can be called a juice box (see ﬁgures 2 and 3 in Malt et al. 1999). Neither resembles the usual appearance of things called bottle or box; only the bottle has the usual function of its namesake; and the two are similar enough in physical and functional features that it is hard to see how the features alone would result in different names for the two. The labels standardly given to these objects seem to be inﬂuenced by the history of what other objects they evolved from and what the manufacturer wanted to convey to consumers about possible uses through the name. If each culture has its own history of human-made objects and names for them, then differences across languages in naming patterns are likely to arise. Anecdotal evidence likewise supports this idea; for instance, Americans call a stuffed easy chair and a wooden kitchen chair by the same name, but Chinese give the stuffed seat the same name as sofas. In addition, Kronenfeld, Armstrong, and Wilmoth (1985), looking at 11 drinking vessels, found that Americans, Japanese, and Israelis grouped the vessels by name in different ways.
The ﬁrst goal of this study was thus to see whether such crosslinguistic diversity in naming patterns would show up in a domain other than that used by Kronenfeld, Armstrong, and Wilmoth and under more systematic examination of names for a much larger set of objects. Given such diversity, we could then ask the second question: would groups of people who have different naming patterns for the objects show differences in their perception of similarity among the objects? If similarity and naming are closely linked, then they should. In contrast, if naming and similarity are dissociable, then speakers of languages with different name boundaries might nevertheless provide comparable similarity judgments.
5.2.1 Method The materials consisted of a set of 60 photographs of ordinary objects found in homes, grocery and drug stores, and so on. They represented as wide a range of objects likely to be called bottle or jar in English as we could ﬁnd (e.g., an aspirin bottle, a baby bottle, a peanut butter jar, a mustard jar), along with some others not likely to be called by those names but sharing substantial properties with them (e.g., a milk jug, a margarine tub). Figure 5.1 illustrates three stimulus objects; see also ﬁgure 5 of Malt et al. 1999. The range of objects allowed us to
