Preface to the Second Edition
In the past six to ten years the theory of conceptual metaphor has become the most inﬂuential and widely used theory of metaphor. Some of the new developments can be found in such diverse areas of research as
the neural theory of metaphor the theory of conceptual integration metaphor in discourse the relationship between embodiment and metaphor the embeddedness of metaphor in cultural context the nature of mappings metaphor in gestures the study of multimodal metaphor metaphor identiﬁcation metaphor processing the corpus linguistic study of metaphor emotion metaphors the theory of metonymy metaphor in foreign language teaching metaphor in the study of grammar and others.
All of these areas are now discussed in this second edition of Metaphor: A Practical Introduction, and two of them, the embodiment of emotion metaphors and metaphor in discourse, have received their own independent chapters. The two new chapters are chapter 8, “Cognitive Models, Metaphors, and Embodiment,” and chapter 18, “Metaphor in Discourse.” In the last chapter of the book, by studying a single example, I have made an attempt to investigate the relationships among various strands of what is commonly called “conceptual metaphor theory.”
I have also tried to update the literature throughout as fully as I could. In addition, all ﬁgures have been redrawn, thus providing the reader with a

more uniform, more esthetically pleasing, and more illuminating visual representation of sometimes complex ideas.
Last but not least, dozens of new exercises have been added to the old ones, we hope, making the book even more “user-friendly” and more fun to study from.
At the same time, however, several of the new additions reﬂect exciting, often challenging, and sometimes controversial recent research ﬁndings that, at least my hope is, give food for thought not only for interested students but also for researchers and teachers alike.

Preface to the First Edition:
The Study of Metaphor
For most of us, metaphor is a ﬁgure of speech in which one thing is compared with another by saying that one is the other, as in He is a lion. Or, as the Encyclopaedia Britannica puts it: “metaphor [is a] ﬁgure of speech that implies comparison between two unlike entities, as distinguished from simile, an explicit comparison signalled by the words ‘like’ or ‘as’ ” [emphases in the original]. For example, we would consider the word lion to be a metaphor in the sentence “Achilles was a lion in the ﬁght.” We would probably also say that the word is used metaphorically in order to achieve some artistic and rhetorical effect, since we speak and write metaphorically to communicate eloquently, to impress others with “beautiful,” esthetically pleasing words, or to express some deep emotion. Perhaps we would also add that what makes the metaphorical identiﬁcation of Achilles with a lion possible is that Achilles and lions have something in common: namely, their bravery and strength.
Indeed, this is a widely shared view—the most common conception of metaphor, both in scholarly circles and in the popular mind (which is not to say that this is the only view of metaphor). This traditional concept can be brieﬂy characterized by pointing out ﬁve of its most commonly accepted features. First, metaphor is a property of words; it is a linguistic phenomenon. The metaphorical use of lion is a characteristic of a linguistic expression (that of the word lion). Second, metaphor is used for some artistic and rhetorical purpose, such as when Shakespeare writes “all the world’s a stage.” Third, metaphor is based on a resemblance between the two entities that are compared and identiﬁed. Achilles must share some features with lions in order for us to be able to use the word lion as a metaphor for Achilles. Fourth, metaphor is a conscious and deliberate use of words, and you must have a special talent to be able to do it and do it well. Only great poets or eloquent speakers, such as, say, Shakespeare and Churchill, can be its masters. For instance, Aristotle makes the following statement to this effect: “The greatest

x PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION: THE STUDY OF METAPHOR
thing by far is to have command of metaphor. This alone cannot be imparted by another; it is the mark of genius.” Fifth, it is also commonly held that metaphor is a ﬁgure of speech that we can do without; we use it for special effects, and it is not an inevitable part of everyday human communication, let alone everyday human thought and reasoning.
A new view of metaphor that challenged all these aspects of the powerful traditional theory in a coherent and systematic way was ﬁrst developed by George Lakoff and Mark Johnson in 1980 in their seminal study: Metaphors We Live By. Their conception has become known as the “cognitive linguistic view of metaphor.” Lakoff and Johnson challenged the deeply entrenched view of metaphor by claiming that (1) metaphor is a property of concepts, and not of words; (2) the function of metaphor is to better understand certain concepts, and not just some artistic or esthetic purpose; (3) metaphor is often not based on similarity; (4) metaphor is used effortlessly in everyday life by ordinary people, not just by special talented people; and (5) metaphor, far from being a superﬂuous though pleasing linguistic ornament, is an inevitable process of human thought and reasoning.
Lakoff and Johnson showed convincingly that metaphor is pervasive both in thought and everyday language. Their insight has been taken up by recent dictionary preparers as well. For instance, Collins Cobuild English Guides 7: Metaphor (cited as the Collins Cobuild metaphor dictionary in this volume) has examples of metaphors, such as the following (metaphorical expressions in the example sentences or phrases are italicized):
(1) He was an animal on Saturday afternoon and is a disgrace to British football.
(2) There is no painless way to get inﬂation down. We now have an excellent foundation on which to build.
(3) Politicians are being blamed for the ills of society. (4) The machinery of democracy could be created quickly but its spirit
was just as important. (5) Government grants have enabled a number of the top names in
British sport to build a successful career. (6) . . . a local branch of this organization. (7) Few of them have the qualiﬁcations . . . to put an ailing company
back on its feet. (8) The Service will continue to stagger from crisis to crisis. (9) Her career was in ruins. (10) How could any man ever understand the workings of a woman’s
mind? (11) Scientists have taken a big step in understanding Alzheimer’s disease. (12) They selectively pruned the workforce. (13) . . . cultivating business relationships that can lead to major accounts. (14) The coffee was perfect and by the time I was halfway through my
ﬁrst cup my brain was ticking over much more briskly. (15) Let’s hope he can keep the team on the road to success. (16) Everyone says what a happy, sunny girl she was. (17) It’s going to be a bitch to replace him.

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION: THE STUDY OF METAPHOR xi
(18) The province is quite close to sliding into civil war. (19) They remembered her as she’d been in the ﬂower of their friendship. (20) Vincent met his father’s icy stare evenly. (21) With its economy in ruins, it can’t afford to involve itself in military
action. (22) . . . French sex kitten Brigitte Bardot.
Some of these examples would be considered by most people to be obvious cases of metaphor, while some of them would perhaps be considered less obvious. Nevertheless, it can be claimed that most of the metaphorical linguistic expressions listed above are not literary and most of them are not intended to exhibit some kind of rhetorical ﬂourish. Indeed, most of them are so mundane that a commonly heard charge can be leveled at them— namely, that they are simply “dead” metaphors: metaphors that may have been alive and vigorous at some point but have become so conventional and commonplace with constant use that by now they have lost their vigor and have ceased to be metaphors at all (such as 6 and 13).
The “dead metaphor” account misses an important point: namely, that what is deeply entrenched, hardly noticed, and thus effortlessly used is most active in our thought. The metaphors listed above may be highly conventional and effortlessly used, but this does not mean that they have lost their vigor in thought and that they are dead. On the contrary, they are “alive” in the most important sense—they govern our thought: they are “metaphors we live by.” One example of this involves our comprehension of the mind as a machine. In the preceding list, two sentences reﬂect this way of thinking about the mind:
(10) How could any man ever understand the workings of a woman’s mind?
(14) The coffee was perfect and by the time I was halfway through my ﬁrst cup my brain was ticking over much more briskly.
We think of the mind as a machine. Both lay people and scientists employ this way of understanding the mind. The scientists of today use the most sophisticated machine available as their model—the computer. Lakoff and Johnson call this way of understanding the mind the mind is a machine metaphor. In their view, metaphor is not simply a matter of words or linguistic expressions but of concepts, of thinking of one thing in terms of another. In the examples, two very different linguistic expressions capture aspects of the same concept, the mind, through another concept, machines. In the cognitive linguistic view as developed by Lakoff and Johnson, metaphor is conceptual in nature. In this view, metaphor ceases to be the sole device of creative literary imagination; it becomes a valuable cognitive tool without which neither poets nor you and I as ordinary people could live.
This discussion is not intended to suggest that the ideas mentioned above in what we call the “cognitive linguistic view of metaphor” did not exist before 1980. Obviously, many of them did. Key components of the cognitive

xii PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION: THE STUDY OF METAPHOR
theory were proposed by a diverse range of scholars in the past two thousand years. For example, the idea of the conceptual nature of metaphor was discussed by a number of philosophers, including Locke and Kant, several centuries ago. What is new, then, in the cognitive linguistic view of metaphor? Overall, what is new is that it is a comprehensive, generalized, and empirically tested theory.
First, its comprehensiveness derives from the fact that it discusses a large number of issues connected with metaphor. These include the systematicity of metaphor; the relationship between metaphor and other tropes, or ﬁgures of speech; the universality and culture-speciﬁcness of metaphor; the application of metaphor theory to a range of different kinds of discourse such as literature; the acquisition of metaphor; the teaching of metaphor in foreign language teaching; the nonlinguistic realization of metaphor in a variety of areas such as advertisements; and many others. It is not claimed that these issues have not been dealt with at all in other approaches; instead, the claim is that not all of them have been dealt with within the same theory.
Second, the generalized nature of the theory derives from the fact that it attempts to connect what we know about conceptual metaphor with what we know about the working of language, the working of the human conceptual system, and the working of culture. The cognitive linguistic view of metaphor can provide new insights into how certain linguistic phenomena work, such as polysemy and the development of meaning. It can also shed new light on how metaphorical meaning emerges. It challenges the traditional view that metaphorical language and thought is arbitrary and unmotivated. And it offers the new view that both metaphorical language and thought arise from the basic bodily (sensorimotor) experience of human beings. As it turns out, this notion of “embodiment” very clearly sets off the cognitive linguistic view from the traditional ones.
Third, it is an empirically tested theory in that researchers have used a variety of experiments to test the validity of the major claims of the theory. These experiments have shown that the cognitive view of metaphor is a psychologically viable one: that is, it has psychological reality. Further experiments have shown that, because of its psychological reality, it can be seen as a key instrument not only in producing new words and expressions but also in organizing human thought, and that it may have useful practical applications, for example, in foreign language teaching. I deal with most of these topics in this book, although as can be expected from a book of this sort, I am only able to offer a glimpse of them.
Up until recently, metaphor has been primarily studied by philosophers, rhetoricians, literary critics, psychologists, and linguists such as Aristotle, Hume, Locke, Vico, Herder, Cassirer, Buhler, I. A. Richards, Whorf, Goodman, and Max Black, to mention just a few names from the thousands of people who have done work on metaphor over the past two thousand years. Today, an increasing number of cognitive scientists, including cognitive linguists, engage in research on metaphor. The reason is that metaphor plays a role in human thought, understanding, and reasoning and, beyond that,

PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION: THE STUDY OF METAPHOR xiii
in the creation of our social, cultural, and psychological reality. Trying to understand metaphor, then, means attempting to understand a vital part of who we are and what kind of world we live in.
Lakoff and Johnson initiated this new study of metaphor almost thirty years ago. In fact, it was their work that has partly deﬁned cognitive linguistics itself as we know it today. Many scholars from a variety of disciplines have since contributed to this work over the years and have produced new and important results in the study of metaphor. What has exactly happened in the past three decades in the cognitive linguistic study of metaphor? That is what this book is about.
FURTHER READING
If you want to read up on the background to the study of metaphor, in general, including some of the scholars mentioned here, a good collection of essays is Andrew Ortony, ed., Metaphor and Thought (1993), second edition. What makes this volume especially important reading is that it contains several essays that represent rival views to the cognitive linguistic one. The most comprehensive and authoritative collection of essays on metaphor is Raymond Gibbs, ed., The Cambridge Handbook of Metaphor and Thought (2008). This is also the time to begin to read George Lakoff and Mark Johnson’s Metaphors We Live By, the work that “started it all.” An excellent survey of the view of metaphor developed by Lakoff and Johnson and others is Ray Gibbs, The Poetics of Mind (1994); this work also discusses a great deal of psychological evidence supporting the cognitive linguistic view of metaphor. Olaf Jäkel, “Kant, Blumenberg, Weinrich” (1999) provides a useful survey of the most important predecessors of the cognitive linguistic view. If you are interested in the history of the study of metaphor, you should look at Mark Johnson, ed., Philosophical Perspectives on Metaphor (1981). A representative collection of papers in the cognitive spirit is the volume edited by Raymond Gibbs and Gerard Steen, Metaphor in Cognitive Linguistics (1999). The metaphor dictionary referred to above is Alice Deignan, Collins Cobuild English Guides 7: Metaphor (1995).

Acknowledgments to the Second Edition

My sincere gratitude goes to the Institute of Advanced Study at Durham University, England, where I spent the winter term in 2008 holding a Distinguished Fellowship and where I wrote one of the new chapters, “Metaphor in Discourse,” for this edition. Director Ash Amin and the institute provided me with ideal working conditions that made it possible for me to think about many of the changes and additions in the book. I was fortunate enough to work and have discussions with colleagues at Durham who shared their ideas with me and gave me valuable feedback on my own. They are Kathryn Banks, Boris Wiseman, and, especially, Andreas Musolff and David Cowling.
Back home, I was fortunate enough to receive the prestigious Charles Simonyi Research Scholarship Award in the same year. The award was a boost in every sense of the word, and, as a result, I have accomplished the revision in much less time than it would have otherwise required. My deepest thanks go to the Charles Simonyi Research Scholarship Committee, who deemed my work worthy of the honor.
I also very much appreciate the scholarly help I have received from several colleagues. Ray Gibbs, Réka Benczes, Frank Boers, Charles Forceville, Alan Cienki, Daniel Casasanto, and Lynne Cameron generously shared their ideas with me regarding their recent research on metaphor. Boers, Forceville, and Cienki provided me with extensive summaries of their work. I thank them for their generosity.
Several of my students offered much appreciated help in creating new exercises and overhauling the book in general. I am especially grateful to Eszter Nucz and Orsolya Lazányi (formerly Izsó).
Finally, I thank Peter Ohlin at Oxford University Press for his continued support and encouragement.

What Is Metaphor?
Consider the way native speakers of English often talk about life—either their own lives or those of others:
People might say that they try to give their children an education so they will get a good start in life. If their children act out, they hope that they are just going through a stage and that they will get over it. Parents hope that their children won’t be burdened with ﬁnancial worries or ill health and, if they face such difﬁculties, that they will be able to overcome them. Parents hope that their children will have a long life span and that they will go far in life. But they also know that their children, as all mortals, will reach the end of the road. (based on Winter, 1995, p. 235)
This way of speaking about life would be regarded by most speakers of English as normal and natural for everyday purposes. The use of phrases such as to get a good start, to go through a stage, to get over something, to be burdened, to overcome something, a long life span, to go far in life, to reach the end of the road, and so on would not count as using particularly picturesque or literary language. Below is a list of additional phrases that speakers of English use to talk about the concept of life:
He’s without direction in life. I’m where I want to be in life. I’m at a crossroads in my life. She’ll go places in life. He’s never let anyone get in his way. She’s gone through a lot in life.
Given all these examples, we can see that a large part of the way we speak about life in English derives from the way we speak about journeys. In light of such examples, it seems that speakers of English make extensive use of the
3

4 METAPHOR
domain of journey to think about the highly abstract and elusive concept of life. The question is: Why do they draw so heavily on the domain of journey in their effort to comprehend life? Cognitive linguists suggest that they do so because thinking about the abstract concept of life is facilitated by the more concrete concept of journey.
1. Conceptual versus Linguistic Metaphor
In the cognitive linguistic view, metaphor is deﬁned as understanding one conceptual domain in terms of another conceptual domain. (The issue of precisely what is meant by “understanding” is discussed in section 3.) Examples of this include when we talk and think about life in terms of journeys, about arguments in terms of war, about love also in terms of journeys, about theories in terms of buildings, about ideas in terms of food, about social organizations in terms of plants, and many others. A convenient shorthand way of capturing this view of metaphor is the following: conceptual domain a is conceptual domain b, which is what is called a conceptual metaphor. (The words in boldface in the text are keywords that are deﬁned in the glossary.) A conceptual metaphor consists of two conceptual domains, in which one domain is understood in terms of another. A conceptual domain is any coherent organization of experience. Thus, for example, we have coherently organized knowledge about journeys that we rely on in understanding life. I discuss the nature of this knowledge later in this chapter.
We thus need to distinguish conceptual metaphor from metaphorical linguistic expressions. The latter are words or other linguistic expressions that come from the language or terminology of the more concrete conceptual domain (i.e., domain b). Thus, all the preceding expressions that have to do with life and that come from the domain of journey are linguistic metaphorical expressions, whereas the corresponding conceptual metaphor that they make manifest is life is a journey. The use of small capital letters indicates that the particular wording does not occur in language as such, but it underlies conceptually all the metaphorical expressions listed underneath it.
The two domains that participate in conceptual metaphor have special names. The conceptual domain from which we draw metaphorical expressions to understand another conceptual domain is called source domain, while the conceptual domain that is understood this way is the target domain. Thus, life, arguments, love, theory, ideas, social organizations, and others are target domains, while journeys, war, buildings, food, plants, and others are source domains. The target domain is the domain that we try to understand through the use of the source domain.
But of course in order to be able to suggest the existence of conceptual metaphors, we need to know which linguistic metaphors point to their existence. In other words, we have to be able to distinguish linguistic metaphors from nonmetaphorical (i.e., literal) linguistic items. Given a piece of discourse, we

WHAT IS METAPHOR? 5
need to be able to identify the metaphorical linguistic expressions (including words). A group of researchers, called the Pragglejaz Group, designed the following metaphor identiﬁcation procedure (mip):
1. Read the entire text-discourse to establish a general understanding of the meaning.
2. Determine the lexical units in the text-discourse: 3. (a) For each lexical unit in the text, establish its meaning in context,
that is, how it applies to an entity, relation, or attribute in the situation evoked by the text (contextual meaning). Take into account what comes before and after the lexical unit. (b) For each lexical unit, determine if it has a more basic contemporary meaning in other contexts than the one in the given context. For our purposes, basic meanings tend to be
• More concrete (what they evoke is easier to imagine, see, hear, feel, smell, and taste)
• Related to bodily action • More precise (as opposed to vague) • Historically older.
Basic meanings are not necessarily the most frequent meanings of the lexical unit. (c) If the lexical unit has a more basic current-contemporary meaning
in other contexts than the given context, decide whether the contextual meaning contrasts with the basic meaning but can be understood in comparison with it. 4. If yes, mark the lexical unit as metaphorical. (Pragglejaz Group, 2007, p. 3)
To see how this works, let us take an example. Let us assume that one of our example sentences above He’s without direction in life is part of a larger stretch of discourse and that we interpret the discourse as being about somebody’s life. We also know what the lexical units in the sentence are: he, is, without, direction, in, and life. In examining what the contextual meanings of these lexical units are, we ﬁnd that he refers to a male person mentioned previously in the text; is means “exist”; without denotes “not having something”; direction indicates the person’s general attitude or behavior, that is, the manner the person behaves; in expresses a state; and life is a state in which one is alive. These are the contextual meanings of the lexical units. Now two of these words have a more basic meaning than their contextual meanings: direction and in. The noncontextual meaning of direction, which is the way an entity moves, is more basic than its contextual meaning, the manner in which someone acts or behaves, because it is more concrete. The same applies to in, where the noncontextual meaning is more concrete than the contextual one. Since the two contextual meanings contrast with their noncontextual meanings but can be understood in comparison with them, we can identify the two words as being metaphorically used in our imagined discourse. Not all cases of metaphor identiﬁcation are as straightforward as

6 METAPHOR
the two words we have just discussed, but the procedure serves us well as a good rule of thumb in many cases of identifying linguistic metaphors in a text.
2. Some Examples of Conceptual Metaphor
To see that we do indeed talk about these target domains by making use of such source domains as war, journey, food, let us consider some classic examples of each from Lakoff and Johnson’s Metaphors We Live By. Following the conventions of cognitive linguistics, throughout this volume I use small capitals for the statement of conceptual metaphors and italics for metaphorical linguistic expressions.
an argument is war Your claims are indefensible. He attacked every weak point in my argument. His criticisms were right on target. I demolished his argument. I’ve never won an argument with him. You disagree? Okay, shoot! If you use that strategy, he’ll wipe you out. He shot down all of my arguments.
love is a journey Look how far we’ve come. We’re at a crossroads. We’ll just have to go our separate ways. We can’t turn back now. I don’t think this relationship is going anywhere. Where are we? We’re stuck. It’s been a long, bumpy road. This relationship is a dead-end street. We’re just spinning our wheels. Our marriage is on the rocks. We’ve gotten off the track. This relationship is foundering.
theories are buildings Is that the foundation for your theory? The theory needs more support. We need to construct a strong argument for that. We need to buttress the theory with solid arguments. The theory will stand or fall on the strength of that argument. So far we have put together only the framework of the theory.
ideas are food All this paper has in it are raw facts, half-baked ideas, and warmed-over
theories.

WHAT IS METAPHOR? 7
There are too many facts here for me to digest them all. I just can’t swallow that claim. Let me stew over that for a while. That’s food for thought. She devoured the book. Let’s let that idea simmer on the back burner for a while.
This is just a small sample of all the possible linguistic expressions that speakers of English commonly and conventionally employ to talk about target domains. We can state the nature of the relationship between the conceptual metaphors and the metaphorical linguistic expressions in the following way: the linguistic expressions (i.e., ways of talking) make explicit, or are manifestations of, the conceptual metaphors (i.e., ways of thinking). To put the same thing differently, it is the metaphorical linguistic expressions that reveal the existence of the conceptual metaphors. The terminology of a source domain that is used in the metaphorical process is one kind of evidence for the existence of conceptual metaphor. But it is not the only kind, and I survey other kinds of evidence in later chapters.
An important generalization that emerges from these conceptual metaphors is that conceptual metaphors typically employ a more abstract concept as target and a more concrete or physical concept as their source. Argument, love, idea, and social organization are all more abstract concepts than war, journey, food, and plant. This generalization makes intuitive sense. If we want to fully understand an abstract concept, we are better off using another concept that is more concrete, physical, or tangible than the abstract target concept for this purpose. Our experiences with the physical world serve as a natural and logical foundation for the comprehension of more abstract domains. This explains why in most cases of everyday metaphors the source and target domains are not reversible. For example, we do not talk about ideas as food or journey as love. This is called the principle of unidirectionality; that is, the metaphorical process typically goes from the more concrete to the more abstract but not the other way around.
3. Conceptual Metaphor as a Set of Mappings
So far we have used the word “to understand” to characterize the relationship between two concepts (a and b) in the metaphorical process. But what does it mean exactly that a is understood in terms of b? The answer is that there is a set of systematic correspondences between the source and the target in the sense that constituent conceptual elements of b correspond to constituent elements of a. Technically, these conceptual correspondences are often referred to as mappings.
This use of the word “understand” in the characterization of conceptual metaphor is not acceptable to all metaphor scholars. Especially those who are interested in the real-time, or online, process of metaphorical under-

8 METAPHOR
standing object to the use of the word here, arguing that when we talk metaphorically about, say, life as a journey, the highly conventional journey-related expressions do not necessarily evoke images of a journey in the real-time, online process of understanding. (I come back to this issue in chapter 3, section 2.4.) Whether they do or do not is an empirical issue. At this point, however, it seems safest to understand the word “understand” as being synonymous in the deﬁnition of metaphor to the words construe or conceive, which commit us less to the real-time, online aspect of understanding and can be more easily used in the long-term sense of what metaphorical understanding involves. That is, we have a conceptual metaphor when we construe a more abstract domain (or concept) through a more physical domain (or concept) ofﬂine–either by means of long-term memory or as a result of a historical-cultural process (i.e., not necessarily online or in real time). In chapter 19 I refer to this level of metaphor as the “supraindividual level.” The use of the word construe in this reworded deﬁnition comes with an added advantage: it makes the deﬁnition of conceptual metaphor coherent with that of grammatical constructions used in cognitive linguistics, in that grammatical constructions also function as ways of construing aspects of experience in this more general sense (see chapter 16).
Let us now look at some cases where elements of the source domain are mapped onto elements of the target domain. Let’s take the love is a journey conceptual metaphor ﬁrst. When we use the sentence We aren’t going anywhere, the expression go somewhere indicates traveling to a destination, in this particular sentence, a journey that has no clear destination. The word we obviously refers to the travelers involved. This sentence then gives us three constituent elements of journeys: the travelers, the travel or the journey as such, and the destination. However, when we hear this sentence in the appropriate context, we will interpret it to be about love, and we will know that the speaker of the sentence has in mind not real travelers but lovers, not a physical journey but the events in a love relationship, and not a physical destination at the end of the journey but the goal(s) of the love relationship. The sentence The relationship is foundering suggests that somehow relationships are conceptually equated with the vehicles used in journeys. The sentence It’s been a bumpy road is not about the physical obstacles on the way but about the difﬁculties that the lovers experience in their relationship. Furthermore, talking about love, the speaker of We’ve made a lot of headway will mean that a great deal of progress has been made in the relationship, and not that the travelers traveled far. And the sentence We’re at a crossroads will mean that choices have to be made in the relationship, and not that a traveler has to decide which way to go at a fork in the road.
Given these interpretations, we can lay out a set of correspondences, or mappings between constituent elements of the source and those of the target. (In giving the correspondences, or mappings, we reverse the target-source order of the conceptual metaphors to yield source-target. We adopt this con-

WHAT IS METAPHOR? 9
vention to emphasize the point that understanding typically goes from the more concrete to the more abstract concept.)

Source: JOURNEY

Target: LOVE

the travelers

⇒ the lovers

the vehicle

⇒ the love relationship itself

the journey

⇒ events in the relationship

the distance covered

⇒ the progress made

the obstacles encountered

⇒ the difﬁculties experienced

decisions about which way to go ⇒ choices about what to do

the destination of the journey ⇒ the goal(s) of the relationship

This is the systematic set of correspondences, or mappings, that characterize the love is a journey conceptual metaphor. Constituent elements of conceptual domain a are in systematic correspondence with constituent elements of conceptual domain b. From this discussion, it might seem that the elements in the target domain have been there all along and that people came up with this metaphor because there were preexisting similarities between the elements in the two domains. This is not so. The domain of love did not have these elements before it was structured by the domain of journey. It was the application of the journey domain to the love domain that provided the concept of love with this particular structure or set of elements. In a way, it was the concept of journey that “created” the concept of love.
To see that this is so, try to do a thought experiment. Try to imagine the goal, choice, difﬁculty, or progress aspect of love without making use of the journey domain. Can you think of the goal of a love relationship without at the same time thinking of trying to reach a destination at the end of a journey? Can you think of the progress made in a love relationship without at the same time imagining the distance covered in a journey? Can you think of the choices made in a love relationship without thinking of choosing a direction in a journey? The difﬁculty of doing this shows that the target of love is not structured independently of and prior to the domain of journey.
Another piece of evidence for the view that the target of love is not structured independently of any source domains is the following. In talking about the elements that structure a target domain, it is often difﬁcult to name the elements without recourse to the language of the source. In the present example, we talk about the goals associated with love, but this is just a slightly “disguised” way of talking about destinations given in the source; the word goal has an additional literal or physical use—not just a metaphorical one. In the same way, the word progress also has a literal or physical meaning, and it comes from a word meaning “step, go.” These examples show that many elements of target concepts come from source domains and are not preexisting.
We can now consider another example of how correspondences, or mappings, make up a conceptual metaphor.

10 METAPHOR

social organizations are plants He works for the local branch of the bank. Our company is growing. They had to prune the workforce. The organization was rooted in the old church. There is now a ﬂourishing black market in software there. His business blossomed when the railways put his establishment within
reach of the big city. Employers reaped enormous beneﬁts from cheap foreign labour.

This seems to be characterized by the following set of mappings:

Source: plant

Target: social organization

(a) the whole plant

⇒ the entire organization

(b) a part of the plant

⇒ a part of the organization

(c) growth of the plant

⇒ development of the organization

(d) removing a part of the plant ⇒ reducing the organization

(e) the root of the plant

⇒ the origin of the organization

(f) the ﬂowering

⇒ the best stage, the most successful

stage

(g) the fruits or crops

⇒ the beneﬁcial consequences

Notice that in this case as well, constituent elements of plants correspond systematically to constituent elements of social organizations, such as companies, and the words that are used about plants are employed systematically in connection with organizations. This correspondence can be seen in all of the mappings, except mapping (a), which is merely assumed by the sentence: “He works for the local branch of the bank.” The mappings (indicated by the letters used above) and the matching expressions that make them manifest in the plants metaphor are listed below:

(b) branch (c) is growing (d) prune (e) root (f) blossom, ﬂower (g) fruits

In light of the discussion so far, we can ask: What does it mean then to know a metaphor? It means to know the systematic mappings between a source and a target. It is not suggested that this happens in a conscious manner. This knowledge is largely unconscious, and it is only for the purposes of analysis that we bring the mappings into awareness. However, when we know a conceptual metaphor, we use the linguistic expressions that reﬂect it in such a way that we do not violate the mappings that are conventionally ﬁxed for the linguistic community. In other words, not any element of b can be mapped onto any element of a. The linguistic expressions used metaphorically must conform to established mappings, or correspondences, between the source and the target.

4. The Importance of Metaphor
But how important is metaphor in our lives and how important is it to study? One of the best (but not quite serious) illustrations of the seriousness and importance of metaphor can be found in the myth of Oedipus. As part of the myth, Oedipus arrives in Thebes where he ﬁnds that a monster, called the Sphinx, is guarding the road to the city. She poses riddles to everyone on their way to Thebes and devours them if they are unable to solve the riddles. So far, everyone has been devoured when Oedipus arrives. The Sphinx asks him the riddle: Which is the animal that has four feet in the morning, two at midday, and three in the evening? Without hesitation, Oedipus answers: Man, who in infancy crawls on all fours, who walks upright in maturity, and in his old age supports himself with a stick. The Sphinx is defeated and kills herself. Oedipus thus becomes the king of Thebes. How was Oedipus able to solve the riddle? At least a part of this must have been his knowledge of conceptual metaphor. There appear to be two metaphors operative in ﬁguring out the riddle. The ﬁrst is the metaphor the life of human beings is a day. Oedipus must have been helped by the correspondences that obtain between the target concept of life and the source domain of day. Morning corresponds to infancy, midday to mature adulthood, and evening to old age. Since he knew these mappings, he offered the correct solution. Another, and maybe less important, metaphor that may have played a part is human life is a journey. This metaphor is evoked by the frequent mention and thus the important role of feet in the riddle. Feet evoke the concept of journey that may provide a clue to the successful solution of the riddle through the human life is a journey metaphor. This reading is reinforced by the fact that much of the myth is a tale of Oedipus’s life in the form of a journey.
All in all, Oedipus’s life, at least on this occasion, is saved in part by his knowledge of metaphor. Can there be a more important reason and better motivation to ﬁnd out about metaphor?
5. Some Questions About Metaphor
Given this characterization of metaphor in cognitive linguistics, several important questions arise. The answers to these questions will make up much of the rest of this book. They include the following:
(1) Common source and target domains. If we want to get a good idea of the range of conceptual metaphors in English, we have to ask three speciﬁc questions: (a) What are the most common abstract targets in English? That is, given the many abstract domains, do all of them require an equal amount of metaphorical understanding? (b) What are the most common source concepts? That is, given the large number of potential source domains from the

12 METAPHOR
physical world, do all of them participate in metaphorical understanding to the same degree? And (c) Which sources are used to understand which targets? That is, given the most common targets and sources, is it the case that any source can be used to comprehend any target? These issues are discussed in chapter 2. (2) Kinds of metaphor. Are all conceptual metaphors like the ones we have dealt with so far? It will be shown that there are distinct kinds within the larger category of conceptual metaphor and that it is possible to classify metaphors in a variety of ways. The characterization of the distinct classes will enable us to see the subtle differences in the nature, function, and power of metaphor. This is the topic of chapter 3. (3) Metaphor in literature. The language of literature is often metaphorical. What can the view of metaphor as presented here contribute to the study of literature? Indeed, what is the relationship between everyday metaphor and metaphor used in literature? This issue is discussed in chapter 4. (4) Nonlinguistic realizations of conceptual metaphors. It was mentioned above that we use primarily linguistic evidence for the existence of conceptual metaphors. But there are other kinds of available evidence as well. Conceptual metaphors manifest themselves, or are realized, in ways other than linguistic. What then are the most common ways in which conceptual metaphors are realized in a culture? I try to provide an answer in chapter 5. (5) The basis of metaphor. It was pointed out that there is a potentially vast range of target domains and an equally huge range of source domains. If any source domain could be paired with any target domain, we would have completely arbitrary conceptual metaphors. However, this does not seem to be the case. Only some connections or pairings between sources and targets are acceptable. This indicates that there are certain limitations on what can become conceptual metaphors. What are the limitations that possibly motivate metaphorical links between a and b? I take up this issue in chapter 6. (6) Partial mappings. It was claimed that conceptual metaphors can be characterized by the formula a is b. This would assume that an entire target domain would be understood in terms of an entire source domain. This obviously cannot be the case because it would mean that one conceptual domain would be exactly the same as another. I will show that mappings can be, and are, only partial. Only a part of b is mapped onto a part of a. We need to ask which parts of the source are mapped onto which parts in the target. The issue is addressed in chapter 7. (7) Cognitive models, metaphors, and embodiment. What is the relationship between metaphors and concepts as represented by cognitive models? I will show through the analysis of the emotion domain that metaphors can create several distinct prototypical concepts for the same emotion. Emotion metaphors may be embodied and their embodiment may take different shapes. These issues will be explored in chapter 8.

WHAT IS METAPHOR? 13
(8) Metaphorical entailments. We have seen that conceptual metaphor consists of a set of mappings between a source and a target. Given the rich knowledge we have about concrete source domains, how much and what knowledge is carried over from source b to target a? In other words, to what extent do we make use of this rich knowledge about sources beyond the basic constituent elements as discussed in the mappings above? Why isn’t everything carried over from b to a? What determines what is not carried over? An explanation is offered in chapter 9.
(9) The scope of metaphor. Most of the speciﬁc source domains appear to characterize not just one target concept but several. For instance, the concept of war applies not only to arguments but also to love, the concept of building not only to theories but also to societies, the concept of ﬁre not only to love but also to anger, and so on. What is the scope of metaphorical source domains and what determines it? I deal with the issue in chapter 10.
(10) Metaphor systems. Some conceptual metaphors appear to cluster together to form larger subsystems of metaphor. Do we have any idea what some of these larger subsystems are? What might the overarching metaphorical system of English look like? I describe systems of metaphor in chapter 11.
(11) Another ﬁgure: metonymy. Metaphor is closely related to several other “tropes”; most important, to metonymy. What are the similarities between them, and how do they differ from each other? I try to characterize the relationship between metaphor and metonymy in chapter 12.
(12) The universality of conceptual metaphors. Some conceptual metaphors appear to be at least near-universal. What can possibly determine the universality of these metaphors? The issue is raised and answered in chapter 13.
(13) Cultural variation in metaphor. Other metaphors tend to be culture-speciﬁc. Indeed, what kind of variation is there in metaphor? In addition to varying cross-culturally, do they also vary subculturally, individually, and geographically? I offer some tentative answers to these questions in chapter 14.
(14) Idioms and metaphor. One aspect of language where metaphor ﬁgures prominently is idioms. Idioms are often metaphorical. How can we characterize the relationship between idioms and metaphor on the basis of the cognitive linguistic view? I address the issue in chapter 15.
(15) Metaphor in the study of language. Metaphor is important not only in idioms but also in many other areas of the study of language. What can linguistics gain from the cognitive approach to metaphor? I discuss some examples of the usefulness of the cognitive view of metaphor in the study of language in chapter 16.
(16) Blending and metaphor. The cognitive view of metaphor is not a closed system of ideas. There are some recent developments that add to, enhance, and complement this system. One of the most signiﬁcant of these is the theory of “network models.” This new development is the topic of chapter 17.

14 METAPHOR
(17) Metaphor in discourse. Metaphors gain their full value when they occur in real discourse. What is the function of metaphors in discourse? Do we simply use preestablished conventional metaphors when we produce texts? Do the metaphors used in conversations differ from those used in written discourse? I answer these questions in chapter 18.
To understand the metaphorical process in some of its complexity, we must focus on these issues.
SUMMARY
We have made a distinction between conceptual metaphors and metaphorical linguistic expressions. In conceptual metaphors, one domain of experience is used to understand another domain of experience. The metaphorical linguistic expressions make manifest particular conceptual metaphors. The conceptual domain that we try to understand is called the target domain, and the conceptual domain that we use for this purpose is the source domain.
There is now a systematic procedure for the identiﬁcation of metaphorically used words and expressions in real discourse. This tool is known as metaphor identiﬁcation procedure (MIP).
Understanding one domain in terms of another involves a set of ﬁxed correspondences (technically called mappings) between a source and a target domain. This set of mappings obtains between basic constituent elements of the source domain and basic constituent elements of the target. To know a conceptual metaphor is to know the set of mappings that applies to a given source-target pairing. It is these mappings that provide much of the meaning of the metaphorical linguistic expressions (or linguistic metaphors) that make a particular conceptual metaphor manifest.
There are several issues that arise in connection with this view of metaphor. The answers to these issues are discussed in subsequent chapters of the book.
FURTHER READING
Lakoff and Johnson (1980) introduce the notion of conceptual metaphor. Their book contains many of the conceptual metaphors discussed in the chapter, as well as more linguistic examples for these metaphors. Lakoff (1993) is a survey of a more sophisticated later version of the cognitive linguistic view. The idea that conceptual metaphor is constituted by a set of mappings between a source and a target domain is discussed primarily on the basis of the same paper by Lakoff. The life is a journey metaphor is discussed by Lakoff (1994) and Winter (1995). Helpful comments on correspondences, or mappings, can be found in Lakoff and Kövecses (1987).
Steen (1999) offers an “identiﬁcation procedure” for metaphorical expressions. Several authors deal with the issue of metaphor identiﬁcation and the research of metaphor in general in a volume edited by Cameron and Low (1999b). A fully explicit recent version of the metaphorical identiﬁcation procedure (MIP) can be found in Pragglejaz Group (2007). A highly systematic

theoretical exploration of the many issues surrounding metaphor identiﬁcation is Steen (2008).
Criticisms of the early forms of the cognitive view of metaphor can be found in Holland (1982), Ortony (1988), and Wierzbicka (1986). Rakova (2002) and Haser (2005) challenge cognitive linguistics in general and conceptual metaphor theory in particular on philosophical grounds.

Common
Source and
Target Domains
It was shown in chapter 1 that conceptual metaphors consist of a source domain and a target domain, as well as a set of mappings between them. It was also noted that the source domains are typically more concrete or physical and more clearly delineated concepts than the targets, which tend to be fairly abstract and less-delineated ones. What, then, are the most commonly used source and target domains? In other words, which clearly delineated physical concepts are used most commonly in understanding which less clearly delineated abstract concepts?
I use two kinds of evidence in examining this issue. One kind is provided by various metaphor dictionaries and lists of conceptual metaphors, such as the Master Metaphor List. I have also looked at several metaphor dictionaries to ﬁnd out which sources and targets occur most frequently. These dictionaries include the Collins Cobuild metaphor dictionary, the metaphor section of Rodale’s Phrase Finder, the Metaphors Dictionary, the Dictionary of Everyday English Metaphors, and Roget’s Thesaurus, to mention the best-known ones. I tried to determine which sources are employed most commonly to understand which common targets. I did not do a systematic study, but I believe that what I found is consistent across the metaphor dictionaries that were consulted. The other source of evidence comes from the research of scholars working within the cognitive linguistic tradition. I have surveyed most of the available literature on conceptual metaphor in order to see which sources and which targets stand out quantitatively in this body of research. Again, the ﬁndings based on this research are consistent with the ﬁndings based on the survey of metaphor dictionaries: roughly the same conceptual domains stand out as the most common sources and targets in both.
Another issue that I pay some attention to in this chapter is that of the directionality of conceptual metaphors; that is, the question of the reversibility of source and target domains. This issue was already mentioned in
17

18 METAPHOR
chapter 1. In this chapter, however, I consider a much greater number of examples that will allow us to be more conﬁdent in one of the basic claims of the cognitive linguistic view of metaphor; namely, that in most cases source and target domains are not reversible.
1. Common Source Domains
In studying the most common source domains, I found that the most systematic comprehensive survey is provided by Alice Deignan’s Collins Cobuild English Guides 7: Metaphor (cited as the Collins Cobuild metaphor dictionary in this volume). I have supplemented the list of sources offered by this metaphor dictionary with some additional ones from my survey of metaphor research. Here I brieﬂy mention the most frequent sources.
1.1. The Human Body
The human body is an ideal source domain, since, for us, it is clearly delineated and (we believe) we know it well. This does not mean that we make use of all aspects of this domain in metaphorically understanding abstract targets. The aspects that are especially used in metaphorical comprehension involve various parts of the body, including the head, face, legs, hands, back, heart, bones, shoulders, and others. Some examples follow:
the heart of the problem to shoulder a responsibility the head of the department
One of my students, Réka Hajdú (who has since become Réka Benczes and a colleague of mine), did a comprehensive study of a recent American collection of metaphorical idioms titled “Figurative Idioms” by George Nagy. She counted all the body-based metaphorical idioms in the dictionary and found that out of twelve thousand idioms, well over two thousand have to do with the human body. This remarkable ﬁnding shows that a large portion of metaphorical meaning derives from our experience of our own body. The “embodiment” of meaning is perhaps the central idea of the cognitive linguistic view of metaphor and, indeed, of the cognitive linguistic view of meaning. As can be expected, the human body plays a key role in the emergence of metaphorical meaning in English and other “Western” languages and cultures; in addition, scholars such as Bernd Heine and others have abundantly demonstrated its central importance in human conceptualization in languages and cultures around the world. I return to the discussion of embodiment in several later chapters (especially chapters 6 and 8).

COMMON SOURCE AND TARGET DOMAINS 19
1.2. Health and Illness Both the general properties of health and illness and particular illnesses frequently constitute metaphorical source domains. Some examples include:
a healthy society a sick mind She hurt my feelings.
1.3. Animals The domain of animals is an extremely productive source domain. Human beings are especially frequently understood in terms of (assumed) properties of animals. Thus, we talk about someone being a brute, a tiger, a dog, a sly fox, a bitch, a cow, a snake, and so on. But the metaphorical use of animal terms is not limited to human beings, as indicated by the example “It will be a bitch to pull this boat out of the water.” In this instance, the term bitch denotes any difﬁcult situation. The body parts of animals are also commonly used in the metaphorical conceptualization of abstract domains. This way of understanding nonphysical domains is also very common in languages of the world, as Heine and his colleagues show.
1.4. Plants People cultivate plants for a variety of purposes: for eating, for pleasure, for making things, and so on. When we use the concept metaphorically, we distinguish various parts of plants; we are aware of the many actions we perform in relation to plants; and we recognize the many different stages of growth that plants go through. Here are some examples:
a budding beauty He cultivated his friendship with her. the fruit of her labor Exports ﬂourished last year.
1.5. Buildings and Construction Human beings build houses and other structures for shelter, work, storage, and so on. Both the static object of a house and its parts and the act of building it serve as common metaphorical source domains. Some examples follow:
a towering genius He’s in ruins ﬁnancially. She constructed a coherent argument.

20 METAPHOR
1.6. Machines and Tools People use machines and tools to work, play, ﬁght, and for pleasure. Again, both the machines and tools and the activities related to them show up as metaphorical expressions, as illustrated by the following examples:
the machine of democracy conceptual tools She produces a book every year.
1.7. Games and Sport People play and they invent elaborate activities to entertain themselves. Games and sport are characterized by certain properties that are commonly used for metaphorical purposes. For example, many games have rules, and this property occurs in examples such as “He plays by the rules” and “We want an even playing ﬁeld.” Additional examples from the domain of games and sport include:
to toy with the idea He tried to checkmate her. He’s a heavyweight politician.
1.8. Money and Economic Transactions (Business) From early on, people living in human society have engaged in economic transactions of various kinds. These transactions often involve the use of money and commodities in general. The commercial event involves a number of entities and actions: a commodity, money, handing over the commodity, and handing over the money. Our understanding of various abstract things is based on this scenario or parts of it. Below are some examples:
Spend your time wisely. I tried to save some energy. She invested a lot in the relationship.
1.9. Cooking and Food Cooking food as an activity has been with us ever since the beginnings of humanity. Cooking involves a complex process of several elements: an agent, recipe, ingredients, actions, and a product, just to mention the most important ones. The activity with its parts and the product serve as a deeply entrenched source domain. Here are some examples:

COMMON SOURCE AND TARGET DOMAINS 21
What’s your recipe for success? That’s a watered-down idea. He cooked up a story that nobody believed.
1.10. Heat and Cold
Heat and cold are extremely basic human experiences. We feel warm and cold as a result of the temperature of the air that surrounds us. We often use the temperature domain metaphorically to talk about our attitude to people and things. Here are a few examples to illustrate:
in the heat of passion a cold reception an icy stare a warm welcome
As the example with the word icy shows, the properties of warmth and cold sometimes appear as weather conditions.
The domain of ﬁre is related to that of heat. In addition to using ﬁre to keep ourselves warm, we also use ﬁre to cook and to destroy things. This source domain is especially common in the metaphorical conceptualization of passions and desires, such as rage, love, hate, and some others. For example, a person can be described as “burning with love” or “smoldering with anger.” But the source domain of ﬁre enables us to observe an interesting aspect of many conceptual metaphors. Often, in the case of conceptual metaphors, a typical source domain can also be further conceptualized by another source; that is, source domains can become target domains. Thus, the domain of ﬁre itself, a typical source for many conceptual metaphors, can also be understood metaphorically in terms of other domains. As an example, consider the fire is a hungry animal metaphor, which produces linguistic metaphors such as “The ﬁre devoured everything” and “The ﬁre was already licking at the ﬁrst row of houses.” The same process producing “metaphor chains” can be noticed in the body metaphor discussed above; that is, the human body can also function as a target domain, as when we say “I feel a little rusty today.” This “chain-producing” aspect of metaphor has not been explored in the cognitive linguistic approach, and its mechanism is unaccounted for.
1.11. Light and Darkness
Light and darkness are also basic human experiences. The properties of light and darkness often appear as weather conditions when we speak and think metaphorically. Let us see some examples:
a dark mood She brightened up.

22 METAPHOR
a cloud of suspicion There was a cloud over their friendship. I do not have the foggiest idea. She was in a haze of confusion.
1.12. Forces
There are various kinds of forces: gravitational, magnetic, electric, and mechanical. We see these forces as operating on and affecting us in many ways. The forces take many shapes in the physical world: waves, wind, storm, ﬁre, and agents pushing, pulling, driving, or sending another thing. These forces effect various changes in the thing acted on. There are as many different effects as there are different forces. The metaphorical conceptualization of several abstract domains in terms of forces is reﬂected in the following examples:
She swept me off my feet. You’re driving me nuts. Don’t push me! I was overwhelmed.
1.13. Movement and Direction
Movement—either self-propelled or otherwise—is yet another basic experience. Movement can involve a change of location, or it can be stationary (as in the case of shaking, for instance). When it involves a change of location, it is associated with direction: forward and backward, up and down. Changes of various kinds are conceptualized metaphorically as movement that involves a change of location. This is indicated by the examples:
He went crazy. She solved the problem step by step. Inﬂation is soaring. Our economy is galloping ahead.
Obviously, this is not a complete survey of domains that participate in conceptual metaphors as sources. Further sources include various basic entities, such as containers, substances, physical objects, and several others. I come back to these in chapter 3. Common source domains also include the various properties of objects and substances, such as their shape, color, size, hardness, transparency, sharpness, weight, and many more. However, despite the representative nature of the list, we get a sense of the most common source domains and the kind of world that our most common metaphors depict. In this world, it seems, there are people, animals, and plants; the people live in houses, they have bodies, they eat, they get sick and get better; they move around and travel; they live in a physical environment with all kinds of objects and substances in it; the objects and substances have all kinds of properties; the physical environment

COMMON SOURCE AND TARGET DOMAINS 23
affects the people; and the people make tools, work, and engage in various other transactions with other people. This is an extremely simpliﬁed world, but it is exactly the simpliﬁed nature of this world that enables us to make use of parts of it in creating more complex abstract ones.
2. Common Target Domains
In the same way as the source domains apply to several targets, the targets also have several sources. Target domains are abstract, diffuse, and lack clear delineation; as a result, they “cry out” for metaphorical conceptualization. I can only survey here the most common target domains and their most important sources.
2.1. Emotion The domain of emotion is a superior target domain. Emotion concepts such as anger, fear, love, happiness, sadness, shame, pride, and so on are primarily understood by means of conceptual metaphors. The source domains of emotion concepts typically involve forces. Thus, we have examples like
She was deeply moved. He was bursting with joy. He unleashed his anger.
Because emotions are largely comprehended via force metaphors, it is not surprising that, etymologically, the word emotion derives from the Latin e meaning “out” and movere meaning “to move.”
2.2. Desire In regard to metaphorical conceptualization, desire is similar to emotion. It is also comprehended as a force, not just a physical one but a physiological force like hunger or thirst. It is also often understood in terms of heat. Some examples include:
The jacket I saw in the shopwindow pulled me into the store. She is hungry for knowledge. I am starved for affection. He’s burning to go.
2.3. Morality Moral categories such as good and bad, as well as honesty, courage, sincerity, honor, and their opposites, are largely understood by means of more concrete source concepts. Among these, economic transactions, forces, straightness,

24 METAPHOR
light and dark, and up-down orientation are especially important, as the examples below indicate:
I’ll pay you back for this. She resisted the temptation. He’s a straight shooter. He’s a shady character. That was a lowly thing to do.
2.4. Thought How the human mind works is still little known. This situation makes it no surprise that people, both lay persons and experts, try to understand the mind by resorting to metaphors of various kinds. Rational thought is comprehended as work—the manipulation of objects in a workshop. Less-active aspects of thought are understood in terms of perception, such as seeing. Some examples to demonstrate this follow:
She’s grinding out new ideas. He hammered the point home. He searched for the memory. I see your point.
2.5. Society / Nation The concepts of society and nation are extremely complex, and this complexity calls for metaphorical understanding. Common ways of comprehending society and nation involve the source concepts of person and family:
What do we owe society? neighboring countries a friendly nation the founding fathers of the country
Other aspects of society are viewed as machines or the human body:
the machinery of democracy the functioning of society the ills of society
2.6. Politics Politics has to do with the exercise of power. Political power is conceptualized as physical force. Politics has many additional aspects that are understood

COMMON SOURCE AND TARGET DOMAINS 25
by means of a variety of further source domains, including games and sport, business, and war.
They forced the opposition out of the House. The president plays hardball. There was a great deal of haggling over the issue. The ﬁght erupted over abortion.
2.7. Economy Economy is usually comprehended via metaphor. Its most commonly used source domains include building, plants, and journey (movement, direction), as shown by the examples:
Germany built a strong economy. the growth of the economy They pruned the budget. China’s economy is galloping ahead.
2.8. Human Relationships Human relationships include such concepts as friendship, love, and marriage. These and similar concepts are metaphorically viewed as plants, machines, and buildings, as shown by the examples:
Their friendship is in full ﬂower. It’s a budding relationship. They had to work on their relationship. They built a strong marriage.
2.9. Communication We conceive of human communication as involving a speaker and a hearer, a message consisting of some meaning encoded in linguistic expressions, and a transfer of this message from the speaker to the hearer along some channel. Metaphorically, we view the linguistic expressions, meanings, and the transfer of the message as containers, objects, and sending, respectively. Here are some examples to illustrate this:
You are putting too many ideas into a single sentence. That’s a dense paragraph. She gave me a lot of information.
It should be pointed out here that this metaphor is not the only one for communication, but it represents the most common “folk theory” of what

26 METAPHOR
human communication involves. This metaphor is dealt with in greater detail in chapter 6.
2.10. Time Time is a notoriously difﬁcult concept to understand. The major metaphor for the comprehension of time is one according to which time is an object that moves. Many common everyday expressions demonstrate this:
The time will come when . . . Christmas is coming up soon. Time ﬂies. in the following week Time goes by fast.
2.11. Life and Death The metaphorical conceptualization of life and death is pervasive in both everyday language and literary works. As noted in chapter 1, life is understood as a journey to some destination. Moreover, it is metaphorically day, light, warmth, and others. Birth is conceived of as arrival, whereas death is viewed as departure, as well as night, darkness, and cold:
The baby will arrive soon. Grandpa is gone. His father passed away.
2.12. Religion Key aspects of religion involve our view of God and our relationship to God. (Notice that to use a personal pronoun to replace the word God would already require metaphorical understanding: Should we refer to God as it or him or she?) God, similar to the concepts of society and nation, is conceptualized as a person: Father, Shepherd, King, and the like. It follows from the metaphor that believers are viewed as God’s children, sheep, or subjects. Other aspects of religious experience involve the conceptualization of such notions as eternity, life after and before death, and so on, which are necessarily metaphorical, since we have no experience of them.
2.13. Events and Actions Events and actions are superordinate concepts that comprise a variety of different kinds of events and actions. For example, reading, making a chair, doing a project in the lab, plowing, or whatever are kinds of actions. Aspects

COMMON SOURCE AND TARGET DOMAINS 27
of events and actions are often comprehended as movement and force. These aspects include such notions as change, cause, purpose, means, and so on. Here are some examples that show this:
He went crazy. She turned thirty last month. You’re driving me nuts. The goal sent the crowd into a frenzy. She has reached her goals in life.
As can be seen, these common target domains can be roughly classiﬁed as psychological and mental states and events (emotion, desire, morality, thought), social groups and processes (society, politics, economy, human relationships, communication), and personal experiences and events (time, life, death, religion). The superordinate concepts of events and actions are difﬁcult to place in this scheme. Another difﬁculty is to see exactly how the simpliﬁed world, as depicted in the most common source domains, ﬁts and “maps onto” the groups of common target domains described above. However, in chapter 11 on metaphor systems I attempt to work out this “ﬁt,” at least in its most general outline.
Despite the several different sources of information, the suggestions here concerning the most common source and target domains can only be tentative. More precise and more reliable ways of ﬁnding the most common source and target domains are needed. Such work has begun in metaphor studies in the past decade. Corpus linguistics has emerged as a remarkable new tool in the study of metaphor that, as far as I can tell, mostly conﬁrms but also often challenges and requires us to modify the ﬁndings of conceptual metaphor theory. Unfortunately, the particular issue of which domains constitute the most common sources and targets has not, to the best of my knowledge, been investigated by corpus linguistic means, although remarkable advances have been made in the study of numerous related issues.
As a matter of fact, consider what it would involve to ﬁnd out what the most common source and target domains are by corpus linguistic means. First, we would have to ﬁnd all the source and target domains before we could see what the most common ones are. However, to discover all of them, you would have to identify all the linguistic metaphors in the corpus. And to identify all of them manually in any large corpus would probably take an extremely long time. (There seem to be no mechanical, computer-assisted ways of doing this.) There are also other difﬁculties. Language changes constantly, so the linguistic and conceptual metaphors could only be identiﬁed at a particular time. By the time all the linguistic and conceptual metaphors would be identiﬁed, language would change again. And this is just for one language. Clearly, the task is a tall order!
The survey in this chapter also enables us to reinforce the conclusion that conceptual metaphors are mostly unidirectional. While we commonly talk about the illness of society, the machinery of political decision-making, and

28 METAPHOR
the heat of passion, we do not or much less commonly talk about the society of illness, the political decision-making of machinery, or the passion of heat. In some cases, however, the source and target can be reversed. Take the anger is a storm metaphor, with examples such as “It was a stormy meeting” or “He stormed out of the room.” But we can also have a storm is anger (an angry person), as exempliﬁed by expressions such as “angry waves” or “The storm was raging for hours.” However, when source and target domains of conceptual metaphors are reversed, there typically occur certain stylistic shifts in the value of the linguistic metaphors. In this example, the reversal of the usual source-target pairing results in expressions that are not everyday but literary or formal.
There is, though, a kind of metaphor that seems to be reversible. Linguistic metaphors such as “This surgeon is a butcher” and “My home is a jail”— that is, ones that have the form noun-is-noun—seem to be readily reversible. Take, for instance, the metaphorical statement “This surgeon is a butcher.” Its reversed version is also acceptable: “This butcher is a surgeon.” However, in this case there is a shift of meaning. While the statement of the surgeon being a butcher is considered to be negative, the reverse statement of the butcher being a surgeon is considered as something positive. Reversibility is found commonly in linguistic metaphors of the form a is b as studied by Sam Glucksberg (where a and b are nouns) that are based on subcategorization, as in the present example: the surgeon is classiﬁed as a butcher and the butcher as a surgeon. Such subcategorization-based metaphors seem to work both ways if the participating concepts are roughly at the same level of abstraction and if they represent a particular “meaning focus” in their source domain status. (The notion of “meaning focus” is discussed in chapter 10.) Surgeon and butcher, home and jail, and many other cases can be reversed because they are more or less on the same level and because they carry particular meaning speciﬁcations as source domains, such as “works with imprecise tools” (in contrast to surgeons) in the case of butcher and “(physical, mental, emotional, etc.) conﬁnement” in the case of jail. I reanalyze this metaphor in chapter 19.
SUMMARY
In this chapter, I have surveyed some of the most common source and target domains. These source domains include the human body, health and illness, animals, machines and tools, buildings and construction, plants, games and sport, cooking and food, economic transactions, forces, light and darkness, heat and cold, and movement and direction.
The common targets include emotion, desire, morality, thought, society, religion, politics, economy, human relationships, communication, events and actions, time, and life and death. The target domains fall into such higher groups as psychological and mental states and events, social groups and processes, and personal experiences.

COMMON SOURCE AND TARGET DOMAINS 29
These ﬁndings provide overwhelming evidence for the view that conceptual metaphors are unidirectional: they go from concrete to abstract domains—the most common source domains are concrete, while the most common targets are abstract concepts. In this way, conceptual metaphors can serve the purpose of understanding intangible, and hence difﬁcult-to-understand, concepts.
FURTHER READING
Metaphors We Live By by Lakoff and Johnson (1980) is the classic study of the contemporary view of metaphor in cognitive linguistics. It deals with several source and target domains. Gibbs (1994) discusses several of the source and target domains I have mentioned in this chapter and provides evidence for the ubiquity, or omnipresence, of metaphor in everyday thought. These are basic works that should be read by anyone interested in the cognitive linguistic view of metaphor.
Jäkel (1995) describes a large system of metaphors relating to the mind and thought, in which the mind is viewed as a workshop and thought as the manipulation of tools and objects. Jäkel (1993) tests the notion of the unidirectionality of metaphor and ﬁnds that in the majority of cases conceptual metaphors are not reversible. In contrast, Johnson (1987) emphasizes a different metaphorical source domain in discussing the mind and human thought processes: understanding-as-seeing. Johnson (1992) is a discussion of morality as moral accounting. Kövecses (1986, 1988, 1990, 1991a, 1991b) are analyses of various emotion concepts. Kövecses (1994) discusses Alexis de Tocqueville’s metaphors for society in general and American democracy in particular. Benczes (2008) investigates the metaphor systems of North American slavery, as depicted by slave narratives. Kövecses (2000a) explores the system of emotion metaphors, making use of Talmy’s force dynamics. Lakoff (1987) contains, in case study one, a detailed examination of metaphors for sexual desire. Lakoff (1990, 1993) looks at metaphors for events and actions in general and ﬁnds that they are structured by movement and force as their source domains. Lakoff (1993, 1994) and Radden (1997) examine the concept of time as conceptualized in terms of moving objects. Evans (2004) is a book-length study of time. Fauconnier and Turner (2008) is a reappraisal of the metaphorical structure of time in terms of blending theory.
Lakoff (1992) contains a discussion of some of the most important metaphors for nation and politics. Lakoff (1996) explores in detail the American conception of morality and its relation to politics. This book also contains discussions of metaphors for God. Lakoff and Turner (1989) investigate metaphors for life and death, as well as time, in literary texts. Quinn (1987, 1991) offers intensive studies of the American view of marriage on the basis of interview materials. Radden (1995) describes idioms that have movement and direction as their source domain. Reddy (1979) is a study of the metaphors for communication and introduces some of the basic insights into the nature of metaphor in the cognitive linguistic view. Adamson et al. (1996) and Rohrer (1995) analyze the American political scene using the cognitive linguistic approach to metaphor. Sweetser (1990) contains a chapter in which she describes a system of metaphors for the mind and thought that she calls

30 METAPHOR
the Mind-as-Body metaphor. Talmy (1988) calls attention to the importance of “force dynamics” in the study of language and cognition; he treats the notion of force as a major source domain in the conceptualization of a variety of abstract concepts. Turner (1987) analyzes the system of kinship in English as a source domain in works of literature. Lakoff and Nunez (2000) investigate the metaphorical foundations of mathematics.
Books on the corpus linguistic treatment of conceptual metaphors include Deignan (2005), Charteris-Black (2004), and Stefanowitch and Gries, eds. (2007). Kövecses (2008 and in press) are a defense of conceptual metaphor theory against some of the criticism offered by corpus linguists.

1. Below you can read part of a magazine article from Time, June 10, 1996. What are the source and target domains of the italicized metaphorical expressions in the following passage?
Which way now? In this year of elections that could redirect history—in Israel, Russia, the U.S.—the ﬁrst has been decided. Israelis have picked a Prime Minister in conservative 46-year-old Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu. And the change in policies that this country will now pursue will have consequences affecting half the globe. Sometimes statesmen stumble blindly over an epochal crossroads they do not know is there. Others are given the chance to see the fork in the road ahead and decide deliberately which way to go. Folly, wrote historian Barbara Tuchman, is when leaders knowingly choose the wrong path. (“The Right Way to Peace?” p. 28)
2. In the chapter, you read about God being conceptualized in several different ways. Look at the following quotes from hymns (religious songs) and decide which conceptualization is used.
(a) Dearest children, God is near you, Watching o’er you day and night And delights to own and bless you If you strive to do what’s right.
(b) The Lord my pasture will prepare . . . feed me . . .

COMMON SOURCE AND TARGET DOMAINS 31
And guard me with a watchful eye My noonday walks he will attend And all my silent midnight hours defend.
(c) Beneath his watchful eye, His saints will securely dwell That hand which bears all nature up Shall guard his children well. Why should this anxious load Press down your wary mind Haste to your Heavenly Father’s throne And sweet refreshment ﬁnd.
3. The following quotation hides a different kind of religious conceptualization. How would you describe this? What metaphors do you recognize?
Jesus, Savior pilot me Over life’s tempestuous sea Unknown waves before me roll, Hiding rock and treach’rous shoal. Chart and compass came from thee: Jesus, Savior, pilot me.
4. In the chapter we described forces as one of the typical source domains. In the following metaphorical linguistic examples, identify the various kinds of forces and the abstract domains to which these forces apply.

Kinds of Metaphor
In chapter 1, we saw that metaphor can be characterized with the formula A IS B, where the target domain (a) is comprehended through a source domain (b). This comprehension is based on a set of mappings that exist between elements of a and elements of b. To know a conceptual metaphor is to know this set of mappings. It was also pointed out that metaphor in the cognitive linguistic view means primarily conceptual metaphor, as opposed to linguistic metaphor. That is, we distinguish between a conceptual metaphor with the form A IS B and its metaphorical linguistic expressions. The metaphorical expressions that characterize A IS B formulas are regarded as the linguistic realizations or manifestations of underlying conceptual metaphors. It was noted, however, that conceptual metaphors can be realized in other than linguistic ways (such as myths)—a point to which we return in chapter 5.
The question arises whether all conceptual metaphors are like the ones we have characterized so far. In this chapter, I show that there are distinct kinds of conceptual metaphor and that it is possible to classify metaphors in a variety of ways. These include classiﬁcations according to the conventionality, function, nature, and level of generality of metaphor. (In chapter 10, I further distinguish metaphors according to their complexity, classifying them as “simple” or “complex.”) It is possible to classify metaphors in several other ways, but these are the ways that play an especially important role in the cognitive linguistic view.
1. The Conventionality of Metaphor
A major way in which metaphors can be classiﬁed is their degree of conventionality. In other words, we can ask how well worn or how deeply entrenched a metaphor is in everyday use by ordinary people for everyday purposes. This use of the notion of conventionality is different from the
33

34 METAPHOR
way this concept is usually used in linguistics, semiotics, and the philosophy of language. The typical application of the term in these ﬁelds is synonymous with that of the term “arbitrary,” especially as this is used in explaining the nature of linguistic signs (where it is pointed out that “form” and “meaning” are related to each other in an arbitrary fashion). However, the term “conventional” is used here in the sense of well established and well entrenched. Thus, we can say that a metaphor is highly conventional or conventionalized (i.e., well established and deeply entrenched) in the usage of a linguistic community.
Since there are both conceptual metaphors and their corresponding linguistic expressions, the issue of conventionality concerns both conceptual metaphors and their linguistic manifestations. The metaphors, both conceptual and linguistic, we saw as examples in chapters 1 and 2 were all highly conventionalized, in that speakers of English use them naturally and effortlessly for their normal, everyday purposes when they talk about such concepts as argument, love, social organizations, life, and so on. Consider again the following metaphors:
argument is war: I defended my argument. love is a journey: We’ll just have to go our separate ways. theories are buildings: We have to construct a new theory. ideas are food: I can’t digest all these facts. social organizations are plants: The company is growing fast. life is a journey: He had a head start in life.
The metaphorical expressions given as illustrations of these conceptual metaphors are highly conventionalized; that is, they are well worn or even cliched. In fact, most speakers would not even notice that they use metaphor when they use the expression defend in connection with arguments, construct in connection with theories, go our separate ways in connection with love, grow in connection with company, digest in connection with ideas, or head start in connection with life. For native speakers of English, these are some of the most ordinary and natural ways to talk about these subject matters.
Conventional conceptual metaphors, such as argument is war, love is a journey, ideas are food, and theories are buildings, are deeply entrenched ways of thinking about or understanding an abstract domain, while conventional metaphorical linguistic expressions are well worn, cliched ways of talking about abstract domains. Thus, both conceptual and linguistic metaphors can be more or less conventional. For example, a conventional way of thinking about theories is in terms of buildings and about life in terms of a journey. In addition, there are conventional ways of talking about the same domains. Thus, we use the verb to construct to talk about some aspects of theories and the noun head start to talk about some aspects of life. It is customary to refer to the conventional nature of linguistic expressions with the adjective conventionalized and thus talk about conventionalized (rather than conventional) metaphorical linguistic expressions.

KINDS OF METAPHOR 35
Highly conventional metaphors are at one end of what we can call the scale of conventionality. At the opposite end of the scale, we ﬁnd highly unconventional or novel metaphors. To illustrate, let us give an example of both:
life is a journey (a) He had a head start in life. (b) Two roads diverged in a wood, and I—
I took the one less traveled by, And that has made all the difference.
Both of these examples are linguistic metaphors that manifest the same conceptual metaphor. The example in (b) comes from Robert Frost’s poem “The Road Not Taken.” Obviously, Frost uses the conventional life is a journey metaphor in unconventional ways. He employs linguistic expressions from the journey domain that have not been conventionalized for speakers of English; “two roads diverged” and “I took the one [road] less traveled by” are not worn out, cliched linguistic expressions to talk about life in English. As linguistic metaphors, they strike us as unconventional and novel, but the conceptual metaphor that they realize remains conventional. While it may be difﬁcult for most of us to conceive of life in other than the journey conceptual metaphor, we probably couldn’t ﬁnd these linguistic expressions in a dictionary or hear them every day from ordinary speakers for everyday purposes of communication.
These examples of the life is a journey conceptual metaphor appear to support the widespread view that novel metaphorical expressions have their source in poetry or literature. But unconventionalized metaphorical expressions do not only come from the realm of arts, strictly conceived. There are many creative speakers who can produce novel linguistic metaphors based on conventional conceptual metaphors. Some well-known categories of these speakers in English include sports journalists, politicians, (church) ministers, certain speakers of Black English, authentic users of slang, grafﬁti writers, writers of song lyrics, and others.
To give a couple of examples of this, consider ﬁrst the following cliché:
Stop the world. I want to get off.
Obviously, the author of this line had the conventional conceptual metaphor life is a journey in mind but used unconventionalized linguistic expressions that make it manifest.
Another conceptual metaphor for life is life is a sporting game. This is the metaphor that American politician Ross Perot used, when he commented in June 1992 on the nation’s high medical costs with the following words: “We’re buying a front row box seat, and we’re not even getting to see a bad show from the bleachers.” While he uses here a conventional conceptual metaphor for life, the linguistic expressions that he employs are unconventionalized.

36 METAPHOR
While it is easy to ﬁnd unconventionalized metaphorical linguistic expressions that realize conventional conceptual metaphors, it is less easy to ﬁnd unconventional conceptual metaphors for a given target domain. Take the concept of love, as an example. Love is metaphorically conceptualized in many ways; in addition to love is a journey, we understand it in terms of fire (burning with love), physical unity (We are as one), insanity (I’m madly in love), economic exchange (She invested a lot in that relationship), physical forces (She attracts me irresistibly), natural forces (He was swept off his feet), illness (She has it bad), magic (I’m enchanted), rapture (He was high on love), war (She eventually surrendered), game (She’s playing hard to get), and so on. These are all highly conventional ways of conceptualizing love; they are age-old and deeply entrenched ways of thought concerning love in Anglo-American (and even more generally in Western) culture. Do people think of love in terms of concepts other than these? Not really. Most people comprehend their love experiences and lead their love lives via such conventional conceptual metaphors. It seems that the understanding of love through these source domains provides a sufﬁciently comprehensive and coherent notion of the concept.
However, when experiences fall outside the range of these conventional mechanisms or when people cannot make sense of them in a coherent way, they may and often do employ less-conventional source domains. Lakoff and Johnson point out one such unconventional conceptual metaphor: love is a collaborative work of art. While the conventional metaphors mentioned above focus largely on passive aspects of romantic love, the collaborative work of art metaphor emphasizes the more action-oriented aspects of it. If love is a collaborative work of art, the two lovers should be able to work out their common goals, the premises of the work, the responsibilities that they do and do not share, the ratio of control and letting go in the creation, the costs and the beneﬁts of the project, and so on. It is clear that the notion of love will be very different for those who “live by” this metaphor. The unconventionality of this conceptual metaphor is shown by the fact that Lakoff and Johnson do not provide any metaphorical linguistic expressions to demonstrate it. The reason for this, in all probability, is that there are no such conventionalized expressions.
The love is a collaborative work of art metaphor is the product of two ordinary people attempting to make sense of their everyday love experiences. Artists, poets, and scientists also often do the same; they offer us new ways and possibilities in the form of new, unconventional conceptual metaphors to see the world around us. One example of this occurred when William P. Magee said at a United Nations meeting in 1993: “Life is a mirror. If you smile, it smiles back at you; if you frown, it frowns back.” life is a mirror is not a conventional conceptual metaphor; Magee used an inventive, unconventional metaphor.

KINDS OF METAPHOR 37
2. The Cognitive Function of Metaphor
When we ask what the function of metaphor is for ordinary people in thinking about and seeing the world, we’re asking a question about the cognitive function of metaphor. For the purposes of a clearer exposition, conceptual metaphors can be classiﬁed according to the cognitive functions that they perform. On this basis, three general kinds of conceptual metaphor have been distinguished: structural, ontological, and orientational. These kinds of metaphor often coincide in particular cases.
2.1. Structural Metaphors
So far in this book we have been concerned with what we call structural metaphors. In this kind of metaphor, the source domain provides a relatively rich knowledge structure for the target concept. In other words, the cognitive function of these metaphors is to enable speakers to understand target a by means of the structure of source b. As noted in chapter 1, this understanding takes place by means of conceptual mappings between elements of a and elements of b.
For example, the concept of time is structured according to motion and space. Given the time is motion metaphor, we understand time in the following way:
We understand time in terms of some basic elements: physical objects, their locations, and their motion.
There is a background condition that applies to this way of understanding time: the present time is at the same location as a canonical observer.
Given the basic elements and the background condition, we get the following mappings:
Times are things. The passing of time is motion. Future times are in front of the observer; past times are behind the
observer. One thing is moving, the other is stationary; the stationary thing is the
deictic center.
This set of mappings structures our notion of time in a clear way. The time is motion conceptual metaphor exists in the form of two special cases in English: time passing is motion of an object and time passing is an observer’s motion over a landscape.
In the ﬁrst version, the observer is ﬁxed and times are objects moving with respect to the observer. Times are oriented with their fronts in their direction of motion. For example:

38 METAPHOR
time passing is motion of an object The time will come when . . . The time has long since gone when . . . The time for action has arrived. In the weeks following next Tuesday . . . On the preceding day . . . I’m looking ahead to Christmas. Thanksgiving is coming up on us. Time is ﬂying by.
In the second version, times are ﬁxed locations and the observer is moving with respect to time. For example:
time passing is an observer’s motion over a landscape There’s going to be trouble along the road. His stay in Russia extended over many years. He passed the time happily. We’re coming up on Christmas. We’re getting close to Christmas.
The time is motion metaphor (as speciﬁed in the mappings and the differences in the two versions) accounts for a large number of linguistic metaphors in English. The mappings not only explain why the particular expressions mean what they do but also provide a basic overall structure, hence understanding, for our notion of time. Without the metaphor it would be difﬁcult to imagine what our concept of time would be. Most structural metaphors provide this kind of structuring and understanding for their target concepts.
2.2. Ontological Metaphors
Ontological metaphors provide much less cognitive structuring for target concepts than structural ones do. (Ontology is a branch of philosophy that has to do with the nature of existence.) Their cognitive job seems to be to “merely” give a new ontological status to general categories of abstract target concepts and to bring about new abstract entities. What this means is that we conceive of our experiences in terms of objects, substances, and containers, in general, without specifying exactly what kind of object, substance, or container is meant. Since our knowledge about objects, substances, and containers is rather limited at this general level, we cannot use these highly general categories to understand much about target domains. This is the job of structural metaphors, which provide an elaborate structure for abstract concepts, as discussed.
But it is nevertheless a cognitively important job to assign a basic status in terms of objects, substances, and the like to many of our experiences. The kinds of experiences that require this the most are those that are not clearly

KINDS OF METAPHOR 39

delineated, vague, or abstract. For example, we do not really know what the mind is, but we conceive of it as an object (note the use of the word what in the ﬁrst part of this sentence). This way we can attempt to understand more about it.
In general, ontological metaphors enable us to see more sharply delineated structure where there is very little or none.

Source Domains

Target Domains

physical object ⇒ nonphysical or abstract entities (e.g.,

the mind)

⇒ events (e.g., going to the race), actions (e.g.,

giving someone a call)

substance

⇒ activities (e.g., a lot of running in the game)

container

⇒ undelineated physical objects (e.g., a

clearing in the forest)

⇒ physical and nonphysical surfaces (e.g.,

land areas, the visual ﬁeld)

⇒ states (e.g., in love)

Given that undelineated experiences receive a more delineated status via ontological metaphors, speakers can use these metaphors for more speciﬁc jobs: (1) to refer to, to quantify, or to identify aspects of the experience that has been made more delineated. For example, conceiving of fear as an object, we can conceptualize it as “our possession.” Thus, we can linguistically refer to fear as my fear or your fear. Cases like this are the least noticeable types of conceptual metaphor. (2) Once a “nonthing” experience has received the status of a thing through an ontological metaphor, the experience so conceptualized can be structured further by means of structural metaphors. If we conceptualize the mind as an object, we can easily provide more structure for it by means of the “machine” metaphor for the mind (as in: “My mind is rusty this morning”).
We can conceive of personiﬁcation as a form of ontological metaphor. In personiﬁcation, human qualities are given to nonhuman entities. Personiﬁcation is common in literature, but it also abounds in everyday discourse, as the examples below show:

His theory explained to me the behavior of chickens raised in factories. Life has cheated me. Inﬂation is eating up our proﬁts. Cancer ﬁnally caught up with him. The computer went dead on me.

Theory, life, inﬂation, cancer, and computer are not humans, but they are given qualities of human beings, such as explaining, cheating, eating, catching up, and dying. Personiﬁcation makes use of one of the best source domains we have—ourselves. In personifying nonhumans as humans, we can begin to understand them a little better.

40 METAPHOR
2.3. Orientational Metaphors
Orientational metaphors provide even less conceptual structure for target concepts than ontological ones. Their cognitive job, instead, is to make a set of target concepts coherent in our conceptual system. The name “orientational metaphor” derives from the fact that most metaphors that serve this function have to do with basic human spatial orientations, such as up-down, center-periphery, and the like. It would perhaps be more appropriate to call this type of conceptual metaphor “coherence metaphor,” which would be more in line with the cognitive function these metaphors perform.
By “coherence,” we simply mean that certain target concepts tend to be conceptualized in a uniform manner. For example, all the following concepts are characterized by an “upward” orientation, while their “opposites” receive a “downward” orientation.
more is up; less is down: Speak up, please. Keep your voice down, please.
healthy is up; sick is down: Lazarus rose from the dead. He fell ill. conscious is up; unconscious is down: Wake up. He sank into a
coma. control is up; lack of control is down: I’m on top of the
situation. He is under my control. happy is up; sad is down: I’m feeling up today. He’s really low these
days. virtue is up; lack of virtue is down: She’s an upstanding citizen.
That was a low-down thing to do. rational is up; nonrational is down: The discussion fell to an
emotional level. He couldn’t rise above his emotions.
Upward orientation tends to go together with positive evaluation, while downward orientation with a negative one. But positive-negative evaluation is not limited to the spatial orientation up-down. It has been pointed out that various spatial image schemas are bipolar and bivalent. Thus, whole, center, link, balance, in, goal, and front are mostly regarded as positive, while their opposites, not whole, periphery, no link, imbalance, out, no goal, and back are seen as negative. Just to give one example, it is remarkable that in English the phrase half the man denotes someone who is not positively viewed, as in He is half the man he used to be. Obviously, the “whole” versus “not whole” opposition is at work here.
2.4. Understanding Metaphor
In light of the discussion of the cognitive function of conceptual metaphors in this section, we can return to the question raised in chapter 1: What does it mean that when we have a conceptual metaphor, one domain (concept) is used to understand another? It was pointed out in chapter 1 that metaphorical understanding can mean essentially two things (actually, even more, as Ray

KINDS OF METAPHOR 41
Gibbs’s work suggests). Metaphorical understanding can be the short-term process of comprehending something in real time, at the time of speaking or otherwise interpreting something. We can call this “online” understanding. Metaphorical understanding can also be based on long-term memory or as a result of a long-term historical-cultural process. In such cases comprehension takes place over a long stretch of time, as when the metaphorical meaning of a word goes back to a source domain (such as the time-related meaning of before and after derive from the space-related meaning of before and after). We can call this “ofﬂine” understanding. Now the question is whether the ofﬂine understanding of metaphors occurs with or without the activation of the source domain. Several researchers opposing conceptual metaphor theory as a theory of online understanding claim that the understanding of most of the highly conventional metaphorical language used as linguistic metaphors in conceptual metaphor theory is processed (understood) without the realtime activation of the source domains in question. Their claim is that we process highly conventional metaphorical expressions without (consciously or unconsciously) evoking or relying on metaphorical mappings.
However, several studies in the past decade or so have indicated that the comprehension of metaphorical expressions (i.e., understanding the target meaning) always takes place with the simultaneous activation of source domains, and not just understanding some metaphorical meaning independently of the source. In one study, Gibbs and his associates (1997) wanted to see how people immediately comprehend metaphorical idioms based on the anger is a hot fluid in a container metaphor, such as blow one’s stack. Participants read stories ending with idioms such as this and then quickly gave lexical decision responses to letter-strings that were presented to them visually. The letter-strings either had to do with or were unrelated to the conceptual metaphor underlying the idioms. For example, a related letter-string was “heat,” and an unrelated one was “lead.” People responded faster to the lexical decision questions after they were presented with a related letterstring than when they were with an unrelated one. Findings in a variety of tasks were consistent. This indicates that source domains are active at the time of processing (understanding) target-related metaphorical meanings.
In another set of experiments, Lera Boroditsky (2001) studied the time is horizontal/vertical metaphor by considering two kinds of primes (a prime is an early stimulus that prepares someone to respond to a later stimulus more easily than without it): a prime for horizontal orientation and a prime for vertical orientation. The distinction between horizontal and vertical primes is important because there are languages where time is conceived of as being oriented in both directions, vertically and horizontally (as opposed to English, where time is metaphorically viewed as horizontal only). One such language is Mandarin Chinese. Boroditsky hypothesized that if the time is horizontal/vertical metaphor is real in people’s conceptual systems, speakers of Mandarin should be faster than speakers of English in saying that a sentence like “March comes earlier than April” is true after getting a vertical prime, and speakers of English should be faster than Chinese

42 METAPHOR
speakers after getting a horizontal prime. These predictions proved to be correct. The time is horizontal conceptual metaphor must exist in the heads of speakers of English, and when it is primed, it produces faster TRUE/ FALSE responses to sentences like “March comes earlier than April.” And the same holds true for the existence of the time is vertical conceptual metaphor in the heads of Chinese speakers.
In the same experiment, half of the target sentences had a spatiotemporal metaphor in them. The sentence was “March comes before April.” This is different from the previous situation, in that before is a metaphorical expression (unlike earlier) that is based on the time is horizontal conceptual metaphor (together with such expressions as ahead of, after, and behind). If conceptual metaphors immediately affect online understanding, then people will respond faster to the TRUE/FALSE question after receiving the horizontal prime than after the vertical prime. The result of this part of the experiment was that both the English and Mandarin speakers needed less time to respond to the questions when they were presented with a horizontal prime than with a vertical prime. This is because the horizontal prime was consistent with the conceptual metaphor underlying the metaphorical expression before in the target sentence “March comes before April” (i.e., with the conceptual metaphor time is horizontal). The fact that the speakers of Mandarin Chinese were affected in the same way as speakers of English shows that they also made use of the time is horizontal conceptual metaphor in their online understanding of the sentence, because this was the metaphor triggered by the metaphorical expression used in the sentence (before) and it was consistent with the horizontal prime.
All this research shows that people do make use of conceptual metaphors when they comprehend metaphorical expressions online; the source domains are clearly activated in the real-time comprehension of target-related metaphorical meanings even in the case of highly conventional metaphorical expressions. Thus, “understanding” does involve conceptual metaphors in both the online and ofﬂine senses.
3. The Nature of Metaphor
Metaphors may be based on both knowledge and image. Most of the metaphors we have discussed so far are based on our basic knowledge of concepts. In them, basic knowledge structures constituted by some basic elements are mapped from a source to a target. In another kind of conceptual metaphor that can be called image-schema metaphor, however, it is not conceptual elements of knowledge (like traveler, destination, and obstacles in the case of journey) that get mapped from a source to a target, but conceptual elements of image-schemas. We began to see such conceptual metaphors in section 2,

KINDS OF METAPHOR 43
when we looked at orientational metaphors. Here we continue to examine such metaphors.
Let’s take the following examples with the word out:
pass out space out zone out tune out veg out conk out rub out snuff out out of order be out of something
These phrases have to do with events and states such as losing consciousness, lack of attention, something breaking down, death, and absence of something. All of them indicate a negative state of affairs. More important for the discussion of image-schema metaphors is that they map relatively little from source to target. As the name implies, metaphors of this kind have source domains that have skeletal image-schemas, such as the one associated with out. By contrast, structural metaphors are rich in knowledge structure and provide a relatively rich set of mappings between source and target.
Image-schemas are not limited to spatial relations, such as “in-out.” There are many other “schemas” that play a role in our metaphorical understanding of the world. These basic image-schemas derive from our interactions with the world: we explore physical objects by contact with them; we experience ourselves and other objects as containers with other objects in them or outside of them; we move around the world; we experience physical forces affecting us; and we also try to resist these forces, such as when we walk against the wind. Interactions such as these occur repeatedly in human experience. These basic physical experiences give rise to what are called imageschemas, and the image-schemas structure many of our abstract concepts metaphorically. Here are some examples:

Image-Schema in-out front-back up-down contact motion force

Metaphorical Extension I’m out of money. He’s an up-front kind of guy. I’m feeling low. Hold on, please. (“Wait”) He just went crazy. You’re driving me insane.

An interesting property of image-schemas is that they can serve as the basis of other concepts. Thus, for instance, the motion schema underlies the

44 METAPHOR
concept of a journey. The motion schema has the parts, initial point, movement, and end point, to which correspond in journeys the point of departure, the travel, and the destination. In this way, most apparently nonimage-schematic concepts (such as journey) seem to have an image-schematic basis. The target domains of many structural metaphors can then be seen as imageschematically structured by their source (such as life is a journey).
Other kinds of image-based conceptual metaphors are richer in imagistic detail but do not employ image schemas. We can call them image metaphors. They are found in both poetry and other kinds of discourse. Let’s look at some examples from slang:
(a) A. What ‘you doin’? B. Watering the plants. (b) He laid pipe.
Sentence (a) describes an act of urination, while (b) describes an act of copulation (or, for some speakers, defecation or both) in English slang. Both sentences use image metaphors that map a detailed set of images from the source to the target. Let us analyze sentence (a) as a demonstration of this point. In the sentence, the person watering the plants is the person urinating, the water is the urine, the watering can is the penis, the intended goal of the action of watering is the ground where the urine is directed. Notice that there is no general structural metaphor involved in this mapping. The mapping is of the one-shot kind generated by two images brought into correspondence by the superimposition of one image onto the other. These are one-shot image metaphors.
4. Levels of Generality of Metaphor
Conceptual metaphors can be classiﬁed according to the level of generality at which they are found. As already discussed, image-schemas are structures with very little detail ﬁlled in. For example, the “motion” schema has only initial location, movement along a path, and ﬁnal location. This highly generic motion schema gets ﬁlled in with more detail in the case of the concept of a journey: we may have a traveler, a point of departure, a means of travel (e.g., a car), a travel schedule, difﬁculties along the way, a destination, a guide, and so on. Another property of such generic-level schemas as “motion” is that they can be ﬁlled in not just one but in many ways. The motion schema can be realized not only as a journey but also as a walk, a run, a hike, or mountain climbing. These are speciﬁc-level instances of the generic motion schema. All of these would instantiate the schema in a different way, but they would have the same underlying generic-level structure of the motion schema.
Now conceptual metaphors can be generic-level or speciﬁc-level ones. The ones that we have discussed so far are all speciﬁc-level metaphors: life is a journey, an argument is war, ideas are food, and so on. Life, journey,

KINDS OF METAPHOR 45
argument, war, ideas, and food are speciﬁc-level concepts. Schematic structures underlying them are ﬁlled in a detailed way, as we have seen in the case of a journey. In addition to these, there are generic-level metaphors: events are actions, generic is specific, and what is known as the great chain metaphor (I discuss this last one in chapter 11). As can be seen, concepts such as events, actions, generic, and speciﬁc are all generic-level concepts. They are deﬁned by only a small number of properties, which is to say that they are characterized by extremely skeletal structures. For example, in the case of events, an entity undergoes some change typically caused by some external force. There are many different kinds of events: dying, burning, loving, inﬂation, getting sick, freezing, the wind blowing, and more. These are all speciﬁc instances of the generic concept of event. Unlike the generic-level concept of event, the speciﬁc cases are ﬁlled in with speciﬁc detail. For example, in death there is an entity, typically a human, who gets old or gets sick, as a result of which he or she ceases to exist. Notice that the characterization of event does not mention any of these elements. However, the general structure of death shares the skeletal structure of generic event: in death, an entity undergoes some change as a result of some force (time-age or illness).
Generic-level metaphors are designed to perform special jobs—jobs that are different from those of speciﬁc-level metaphors that we have examined so far. The events are actions metaphor, for example, accounts for many cases of personiﬁcation, as I discuss in chapter 4. The generic is specific metaphor helps us interpret proverbs and other cliched phrases. Proverbs often consist of speciﬁc-level concepts. Take the proverb “The early bird catches the worm.” “Bird,” “catch,” and “worm” are speciﬁc-level concepts. The interpretation of the proverb is facilitated by the metaphor generic is specific. It tells us to interpret the proverb at a generic level: the early bird is anyone who does something ﬁrst, catching is obtaining something, and the worm is anything obtained before others. Thus, the generic meaning of the proverb is something like “If you do something ﬁrst, you will get what you want before others get it.” Given this generic-level interpretation, the proverb can apply to a wide range of cases that have this generic structure. One such case is when you go and stand in line early for a ticket to a popular Broadway show and you do get a ticket, while others who come later do not. This example shows how the generic is specific metaphor can give us a generic-level interpretation of a speciﬁc-level proverb and then allows us to apply the generic interpretation to a speciﬁc case that has the appropriate underlying generic structure.
SUMMARY
Metaphors can be conceptual and linguistic. Conceptual metaphors involve two concepts and have the form A is B, where concept A is understood in terms of concept B. Linguistic metaphors, or metaphorical linguistic expressions, are linguistic manifestations of conceptual metaphors.

46 METAPHOR
Metaphors can be classiﬁed in many ways. Four of these are especially relevant to the cognitive linguistic view of metaphor; classiﬁcation according to the conventionality, function, nature, and level of generality of metaphor.
Both linguistic and conceptual metaphors may be highly conventionalized or they may be unconventional, or novel. We have seen that a highly conventional conceptual metaphor may receive expression by means of a highly unconventional metaphorical linguistic expression.
According to their cognitive function, conceptual metaphors can be of three kinds: structural, orientational, and ontological. Structural metaphors map the structure of the source domain onto the structure of the target and in this way allow speakers to understand one domain in terms of another. Orientational metaphors have primarily an evaluative function. They make large groups of metaphors coherent with each other. Ontological metaphors provide extremely fundamental but very crude understanding for target concepts. These fundamental but crude understandings often serve as the bases of structural metaphors. Conceptual metaphors may use both propositional knowledge and images of various kinds (including not only visual images). Images that have extremely general schematic structure are called “image-schemas.” Imageschemas of various sorts, such as the container or force schemas, structure many abstract concepts metaphorically. Images that are not based on recurrent experience with a generic structure but capture a speciﬁc experience are called “one-shot images.” These can also participate in metaphorical understanding.
Conceptual metaphors can also be speciﬁc-level and generic-level. Most conceptual metaphors employ concepts that are at a speciﬁc level of generality. Some conceptual metaphors are generic-level, such as events are actions and generic is specific. Generic-level metaphors have special jobs designed for them in the working of our metaphorical conceptual system.
Recent research indicates that source domains are activated in the real-time or online comprehension of target-related metaphorical meanings. This happens even in the case of highly conventional metaphorical expressions.
FURTHER READING
Lakoff and Johnson (1980) and Lakoff and Turner (1989) discuss the varying degrees of conventionality of metaphor. Conceptual metaphors of the structural, orientational, and ontological kinds were introduced by Lakoff and Johnson (1980). The role of images and image-schemas in metaphorical understanding is emphasized by Lakoff (1987) and Johnson (1987), as well as by Talmy (1988) and Sweetser (1990). Lakoff and Turner (1989) draw the distinction between speciﬁc-level and generic-level metaphors. Krzeszowski (1993) discusses the evaluative function of many image-schemas. Fauconnier and Turner (2008) offer a new analysis of metaphors related to time.
Several experiments indicate that metaphor understanding always takes place with the activation of the source domain. Gibbs et al. (1997) and Boroditsky (2001) are examples of such studies. Authors who argue against the automatic activation of source domains include Glucksberg et al. (1993), Keysar et al. (2000), and others.

Metaphor in Literature
What is the relationship between the metaphors used in ordinary language and those used in literature, including poetry? Do literary metaphors constitute a distinct and independent category from ordinary metaphors? There is a widespread notion among lay people and scholars alike that the “real” source of metaphor is in literature and the arts. It is believed that it is the creative genius of the poet and the artist that creates the most authentic examples of metaphor. When we examine this notion from the point of view of cognitive linguistics, we ﬁnd that the idea is only partially true and that everyday language and the everyday conceptual system contribute a great deal to the working of the artistic genius.
This is not to claim, however, that poets and writers never create new, original metaphors. They obviously do. And when they produce new metaphors, these often “jump out” from the text; they have a tendency to be noteworthy by virtue of their frequently anomalous or strange character. Consider the following example (analyzed in Gibbs, 1994) from Gabriel García Márquez’s novel Love in the Time of Cholera:
Once he tasted some chamomile tea and sent it back, saying only, “This stuff tastes of window.” Both she and the servants were surprised because they had never heard of anyone who had drunk boiled window, but when they tried the tea in an effort to understand, they understood: it did taste of window.
What is tea like that tastes like window? This is obviously an unconventional metaphor that was created by the author in order to offer a new and different perspective on an aspect of reality. Original, creative literary metaphors such as this are typically less clear but richer in meaning than either everyday metaphors or metaphors in science.

1. Ordinary and Poetic Language
But original, creative literary metaphors of the structural kind seem to be less frequent in literature than those metaphors that are based on our everyday, ordinary conceptual system. One of the startling discoveries of work on poetic language by cognitive linguists is the recognition that most poetic language is based on conventional, ordinary conceptual metaphors. As a ﬁrst example to demonstrate this point, let us take the following poem by the nineteenth-century poet Christina Georgina Rossetti:
Does the road wind up-hill all the way? Yes, to the very end. Will the day’s journey take the whole long day? From morn to night, my friend.
But is there for the night a resting place? A roof for when the slow, dark hours begin. May not the darkness hide it from my face? You cannot miss that inn.
Shall I meet other wayfarers at night? Those who have gone before. Then must I knock or call when just in sight? They will not keep you standing at that door.
Shall I ﬁnd comfort, travel-sore and weak? Of labour you shall ﬁnd the sum. Will there be beds for me and all who seek? Yea, beds for all who come.
Is this poem about a day’s hard journey to an inn at the end of a road winding uphill? It is unlikely that anyone would interpret it this way. We can be fairly certain that it is concerned with issues of life and death. But what makes us so conﬁdent that the poem has this “deeper,” underlying interpretation? Given the cognitive linguistic view of metaphor, we can suggest that our judgment is based on a conceptual metaphor that links life and death to a journey. The metaphor is by now well known to us: life is a journey and death is the end of the journey. Although life and death are not mentioned at all in the poem, the journey metaphor for life and death guides us in making sense of the poem. This interpretation is reinforced by additional metaphors that are employed in the poem and that are conventional in our everyday conceptual system as well. The line “From morn to night, my friend” evokes the a lifetime is a day metaphor; the words “for when the slow, dark hours begin” evoke the conventional metaphor life is light; death is dark; the line “But is there for the night a resting place?” evokes the conventional metaphors death is night and death is rest; etc. These conventional metaphors that are part of our everyday conceptual system guide and direct us to the idea that the poem is not simply about a journey during the day that

METAPHOR IN LITERATURE 51
ends at night but about life and death. We feel that this is a natural interpretation because the metaphors that link the concept of journey to the concepts of life and death are so natural.
Now let us examine another poem, one by Emily Dickinson:
I taste a liquor never brewed From tankards scooped in pearl. Not all the Frankfort berries Yield such an alcohol.
Inebriate of air am I And debauchee of dew, Reeling through endless summer days From inns of molten blue.
When landlords turn the drunken bee Out of the foxglove’s door, When butterﬂies renounce their drams, I shall but drink the more,
Till seraphs swing their snowy hats And saints to windows run To see the little tippler From the manzanilla come!
How do we know that this is a love poem? This is not a completely trivial question, since the word love does not occur in the poem at all. Again, part of the answer is that our interpretation of the poem is guided by certain metaphors that we are thoroughly familiar with. As noted in chapter 3, love is conceptualized metaphorically in many ways. These conventional metaphors include love is a nutrient and love is a rapture. Some everyday linguistic examples for them include “I’m sustained by love,” “I’m starved for your affection,” and “I’m drunk with love.” There is some conceptual overlap between these two metaphors, in that alcohol that can produce rapture is also a nutrient. We can see the poem as a poetic example of these overlapping metaphors.
As a ﬁnal illustration, let us take a look at the poem of a seventeenthcentury American poet, Anne Bradstreet, titled “To My Dear and Loving Husband:”
If ever two were one, then surely we. If man were loved by wife, then thee; If ever wife was happy in a man, Compare with me, ye women, if you can. I prize thy love more than whole mines of gold Or all the riches that the East doth hold. My love is such that rivers cannot quench, Nor ought but love from thee, give recompense. Thy love is such I can no way repay. The heavens reward thee manifold, I pray.

52 METAPHOR
Then while we live, in love let’s so persevere That when we live no more, we may live ever.
This poem also seems to be based on familiar, conventional metaphors of love: love is a unity (as in “She is my better half” and “We’re inseparable”), love is an economic exchange (as in “I’m putting more into this than you are”), love is a nutrient: food or drink (as in “I’m sustained by love”), and love is fire (as in “Betty was my old ﬂame”)—the last one depending on our interpretation of the word quench in the poem. Although the verb quench can be interpreted as an example of both nutrient (food/drink) and fire, in this particular case the latter interpretation seems to be the one intended by the poet (assuming the inﬂuence of the Bible on the author’s images). This is what the King James Version of the Bible says in the Song of Solomon (8: 6, 7):
Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm: for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave: the coals thereof are coals of ﬁre, which has the most vehement ﬂame.
Many waters cannot quench love, neither cannot ﬂoods drown it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for love, it would utterly
be contemned.
All of the conceptual metaphors mentioned above in the Bible are made use of in the poem as well:
If ever two were one, then surely we.—love is a unity Thy love is such I can no way repay.—love is an economic exchange My love is such that rivers cannot quench,—love is a nutrient/fire
In this section, we have dealt with only three examples, but there are many more similar cases. They point to the same general conclusion: that the metaphors used by poets are based on everyday conventional metaphors. Gibbs, following Lakoff and Turner, puts this in the following way:
My claim is that much of our conceptualization of experience is metaphorical, which both motivates and constrains the way we think creatively. The idea that metaphor constrains creativity might seem contrary to the widely held belief that metaphor somehow liberates the mind to engage in divergent thinking. (1994, p. 7)
Ordinary metaphors, then, are not things that poets and writers leave behind when they do their “creative” work. On the contrary, accumulating evidence suggests that “creative” people make heavy use of conventional, everyday metaphors and that their creativity and originality actually derive from them. But now we are faced with a new question: How does this exactly happen? What is the more precise relationship, then, between ordinary and literary metaphors?

METAPHOR IN LITERATURE 53
2. Poetic Reworking of Ordinary Metaphors
George Lakoff, Mark Turner, and Ray Gibbs have pointed out that poets regularly employ several devices to create novel unconventional language and “images” from the conventional materials of everyday language and thought. These include extending, elaboration, questioning, and combining.
2.1. Extending In extending, a conventional conceptual metaphor associated with certain conventionalized linguistic expressions is expressed by new linguistic means based on introducing a new conceptual element in the source domain. We saw an example of this by Robert Frost in chapter 3:
Two roads diverged in a wood, and I— I took the one less travelled by. And that has made all the difference.
The example employs the conventional metaphor life is a journey and expresses it in a novel way. What is novel here is the element that in the case of two roads leading to the same destination one road may be more or less traveled than the other. The same conventional metaphor is extended in Dante’s Divine Comedy:
In the middle of life’s road I found myself in a dark wood.
The novelty here derives from the unconventional element that life’s road may pass through a dark wood. Dante extends the metaphor by adding this unconventional aspect to it. What we ﬁnd in common in the two cases is that both poets take the life is a journey conventional metaphor and describe it by means of unconventionalized language that is conceptually based on an “unused” element of the source.
2.2. Elaboration Elaboration is different from extension, in that it elaborates on an existing element of the source in an unusual way. Instead of adding a new element to the source domain, it captures an already existing one in a new, unconventional way. A good example of this is provided by Adrienne Rich’s “The Phenomenology of Anger”:
Fantasies of murder: not enough: to kill is to cut off from pain. but the killer goes on hurting

54 METAPHOR
Not enough. When I dream of meeting the enemy, this is my dream:
white acetylene ripples from my body effortlessly released perfectly trained on the true enemy
raking his body down to the thread of existence burning away his lie leaving him in a new world; a changed man.
When we understand this poem, we activate in our mind one of the most conventional metaphors for anger: anger is a hot fluid in a container. This perfectly ordinary metaphor is seen in such everyday linguistic examples as “boiling with anger,” “making one’s blood boil,” “simmer down,” “blowing your stack,” and many others. In Rich’s poem, the hot ﬂuid gets elaborated as acetylene and the passive event of explosion is replaced by directing the dangerous substance of acetylene at the target of anger. When Rich modiﬁes the hot ﬂuid and turns it into a dangerous substance, she performs the (unconscious) act of elaborating on an everyday metaphor. A large part of the intuitive appeal of the poem derives from our (possibly unconscious) recognition of this familiar and completely mundane metaphorical view of anger.
2.3. Questioning
In the poetic device of questioning, poets can call into question the very appropriateness of our common everyday metaphors. To see an example of this, consider the following lines:
Suns can set and return again, but when our brief light goes out, there’s one perpetual night to be slept through.
(Catullus 5)
Here Catullus points out that at death some of our most common metaphors for life and death, a lifetime is a day and death is night, cease to be appropriate. They become inappropriate because death is “one perpetual night to be slept through,” which means that metaphorical death-as-night does not turn into day again: once we die, we do not live again. In other words, while the metaphors of a lifetime is a day and death is night are preserved, their validity or appropriateness is called into question. A consequence of the metaphorical source domains (that day becomes night and night becomes day) does not apply to the target domains (life becomes death, but death does not become life again). Catullus observes that the metaphors are only partially appropriate.

METAPHOR IN LITERATURE 55
Another example of demonstrating the mechanism of questioning is found in Margaret Freeman’s article, which stated that “much of Dickinson’s poetry is structured by the extent to which she rejected the dominant metaphor of her religious environment, that of life is a journey through time, and replaced it with a metaphor more in accordance with the latest scientiﬁc discoveries of her day, that of life is a voyage in space” (1995, 643). Thus, the cognitive mechanism of questioning the validity of accepted metaphors may be part of the “creed” of an artist.
2.4. Combining
Combining is perhaps the most powerful mechanism to go beyond our everyday conceptual system (but still using the materials of everyday conventional thought). Let’s take the following lines from one of Shakespeare’s sonnets:
In me thou seest the twilight of such day As after sunset fadeth in the west; Which by and by black night doth take away, Death’s second self that seals up all in rest.
(Sonnet 73)
These lines combine at least ﬁve everyday conceptual metaphors: light is a substance, events are actions, life is a precious possession, a lifetime is a day, and life is light. The process of combining can activate, and thus be based on, several everyday metaphors at the same time. Let’s take the clause “black night doth take away [the twilight].” In this single clause, we ﬁnd the following metaphors combined.
black: lifetime is a day, life is light, death is night night: death is night, life is light take away: life is a precious possession, events are actions
3. Personiﬁcation
I brieﬂy introduced personiﬁcation in chapter 3 and showed that it occurs in everyday conventional language. Personiﬁcation is a metaphorical device that is also used commonly in literature. This aspect of poetic language has been studied extensively from a cognitive linguistic view by George Lakoff and Mark Turner. One of the abstract concepts that is frequently personiﬁed in literature is time. We ﬁnd time personiﬁed in several ways:
time is a thief How soon hath Time, the subtle thief of youth, Stolen on his wing my three and twentieth years!
(Milton, Sonnet 7)

56 METAPHOR
time is a reaper Love’s not Time’s fool, though rosy lips and cheeks Within his bending sickle’s compass come.
(Shakespeare, Sonnet 116)
time is a devourer Time, the devourer of everything
(Ovid, Metamorphoses 15)
time is a destroyer Does it really exist, Time, the destroyer? When will it crush the fortress on the peaceful height?
(Rainer Maria Rilke, Sonnets to Orpheus, 2)
time is an evaluator Time! the Corrector where our judgments err.
(Byron, Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage) Time is a great legalizer, even in the ﬁeld of morals.
(Mencken, A Book of Prefaces)
time is a pursuer But at my back I always hear Time’s winged chariot hurrying near.
(Marvell, “To His Coy Mistress”)
Personiﬁcation permits us to use knowledge about ourselves to comprehend other aspects of the world, such as time, death, natural forces, inanimate objects, etc. One important question that arises in connection with personiﬁcation is why we use the kinds of persons that we do for a target. Speciﬁcally, why do we use the source domains above (representing different kinds of persons) to understand time? Lakoff and Turner suggest that the answer has to do with the events are actions generic-level metaphor. Given this metaphor, we comprehend external events as actions. This entails an important consequence; namely, that we view events as produced by an active, willful agent. That is, since actions have such an agent, we will view events in the same way. The result will be the personiﬁcation of events, such as time and death. Time is an external event that occurs independently from human beings, and thus, it can be seen as an agent, like a thief, reaper, pursuer, and so on.
But why these particular agents? This is in part because we have certain metaphors for the concepts that time affects: life, people, and so on. For example, given that life is a precious possession, time can be conceptualized as a thief that steals that precious possession; and given that people are plants, time can be conceptualized as a reaper that can kill people. More generally, we understand time nonmetaphorically as a changer, an entity that can affect people and things, especially in adverse ways. This knowledge about time explains many of the personiﬁcations we use for time. Many other abstract concepts, such as death, can be analyzed in similar ways.

Poetry abounds in image-based conceptual metaphors that are rich in imagistic detail but do not use image-schemas. Consider the following example from poetry:
My wife . . . whose waist is an hourglass. (example taken from Lakoff and Turner, 1989)
Here we have two detailed images: one for the body of a woman, and one for an hourglass. The images are based on the shape of the two “objects.” According to the metaphor, we take the image of the detailed shape of the hourglass and map it onto the detailed shape of the woman’s body. What is especially noteworthy is that the words themselves in the metaphor do not say anything about which part of the hourglass should be mapped onto which part of the woman’s body. Yet we know exactly which part maps onto which on the basis of the common shape. This is what makes image metaphors conceptual as well, rather than simply linguistic.
5. “Megametaphors”
Some metaphors, conventional or novel, may run through entire literary texts without necessarily “surfacing.” What one sometimes ﬁnds at the surface level of a literary text are speciﬁc micrometaphors, but “underlying” these metaphors is a megametaphor that makes these surface micrometaphors coherent. Megametaphors, or extended metaphors (not to be confused with the device of extension discussed above), have been studied by Paul Werth, who offers an excerpt from Dylan Thomas’s work Under Milk Wood for illustration of this idea:
It is spring, moonless night in the small town, starless and bible-black, the cobblestreets silent and the hunched, courter’s-and-rabbits’ wood limping invisible down to the sloeblack, slow, black, crowblack, ﬁshingboatbobbing sea. The houses are blind as moles (though moles see ﬁne tonight in the snouting velvet dingles) or blind as Captain Cat there in the mufﬂed middle by the pump and the town clock, the shops in mourning, and the Welfare Hall in widow’s weeds. And all the people of the lulled and dumbfound town are sleeping now. (Quoted in Werth, 1994, p. 84)
In the passage, inanimate things are characterized in terms of human properties: “the wood is hunched,” “the wood is limping invisible down to the sea,” “the houses are blind,” “the middle of the town is mufﬂed,” “the shops are in mourning.” The process of personiﬁcation is at work here, in which some properties of a town are understood in terms of the properties of human

58 METAPHOR
beings. We could propose a number of speciﬁc, surface metaphors to account for the particular linguistic examples. For instance, we could say that darkness is viewed as blindness, silence as being mufﬂed, roundness as being hunched, abstract movement as limping, and being unguarded as being lulled. But this would not explain why all the human properties that are mapped onto the aspects of the town are speciﬁc disabilities, such as blindness, being mufﬂed, being hunched, limping, and so on.
According to Werth, there is a megametaphor, or extended metaphor, here: sleep is disability. This metaphor provides a certain “undercurrent” to the micrometaphors that appear on the surface of the text. The connection between sleep is physical disability and the concept of town is provided by the metonymy the town stands for its inhabitants (or more generally, the place stands for the people in that place). The megametaphor becomes especially interesting if we consider that the concept of sleep often functions as a source domain for the concept of death. Since death is viewed as sleep and sleep is understood as a disability, death will also be seen as a disability: the utmost human disability in which we are blind, deaf, dumb, immobile, and the like. The identiﬁcation of sleep with death is already preﬁgured in the passage quoted above, where the author frequently mentions blackness, darkness, and even mourning. In later passages of the work, Dylan Thomas makes this connection explicit. For example: “Only you can see, in the blinded bedrooms . . . the yellowing, dickybirdwatching pictures of the dead” (quoted in ibid., p. 3). Thus, the town is conceived as dead through a complex interaction of speciﬁc metaphors, metonymy, and an extended metaphor that runs through the text.
A further remarkable aspect of extended metaphors has to do with literary criticism. Donald Freeman (1995) analyzed the text of Shakespeare’s Macbeth with the machinery of cognitive linguistics. He found two extended metaphors that account for most of the language, characters, settings, events, and plot of this play: the path (motion) and the container (in-out) schemas. He found that Macbeth’s career is largely characterized by paths and containers. For example, Macbeth says:
I am in blood Stepped in so far that, should I wade no more, Returning were as tedious as go o’er” (3.4.136–138).
The path of Macbeth’s career requires him to return, but he cannot anymore. Now what is interesting in connection with the critical work of this play is that the critics invariably use the same language and conceptualization of the work that the work itself uses. In other words, literary critics employ path and container metaphors to assess Macbeth. For instance, the path schema is clear in most literary critics’ work, including W. Richardson’s description (“[Macbeth] rushes headlong on his bane”) and, more recently, in Robert Watson’s formulation: “Macbeth ﬁnds himself on a linear course into winter..” Don Freeman concludes that these facts demonstrate a “unity of

METAPHOR IN LITERATURE 59
the language of and about Macbeth, as well as the unity of opinion about that unity” (1995, p. 707), which all arise from the source domains that the path and container schemas provide. It seems that the notion of extended metaphor offers new ways of understanding not only the text of the literary work but also the language and thought of the critics.
SUMMARY
Do literary metaphors constitute a special set among metaphors? Sometimes they do, but most of the time poets and writers use the same conceptual metaphors that ordinary people do. Nevertheless, we feel that literary metaphors are somehow special. This is because ordinary conceptual metaphors are regularly transformed by poets and writers in a number of ways: by (1) extending, (2) elaboration, (3) questioning, and (4) combining.
Personiﬁcation is another common device used in literary texts. In this chapter, I show why the abstract concept of time is personiﬁed the way it is. I explain this with the help of the generic-level metaphor events are actions.
Literary texts also abound in image-based metaphors. These are one-shot images that require the mapping of several elements of one image onto another. Although people are not explicitly instructed about which element of one image maps onto which element of another, they can perform the mappings successfully in the process of interpreting literary texts. Some metaphors extend through entire literary texts or large portions of them. These are called “extended metaphors” or “megametaphors.” They may not explicitly “surface” in the texts at all but tend to appear in the form of what we call “micrometaphors.”
FURTHER READING
The foundational work for the analysis of the relationship between everyday and poetic metaphor is Lakoff and Turner (1989). They write in detail about the devices that poets use to turn ordinary metaphors into poetic ones, as well as about image metaphors and personiﬁcation. Turner (1987) is an early formulation of how conceptual metaphor theory helps us elucidate several issues in the study of literary texts. Turner (1991) describes the place and role of cognitive linguistics in the study of English in general. Gibbs (1994) continues in the direction set by Lakoff and Turner, extending the analysis to ﬁction, formulating the key insights in a clear way, and offering psycholinguistic evidence for the claims made by cognitive linguists. Jackendoff and Aaron’s (1991) review article provides a critical assessment of the Lakoff-Turner view.
Werth (1994) analyzes megametaphors in ﬁction, while D. Freeman (1995) looks at them in Shakespeare’s Macbeth. M. Freeman (1995, 2000) writes about Emily Dickinson’s poetry using the machinery of cognitive linguistics, and she outlines a theory of “cognitive poetics.” Barcelona (1995) demonstrates the usefulness of the approach in an analysis of love metaphors in Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. Steen (1994) provides a wide-ranging study of how people understand metaphors in literary texts. Goatley (1997) offers a panoramic view

of the study of metaphor in literature. Semino (1997) is another useful source for studying metaphoric language in literature.
More recent work includes Stockwell (2002), which devotes a chapter to conceptual metaphor theory, and the accompanying edited volume by Gavins and Steen (2003). Major authoritative surveys of the application of cognitive metaphor theory (and other cognitive processes) to the study of literature are M. Freeman (2007) and Semino and Steen (2008).

1. What are the conventional metaphors here, and what device is used to make them unconventional? Give the resulting unconventional metaphor.
Drink to me only with thine eyes And I will pledge with mine Or leave a kiss but in the cup And I’ll not look for wine The thirst that from the soul doth rise Doth ask a drink divine But might I of Jove’s nectar sup I would not change for thine. (Ben Jonson, “Song to Celia”)
2. In “The Fall of the House of Usher,” Edgar Allan Poe uses a ballad, “The Haunted Palace,” to illustrate the story and characterize the Usher family. In the ballad, the central image is that of a palace which corresponds to the human body. Try to work out the metaphors, together with the mappings, that are present in the poem.
I. In the greenest of our valleys, By good angels tenanted, Once a fair and stately palace— Snow-white palace—reared its head. In the monarch Thought’s dominion— It stood there! Never seraph spread a pinion Over fabric half so fair.
II. Banners yellow, glorious, golden, On its roof did ﬂoat and ﬂow; (This—all this—was in the olden Time long ago) And every gentle air that dallied, In that sweet day, Along the ramparts plumed and pallid, A winged odor went away.
III. Wanderers in that happy valley Through two luminous windows saw Spirits moving musically To a lute’s well-tuned law,

Round about a throne, where sitting (Porphyrogene!) In state his glory well beﬁtting, The sovereign of the realm was seen.
IV. And all with pearl and ruby glowing Was the fair palace door, Through which came ﬂowing, ﬂowing, ﬂowing, And sparking evermore, A troop of Echoes whose sole duty Was but to sing, In voices of surpassing beauty, The wit and wisdom of their king.
V. But evil things, in robes of sorrow, Assailed the monarch’s high estate; (ah, let us mourn, for never morrow Shall dawn upon him, desolate!) And, round about his home, the glory That blushed and bloomed Is but a dim-remembered story Of the old time entombed.
VI. And travellers now within that valley, Through the red-litten windows, see Vast forms that move fantastically To a discordant melody; While, like a rapid ghastly river, Through the pale door, A hideous throng rush out forever, And laugh—but smile no more.
3. You have already seen how conceptual metaphors work in the case of myths: Oedipus’s life was saved because he possibly made use of certain conceptual metaphors when answering the riddle of the Sphinx. Read Henry James’s short story “The Beast in the Jungle.” In this story, tension arises from the fact that the main characters, May Bartram and John Marcher become involved in a puzzle similar to the riddle of the sphinx in the Oedipus-myth. Which conceptual metaphor should Marcher have known in order to make sense of and solve the riddle that the sphinx-like female character poses to him?
4. Which common everyday metaphor(s) do the following slogans found in advertisements call into question? Look for other advertisements (in newspapers, among TV ads) which make use of the same metaphors.

It is obvious today that America has defaulted on [the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence] insofar as her citizens of color are concerned. Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check; a check which has come back marked “insufﬁcient funds.” We refuse to believe that the Bank of Justice is bankrupt. We refuse to believe that there are insufﬁcient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation. So we have come to cash this check—a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice.

Nonlinguistic
Realizations of
Conceptual
Metaphors
As has been emphasized so far, metaphors are conceptual in nature. It was shown, furthermore, that conceptual metaphors have linguistic manifestations. We have called these manifestations “metaphorical linguistic expressions.” But if metaphors are primarily conceptual, then they must manifest themselves in other than linguistic ways. That is, if the conceptual system that governs how we experience the world, how we think, and how we act is partly metaphorical, then the (conceptual) metaphors must be realized not only in language but also in many other areas of human experience. These manifestations are called the realizations of conceptual metaphors.
In this chapter, I offer some examples of cases where conceptual metaphors manifest themselves or are realized—mainly in nonlinguistic ways. The list of cases I present is no doubt incomplete, but the reader may look for other ways in which conceptual metaphors are realized. Many of the cases brieﬂy described below come from George Lakoff’s (1993) work.
1. Movies and Acting
Films may be structured in their entirety in terms of conceptual metaphors. One metaphor that is particularly well suited for this is, of course, the life is a journey metaphor. Several movies depict a person’s life as a journey of some kind.
In addition, individual images in a movie may be based on one or several conceptual metaphors. In the Walt Disney movie Pocahontas, for example, one scene shows how Pocahontas and Captain John Smith fall in love with each other. The images through which this is conveyed include Pocahontas and Smith cascading down a waterfall. This image is a realization of the conceptual metaphor falling in love is physical falling. In another Walt Disney production, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, the cruel judge of Paris
63

64 METAPHOR
feels an uncontrollable sexual desire for the beautiful gypsy girl Esmeralda. In this scene, the entire room and the palace where the scene takes place is covered in ﬂames. The metaphor that is given visual expression here is sexual desire is fire. But metaphorical realization does not occur only in Walt Disney productions. It is part and parcel of making classic movies as well. In the ﬁlm Phaedra, the same sexual desire is fire metaphor is realized when Phaedra (played by Melina Mercouri) and Alexis (played by the young Anthony Perkins) begin to make love in front of an intense ﬁre in the ﬁreplace. Obviously, the intense ﬁre corresponds to the intense sexual desire of the lovers.
A major conceptual metaphor for difﬁculty is difficulties are burdens. Sometimes people do “act out” this metaphor, when they walk in such a way that suggests carrying a heavy load on one’s shoulders. In these cases, physical symptoms can be seen as “enactments” of conceptual metaphors. A large part of learning the profession of acting involves learning how to act out certain conceptual metaphors.
2. Cartoons, Drawings, Sculptures, and Buildings
Cartoons are another rich source for the nonlinguistic realization of metaphors. In them, conceptual metaphors are often depicted in a “literal” way. An angry man may be drawn with smoke coming out of his ears. This is based on the anger is a hot fluid in a container metaphor. Furthermore, given the same metaphor, in a cartoon an angry person may literally explode or burst open.
Children often draw pictures that visually embody conceptual metaphors. A common metaphor (more precisely, personiﬁcation) that is made use of by children is inanimate objects are people. In a picture drawn by a ﬁve-year-old boy, for example, a house is personiﬁed. In this way, the house assumes many of the properties of human beings and is therefore structured conceptually in terms of this metaphor.
In sculptures as well, conceptual metaphors are often “enacted.” For example, the sculpture of two people in love can be such that they are bound together or are inside each other or very close to each other, making real the metaphors love is a bond, love is a unity, and love is closeness, respectively. Another metaphor that seems to underlie many sculptures is significant is big. This is especially clear in the case of what is known in art history as the “social realist” style, in which people are usually represented as oversized heroes, suggesting their presumed importance.
The same metaphor can be found in architecture, for example, in the pyramids of Egypt, which were meant to show the signiﬁcance of the ruler buried in it. The structure of buildings may also make manifest certain metaphors. Church architecture is a good example. Christian churches are built so that they point toward the sky, the assumed place where God lives, which seems to be based on the metaphor god is up. Thus, Christian churches

NONLINGUISTIC REALIZATIONS OF CONCEPTUAL METAPHORS 65
metaphorically represent the connection between God and his believers who worship him in the church.
3. Advertisements
A major manifestation of conceptual metaphors are advertisements. Part of the selling power of an advertisement depends on how well chosen the conceptual metaphor is that the picture and the words used in the advertisement attempt to evoke in people. An appropriately selected metaphor may work wonders in promoting the sale of an item. For example, washing powders are frequently presented as good friends; this is based on the metaphor items to sell are people, which is a kind of personiﬁcation. a washing powder is a friend metaphor evokes in people the same attitudes and feelings that they have in connection with their good friends. Sexuality is also often relied on in advertisements. Cars are often shown as one’s lovers, and the people in the ads or commercials behave toward them as if they really were; they hug them, they kiss them, they whisper to them, and so on.
4. Symbols
Symbols in general and cultural symbols in particular may be based on wellentrenched metaphors in a culture. For instance, a common symbol of life is ﬁre. This symbol is a manifestation of the metaphor life is fire that also appears in mundane linguistic expressions such as to snuff out somebody’s life. To understand a symbol means in part to be able to see the conceptual metaphors that the symbol can evoke or was created to evoke. Consider, for example, the Statue of Liberty in New York City, as analyzed by Kövecses (1995d). The statue was created to evoke the idea that liberty was achieved in the United States (together with its “accompaniments”—knowledge and justice). This is displayed in the statue by means of several metaphors: metaphors for free action, history, and knowledge. Since action is self-propelled movement, free action will be uninhibited self-propelled movement. This arises from the fact that the statue steps forward as broken shackles lie at her feet. Moreover, a common view of history is that it is a change from a period of ignorance and oppression to a period of knowledge and freedom. This is based on the metaphor that historical change is movement from a state of ignorance to a state of knowledge. What evokes this metaphor is the fact that the statue steps forward with a torch enlightening the world. Finally, we have the metaphor knowing is seeing. Given these metaphors, the statue may be regarded as an embodiment of the metaphorical source domains: uninhibited movement, movement from dark to light, and seeing.
But today the statue simply evokes in most Americans the image of a benevolent and wealthy country (America) that readily helps and accepts people who are in need (the poor immigrants). How can this interpretation

66 METAPHOR
be given to it? The reason in part is that Americans (but also others) have the metaphor a state or a country is a person, plus some conventional knowledge about women. The statue represents a woman, who is beckoning to the immigrants arriving, and who is a “mighty” but gentle woman, who readily welcomes her children to her home. The poem engraved on the plaque at the entrance to the statue suggests this interpretation:
Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame, With conquering limbs astride from land to land; Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand A mighty woman with a torch, whose ﬂame Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles. From her beacon-hand Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame. “Keep ancient lands, your storied pomp!” cries she With silent lips. “Give me your tired, your poor, Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, The wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me, I lift my lamp beside the golden door!”
5. Myths
Conceptual metaphors may be realized in myths in a variety of ways. One of these is when a metaphor functions as a key element in a myth. We have seen examples of this in the myth of Oedipus, in which the metaphors a lifetime is a day and life is a journey serve as important elements in saving Oedipus’s life from the Sphinx.
Another way in which metaphors participate in myths involves the “characters” of myths themselves. For example, it has been suggested by Pamela Morgan (discussed in Lakoff, 1993) that Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea (and some other forceful things, like earthquakes, horses, and bulls), is really the god of uncontrollable external events in general. This is based on the observation that there exists a very general metaphor according to which uncontrollable external events are large, moving objects. Large, moving physical objects that exert a huge force on people include the sea. Poseidon can thus be seen as the god of uncontrollable external events in general, and not just god of the sea (or some other speciﬁc forceful entity).
6. Dream Interpretation
In Genesis, Pharaoh has a dream: he is standing on the riverbank when seven fat cows come out of the river, followed by seven lean cows that eat the

NONLINGUISTIC REALIZATIONS OF CONCEPTUAL METAPHORS 67
seven fat ones and still remain lean. Then Pharaoh dreams again: this time he sees seven “full and good” ears of corn growing and then seven withered ears growing after them. The withered ears devour the good ears. Pharaoh calls on Joseph to interpret the two dreams. Joseph interprets the two as one dream. The seven fat cows and full ears are good years, and the seven lean cows and withered ears are famine years that follow the good years. This interpretation turned out to be the correct one. How was Joseph able to interpret the dream? How did he know that it was about years and time? The reason is that he was aware of a metaphor that has been with us ever since biblical times: times are moving objects. We saw this metaphor in chapter 4. A special case of moving objects is a river. Indeed, rivers are commonly employed to understand time metaphorically. Another conceptual metaphor that’s needed for a fuller interpretation is achieving a purpose is eating. This explains why we have cows and ears of corn in the dream. These were typical foods eaten at the time. Finally, Joseph relied on the metaphor resources are food. By combining these conceptual metaphors, Joseph could arrive at the correct interpretation.
What this example shows is that much of the interpretation of dreams depends on everyday conceptual metaphors. In other words, dreams realize particular combinations of metaphors.
7. Interpretation of History
Metaphors also play some role in modern myths. We often use these myths to make sense of historical events. For example, Szilvia Csábi (1997) argues that much of the early history of America (the settlement by the English) was conceptualized in terms of some of the key events in the Bible, such as the movement of the Jewish people from Egypt to the Promised Land. This way of thinking about the settlement of America by the English Puritans was characteristic of the ordinary people who actually participated in the early settlement, as well as those who later commented on this and thus tried to come up with a coherent account of it (one example being the later American commentator, Margaret Fuller [1843]). This account is couched in metaphor, and in the cognitive linguistic view we can refer to it as the metaphor: the settlement of north america by the english settlers is the movement of the jews from egypt to the promised land.
But the actual makers or agents of history can also consciously pattern their actions on a particular source domain. This is what happened in the Mormons’ case, who, again, used the biblical account of the Jews’ ﬂight from Egypt into Israel as their source domain in a conscious way. They modeled their ﬂight west to what is now the Salt Lake City area on the Jews’ ﬂight to Israel. The Mormons referred to their new home as Zion, and they were inﬂuenced in their choice of homeland by the fact of a river (that they called Jordan), leading from a freshwater lake (Utah Lake = Sea of Galilee) to a salt-water dead sea (Great Salt Lake = Dead Sea). Brigham Young, the leader

68 METAPHOR
of the Mormons, is supposed to have sat up in his sickbed, when the caravan reached a point where he could see the valley, and said “This is the place.”
Conceptual metaphor analysis can also shed light on those areas of history that have been subject to much debate. An analysis of slave narratives and biographies written between 1789 and 1861 by Réka Benczes revealed that the slaves were acutely aware of white dominance, which some of the African Americans perceived as originating from the fact that slaves were kept in “beastlike stupor” (Douglass [1845] 1989, p. 1909). Similarly, the orientational metaphors that have been uncovered also point to the possibility that the slaves did not see their status as a natural one, for although they perceived themselves as being down, that is, existing on a lower level than slaveholders or white people, originally they existed on a “higher” level of existence from which they were degraded or reduced. The narratives also made use of a simpliﬁed, dualistic worldview of good and evil, where the slaves were regarded as good Christians thrust into slavery (that is, hell) by the wicked slaveholders. However, the freedom is a deity/god conceptual metaphor offered consolation, as it promised rectiﬁcation in the afterlife for the sufferings the slaves had to endure in the material world. As a ﬁnal illustration, consider the work of Alexis de Tocqueville, the French social thinker who attempted an interpretation of American democracy in the early decades of the nineteenth century. His book, Democracy in America, is still one of the most often referred to works on the subject. According to Kövecses (1994), Tocqueville analyzes American democracy metaphorically as a highly defective person, whose defects have to be made up for and counterbalanced by external forces such as the legal system. This view of democracy depends crucially on the acceptance of the conceptual metaphor a state is a person. Tocqueville’s argument is couched in terms of this metaphor throughout his work.
8. Politics and Foreign Policy
Politics in general is rife with conceptual metaphors. In American politics, for example, political thought (and discourse) is largely structured by the following metaphors: politics is war, politics is business, society is a family, society is a person, and the presidential election is a race. To take just one example, given the politics is war metaphor, American society can be seen as composed of armies that correspond to political groups, the leaders of the armies correspond to political leaders, the weapons used by the army are the ideas and policies of the political groups, the objective of the war is some political goal, and so on. These metaphors are widely disseminated in the media and by politicians themselves. Most important, they impose a particular order or pattern on political activities. They not only make sense of these activities but also structure them in imperceptible ways.
If a nation is conceived of as a person, then it is possible to think of neighboring countries as “neighbors,” who can be friendly or hostile, strong or weak, and healthy or sick. Strength corresponds here to military strength

NONLINGUISTIC REALIZATIONS OF CONCEPTUAL METAPHORS 69
and health to economic wealth. This metaphor has certain implications for foreign politics. A country can be identiﬁed as strong and another as weak. Since strength is associated with men and weakness with women, a militarily strong nation can be seen as “raping” a weak one when it attacks the weak nation. The case in point is the Gulf War of 1990, when Iraq attacked and occupied Kuwait. The attack was interpreted as the “rape” of Kuwait. This interpretation provided moral justiﬁcation for the United States to go to war against Iraq. Iraq was seen as a villain, Kuwait as a victim, and the United States as a hero that rescues an innocent victim. At the very least, casting the events in terms of a “fairy-tale scenario” helped the U.S. president to get support for an important decision; because of choosing the right metaphor, he managed to get his decision to go to war accepted by the American people.
9. Morality
Discourse about morality often involves two foundational conceptual metaphors: (1) morality is strength and (2) morality is nurturance. These metaphors can be laid out in greater detail as follows.
According to the ﬁrst metaphorical system of morality, evil can act on an “upright” person, who can either “fall” (become bad) or remain upright (remain good). The evil can be either an external or an internal force. External evil may be a dangerous situation that causes fear. Internal evil may be, for example, any of the seven deadly sins. In either case, a moral person would apply a counterforce in an effort to overcome the force of evil and would be successful in overcoming it. Thus, in this view, moral “strength” is based on the notion of physical strength:
(1) being good is being upright being bad is being low doing evil is falling evil is a force morality is strength
In the second metaphorical system, morality appears to be more of an “other-directed” issue than a “self-directed” issue:
(2) the community is a family moral agents are nurturing parents people needing help are children needing nurturance moral action is nurturance
In the “strength” metaphor there is only a single moral agent, whereas in the nurturance version there are two agents—people who need help and people who have a responsibility to provide that help. It is not the case that the two metaphors exclude each other in the actual practice of morality in everyday life. They are used together on most occasions, but different people

70 METAPHOR
may give different priorities to them. For some people, morality is primarily deﬁned in terms of the morality is strength metaphor, whereas for others it is deﬁned mostly in terms of morality is nurturance.
Interestingly, the different priorities given to the two metaphors may account for two conceptions of politics—conservatism and liberalism. If one considers the morality is strength metaphor as more important, this person is likely to be attracted to conservative ideals and ideas in politics. Alternatively, if someone considers the “nurturance” metaphor more important for morality, this person is more likely to be a liberal concerning political issues. How is this possible? The link between one’s moral and political views is provided by a metaphor of nation we have already mentioned above: a nation or society is a family. Society is conventionally viewed as a family with the state as a parent and citizens as children. The two views of morality brieﬂy outlined here imply different conceptions of a family. In the “moral strength” metaphor, the family consists of independent and self-reliant individuals, and morality is taught and learned primarily through discipline (to resist evil). In the “nurturance” metaphor, the family consists of people who have a moral obligation to help each other to begin with. In this family, morality is taught and learned less through discipline than through nurturance. Now the priorities given to the two metaphors will have implications for one’s political views because the two conceptions of family and morality will inﬂuence one’s view of the nation as a family. The metaphor-based notion of morality will have different consequences for one’s political views. Morality and politics will fuse into “moral politics.”
10. Social Institutions
Certain social institutions may also be based on conceptual metaphors. Consider the use of “grades” in school. In the United States, the letter grades A, B, C, D, and E or F are used, but these are merely disguised forms of numbers, either going from 1 to a higher number such as 5 or from 5 to 1. This common practice exists in many countries throughout the world. The metaphor that seems to underlie the social institution of “grading” is quality is quantity. According to this metaphor, matters of quality— such as knowledge, skills, understanding, and sensitivity—are comprehended through units of quantity such as numbers. In some cultures, the quantiﬁcation of qualitative things has reached huge proportions. For example, in the United States, achievements in sport are primarily interpreted through quantiﬁcation of some kind. This is especially common in baseball, where statistics of all kinds are used to “measure” achievements.
11. Social Practices
Some metaphors can create certain social practices. One of these is the seeing is touching metaphor. This is the metaphor at work when we say

NONLINGUISTIC REALIZATIONS OF CONCEPTUAL METAPHORS 71
things like “He couldn’t take his eyes off of her.” The same metaphor generates the social practices of “avoiding eye contact” with someone we do not know and “undressing someone with one’s eyes.” The prohibition against this is also based on seeing is touching. Both of these cases make a conceptual metaphor “real” in everyday social practice.
12. Literature
Literature is perhaps the most obvious area in which conceptual metaphors can be found. As noted in chapter 4, literature commonly makes use of unconventional(ized) metaphorical expressions that are based on conventional conceptual metaphors. In this sense, the creativity of literature is constrained by our everyday metaphorical conceptual system.
All the examples we discussed in chapter 4 were linguistically realized metaphors. However, literature also contains metaphors that are realized nonlinguistically. The most interesting cases of the nonlinguistic realization of conceptual metaphors in literature are those where an entire literary genre is based on a given metaphor. One of the subgenres of literature is biography. In biography it is common to conceptualize one’s life in terms of a story. What makes this a nonlinguistic metaphor is that it is the entire plot that is cast as if it were a story. When the telling of one’s life is presented as if it were a story, it gains its structure from the metaphor life is a story. Furthermore, fairytales and folktales frequently use this metaphor to present the lives of the characters participating in them. In short, the most common way of giving the history of one’s life is in terms of the life is a story metaphor.
Another subgenre within ﬁction seems to be structured by what we called the life is a journey metaphor. One example of this is The Pilgrim’s Progress. The two metaphors can also combine to yield a mixture of the two subgenres. When this is the case, the story of one’s life is based on the historical account of a journey. In all these cases, it is the actions and events of one’s life that are structured by a conceptual metaphor. Thus, it is the plot itself that manifests a certain conceptual metaphor, as this becomes especially clear when a novel or short story is turned into a ﬁlm.
13. Gestures and Multimodal Metaphors
The idea that a large part of human thinking is rooted in metaphor has over the past ﬁfteen years resulted in a rapidly growing literature on nonverbal and multimodal manifestations of metaphor. (The survey discussed in this section is based on Charles Forceville and Alan Cienki’s assessment of the ﬁeld; Forceville and Cienki, personal communication, September 2008.) The basic idea in this young ﬁeld within metaphor studies is that neither a metaphor’s target nor its source have to be necessarily rendered verbally. Indeed, if metaphor is primarily a matter of thought and action, this is exactly what

72 METAPHOR
one would expect. Other modes (or, modalities) besides speaking or writing that a metaphor can be manifested in are pictures, sound, music, and gesture, and perhaps even smell, touch, and taste, allowing for a distinction between monomodal and multimodal metaphors. In the former, both target and source are conveyed in the same mode (for instance, language or pictures); in the latter, they are conveyed entirely or predominantly in different modes (for instance, the target by a photograph and the source by a verbal caption or the target in spoken words and the source by a gesture). But in many multimodal metaphors, target or source, or both, may be expressed in more than one mode simultaneously.
Two major lines in conceptual metaphor theory (CMT) research pertaining to multimodal metaphor can be distinguished. The ﬁrst comes from gesture studies. Several researchers consider gesture to be an aspect of the act of utterance (not as something distinct from verbal communication), and even as an integral part of language itself (McNeill 1992, 2005). Gestures that reﬂect the transfer of concepts from one domain to another were “rediscovered” by David McNeill in the early 1990s.
Indeed, many metaphoric gestures involve the representation of ideas mentioned verbally as if they were objects, as shown by Eve Sweetser (1998). But the fact that the target may often be named verbally and the source depicted gesturally (as with the example of abstract idea as concrete object) does not mean that gesture is always, or even usually, redundant with the accompanying words. Indeed, gesture can reveal aspects of meaning that are not, or even cannot, be present in the words alone. Cienki (1998) observes that a speaker of English may talk about a sequence of events in time and gesture manually with a movement from left to right, and yet while the gesture correlates with the notion that past is left and future is right, past and future are not talked about in English with spatial metaphors of left and right (see chapter 3). Gesture can thus provide evidence of imagistic manners of metaphoric thinking—in this case perhaps based on the convention of the time line—which we would not ﬁnd from verbal data alone. In addition, the fact that gesture often precedes the onset of speech in a way that the speaker is not aware of, as McNeill (1992) and others point out, may be seen as lending support to the CMT view that metaphoric thinking is largely automatic and below the level of conscious awareness. A recent look at metaphor and gestures, moreover, emphasizes the dynamic nature of metaphor, as Cornelia Müller’s work indicates (Müller, in press); this is an aspect of metaphor that tends to be underestimated due to the staticness of the paradigmatic A IS B formula.
The second line of research in multimodal metaphor concentrates on its occurrence in moving and static images. Forceville developed a model for the analysis of pictorial (also called visual) metaphors in print and billboard advertising (Forceville 1994, 1996; Phillips, 2003). Other genres that have attracted the attention of pictorial and multimodal metaphor scholars are political cartoons (El Refaie, 2003) and art (Forceville 1988; Rothenberg 2008). When accounting for metaphors in moving images, adaptations of

NONLINGUISTIC REALIZATIONS OF CONCEPTUAL METAPHORS 73
Forceville’s model entailed a shift of focus from pictorial to multimodal metaphors, since post-silent ﬁlm can draw at the least on the pictorial, verbal, sonic, and musical modes for the presentation of target and source themselves, as well as for the cueing of source-to-target mappings. Multimodal metaphors in commercials are discussed by Forceville (2007a, 2007b), Amy Wiggin and Christine Miller (2003), and NingYu (in press), and in videoclips by Kathrin Fahlenbrach (2005).
While until recently theorizing in this young subdiscipline of metaphor studies had been mainly concerned with what Max Black (1979) called creative metaphor, that is, with ad hoc connections between target and source, currently attempts are made to examine if, and if so how, multimodal discourses can exemplify structural metaphors. Kövecses’s (1986, 2000a) work has inspired research on the pictorial representation of emotions in comics (Eerden, in press; Forceville, 2005b; Shinohara and Matsunaka, in press), whereas the source-path-goal schema underlying metaphors such as life is a journey and a story is a journey (Johnson, 1993; Lakoff, 1993) invites systematic examination of various types of “road movies” (Forceville, 2006b, 2008 a; Forceville and Jeulink, 2007) and of the role of space in ﬁlms more generally (Fahlenbrach, 2007). The awareness that accultured elements complement embodied ones in verbal metaphors (Forceville et al, 2006; Gibbs and Steen, 1999; Kövecses, 2005; Maalej, 2001) will undoubtedly strongly inﬂuence work on multimodal metaphor as well (see various contributions in Forceville and Urios-Aparisi, in press). Forceville (2008 b) provides a comprehensive summary of work on multimodal metaphor.
Multimodal metaphor scholars are now beginning to explore other tropes (Forceville, in press; Teng, 2006; Teng and Sun, 2002; see also Kennedy, 1982), and the experimental testing of multimodal metaphors has also started.
SUMMARY
In addition to conceptual metaphors being expressed linguistically, they can also be realized in many other ways. These nonlinguistic ways include movies and acting, cartoons, drawings, sculptures, buildings, advertisements, myths, dream interpretation, the interpretation of history, cultural symbols, politics and foreign policy, morality, “moral politics,” social institutions, social practices, the nonlinguistic structure of certain literary genres, and many others that have not been discussed here. One such case is where metaphors are realized in gestures. There is a growing body of research into metaphorical aspects of gestures.
In light of these cases, we can conclude that conceptual metaphor pervades much of our social, artistic, psychological, intellectual, and cultural lives. Metaphor is present not only in the way we speak but also in much of our nonlinguistic reality. This insight makes the cognitive linguistic view of metaphor especially valuable to nonlinguists as well. At the same time, sensitivity to metaphor in language may help us discover conceptual metaphors in many nonlinguistic areas of human experience.

A listing, together with a brief discussion, of the realization of conceptual metaphors in nonlinguistic areas is given in Lakoff (1993) and Gibbs (1994). Schön (1979) is an early analysis that shows how metaphors can be real. A highly relevant work in the same spirit is Shore (1996), in which he shows some of the major organizing metaphors of American culture. P. Morgan’s work is discussed in Lakoff (1993). Csábi (1997) analyzes the metaphors that structure the early American Puritan experience. Kövecses (1994) looks at the ways Tocqueville’s understanding of American democracy is inﬂuenced by certain conceptual metaphors. Benczes (2008) is a study of North American slave narratives. Kövecses (1995d) employs the machinery of cognitive linguistics to “decode” the Statue of Liberty. Lakoff (1992) presents a metaphor analysis of the Gulf War. Adamson et al. (1996) examine the metaphors underlying much of American politics. American foreign policy is described in terms of metaphors by Chilton and Lakoff (1995). Lakoff (1996) shows how the notions and practice of morality and politics are intertwined and how both are structured by metaphor. Forceville (1996) and Ungerer (2000) study how metaphors are made use of in advertisements. Their work shows that the study of “pictorial metaphors” is complex, raises several important theoretical questions, and thus deserves more attention by cognitive linguists. McNeill (1992) and Cienki (1998) have studied metaphorical gestures. Wilcox (2000) describes conceptual metaphors in American Sign Language. Lakoff analyzes political thought by making use of metaphorical frames in a number of recent publications (Lakoff, 2004, 2006, 2008b).
For overviews of the state of the art on metaphor and gesture and the multimodality of spoken communication, see Cienki and Müller (2008) and Müller and Cienki (in press). Whittock (1990) deserves credit for a ﬁrst systematic attempt to describe and categorize different types of cinematographic metaphor (see also Carroll [1994, 1996]; Forceville [1999, 2005a]). The experimental testing of pictorial and multimodal metaphors of various types was done by Shen and Gadir (in press), Van Mulken et al. (2008), and Kennedy (1993).

(i) America has “lost control” of its borders but remains deeply divided over how to curb the inexorable ﬂood of illegal immigration.
(ii) The United States is receiving the largest wave of immigration in its history.
(iii) This inﬂux strains our facilities for assimilation. (iv) But America is poorly equipped with the rising tide of people seeking to
come to the United States. (v) Here was another Asiatic reservoir of over 300 million souls threatening
to deluge the coast.
(a) How is the immigration process viewed in these sentences, i.e., what is the conceptual metaphor?
(b) Is this a positive or a negative view? Why?

The Basis of
Metaphor
Our conceptual system contains thousands of concrete and thousands of abstract concepts. We noted, furthermore, that in the cognitive linguistic view metaphors are sets of mappings between a more concrete or physical source domain and a more abstract target domain. This situation raises the issue whether any concrete concept can serve as a source domain for any target concept. In other words, can we make use of any concrete concept in the process of understanding any abstract one?
The same issue arises in the most widely shared traditional view of metaphor, except that here the question is not why one concept rather than another is selected as a metaphorical source domain, but why one linguistic expression rather than another is chosen to speak metaphorically about something. The answer in this view is that there is a similarity between the two entities denoted by the two linguistic expressions, and hence, between the meanings of the two expressions. Thus, the constraint that limits the excessive production of metaphor is that there must be a similarity between the two entities compared. If the two entities are not similar in some respect, we cannot metaphorically use one to talk about the other.
The issue of whether there are constraints on the production of metaphors is closely related to another one: the issue of the predictability of metaphors. Can we predict what the metaphors are in a particular language and across languages? The notion of “predictability” characterizes formal theories of language (e.g., generative grammar) that (try to) model themselves on the “exact” sciences such as physics. In this view, which metaphors we have should be predictable, and if our theory can’t predict them, the theory can be claimed to be unscientiﬁc.
Cognitive linguistics does not accept this view of what a theory should be capable of doing. In the description of metaphor in particular and of language in general, it breaks away from the notion of predictability and replaces this notion with motivation. As we will see at the end of the chapter
77

78 METAPHOR
and especially in chapter 13, the issue of which metaphors we have is not a matter of prediction but that of motivation; metaphors cannot be predicted, but they can be motivated.
Perhaps the most exciting new development in conceptual metaphor theory is what is called the neural theory of metaphor. In the last section of the present chapter, I will offer an outline of this theory.
1. The Similarity Constraint in the Traditional View
As discussed, in the traditional view similarity is the basis of metaphor, and it also constrains the selection of particular linguistic expressions to talk about something else. A fairly typical example of this would be the expression “the roses on her cheeks.” The example displays some typical features of the most widely held traditional view of metaphor:
(1) Metaphor is decorative or fancy speech. We use the word roses to talk about somebody’s cheeks because we wish to create some special effect in the listener or reader (such as creating a pleasing image). We do not use the word roses as part of the process of conceptualizing and understanding one thing in terms of another.
(2) Metaphor is a linguistic, and not a conceptual, phenomenon. Whatever the intended effect or purpose is, in metaphor we simply use one word or expression instead of another word or expression, rather than one conceptual domain to comprehend another.
(3) The basis for using the word roses to talk about somebody’s cheeks is the similarity between the color of some roses (pink or red) and that of the color of a person’s cheeks (also pink or some light red). This similarity makes it possible for speakers to use the word rose instead of, say, the phrase the pink skin on her cheeks for some special effect. The similarity between some roses and some kinds of skin exists in reality before anyone uses roses to talk about somebody’s cheeks.
(4) It is this preexisting kind of similarity between two things that constrains the possible metaphors speakers can employ for skins of some color. Given the color of this kind of skin on the cheeks, the rose is a good choice for a metaphor in a way in which many other things would not be; thus, for example, we could not talk metaphorically appropriately about the pinkish color on a person’s cheeks by using the word sky, as in “the sky on her cheeks.” The sky as we normally think of it (we take it to be blue) simply bears no resemblance to healthy pinkish skin on the cheeks. It is in this sense that in the traditional view certain preexisting similarities can determine or limit which linguistic expressions, rather than others, can be used to describe the world.
There is no doubt that this account of what linguistic expression can be used metaphorically in place of others applies to many cases. Preexisting similarity explains the selection of many metaphorical expressions in both conventional

THE BASIS OF METAPHOR 79
and unconventional language use. Nevertheless, there are additional cases where the account fails. We have seen many examples so far where it would be impossible to account for the use of a metaphorical expression with the notion of preexisting similarity. What could possibly be the preexisting similarity between, say, “digesting food” and “digesting ideas,” or between “We’re not going anywhere,” taken literally, and “This relationship is not going anywhere,” taken metaphorically. Similarly, what possible preexisting similarity exists between the concept of a journey and that of love?
For this reason, the cognitive linguistic view ﬁnds it important to provide an account of the selection of metaphorical source concepts (and their corresponding metaphorical linguistic expressions) that can also explain those cases where no obvious preexisting similarity between two entities can be found. This is the task to which we now turn.
2. The Grounding of Metaphors in the Cognitive Linguistic View
Can anything be a source domain for a particular target? If similarity cannot be taken to be a completely general account of the basis of metaphor, then what can? Or, to put the same question differently, what limits the selection of particular source domains for particular targets? For example, there is a large number of source domains for the target concept of love (roughly between twenty and thirty), but it is still a limited number. Not anything can function as a source concept for love. Quite simply, then, the question is why we have the sources that we do.
The cognitive linguistic view maintains that—in addition to objective, preexisting similarity—conceptual metaphors are based on a variety of human experience, including correlations in experience, various kinds of nonobjective similarity, biological and cultural roots shared by the two concepts, and possibly others. All of these may provide sufﬁcient motivation for the selection of source b1 over b2 or b3 for the comprehension of target a. Given such motivation, it makes sense to speakers of a language to use b1, rather than, say, b2 or b3, to comprehend a. They consequently feel that the conceptual metaphors that they use are somehow natural.
Let us now see the major ways in which conceptual metaphors are grounded in experience, either perceptual, biological, or cultural. This kind of groundedness for conceptual metaphors is often referred to as the experiential basis or motivation of a metaphor.
2.1. Correlations in Experience
Some metaphors are grounded in correlations in our experience. It is important to see that correlations are not similarities. If event E1 is accompanied by event E2 (either all the time or just habitually), E1 and E2 will not be similar events; they will be events that are correlated in experience. For example,
