7 Abstract
8 This paper aims to evidence the inherently metonymic nature of co-speech gestures. Arguing that motivation 9 in gesture involves iconicity (similarity), indexicality (contiguity), and habit (conventionality) to varying 10 degrees, it demonstrates how a set of metonymic principles may lend a certain systematicity to experientially 11 grounded processes of gestural abstraction and enaction. Introducing visuo-kinetic signs as an umbrella term 12 for co-speech gestures and signed languages, the paper shows how a frame-based approach to gesture may 13 integrate different cognitive/functional linguistic and semiotic accounts of metonymy (e.g., experiential 14 domains, frame metonymy, contiguity, and pragmatic inferencing). The guiding assumption is that gestures 15 metonymically profile deeply embodied, routinized aspects of familiar scenes, that is, the motivating context 16 of frames. The discussion shows how gestures may evoke frame structures exhibiting varying degrees of 17 groundedness, complexity, and schematicity: basic physical action and object frames; more complex frames; 18 and highly abstract, complex frame structures. It thereby provides gestural evidence for the idea that 19 metonymy is more basic and more directly experientially grounded than metaphor and thus often feeds into 20 correlated metaphoric processes. Furthermore, the paper offers some initial insights into how metonymy also 21 seems to induce the emergence of schematic patterns in gesture which may result from action-based and 22 discourse-driven processes of habituation and conventionalization. It exemplifies how these forces may 23 engender grammaticalization of a basic physical action into a gestural marker that shows strong metonymic 24 form reduction, decreased transitivity, and interacting pragmatic functions. Finally, addressing basic 25 metonymic operations in signed lexemes elucidates certain similarities regarding sign constitution in gesture 26 and sign. English and German multimodal discourse data as well as German Sign Language (DGS) are drawn 27 upon to illustrate the theoretical points of the paper. Overall, this paper presents a unified account of 28 metonymy’s role in underpinning forms, functions, and patterns in visuo-kinetic signs.

30 1 Introduction
31 Gestures are essentially metonymic: Iconic gestural figurations and enactments, in particular, exhibit 32 the principle of partial semiotic portrayal par excellence. In interaction with concurrent speech, 33 evanescent hand shapes and movements tend to abstract salient characteristics from, briefly allude to, 34 or otherwise evoke entire persons, three-dimensional objects, holistic motion events, and rich 35 contexts (e.g., Bouvet 2001; Calbris 2011; Gibbs 1994; Mittelberg 2006; Müller 1998). With their 36 gestures and postures, speakers typically foreground the particular aspects of previously witnessed or

Visuo-kinetic signs are inherently metonymic

37 newly imagined objects, actions, behaviors, or scenarios that are especially relevant to their

38 communicative intentions in ongoing discourses. They may trace, for instance, the spatial proportions

39 of a building in the air or imitate a person’s action, such as running to catch a bus or handing a

40 present to someone, in a reduced or stylized fashion. Interlocutors may thus, consciously or not,

41 convey essential facets and kinesthetic qualities of their embodied experiences, memories, habits,

42 mental imagery, or the immediate environment by schematically but effectively making them

43 tangible and thus intersubjectively sharable in the here and now of a given multimodally orchestrated

44 speech event (e.g., Mittelberg 2013; Müller 2014, 2017; Sweetser 2007).

46

For example, if I am telling a friend that I will be spending the entire weekend working on my

47 paper and simultaneously make a fleeting typing action, my hands simulate typing on an imaginary

48 keyboard. From such a quick iconic gestural action, the addressee may infer that I will, in fact, be

49 carefully and concentratedly typing for hours on the keyboard that actually exists on my desk. She

50 can also infer the fact that, in this context, “working” means writing with the help of a computer.

51 Moreover, she can imagine the written text that will result from this action, the content of the paper

52 she knows I am working on, as well as other practically and ideationally related actions, entities,

53 stages, versions, and mental or emotional states involved in eventually reaching the goal of

54 submitting the finalized manuscript. All these various aspects are metonymically linked in a

55 pragmatically structured context of experience, or frame (Fillmore 1982), in which one gesture may

56 evoke not only the immediately contiguous virtual keyboard, but also trigger an ensuing associative

57 chain and a larger semantic network (e.g., Calbris 2011; Mittelberg 2017a; Mittelberg and Waugh

58 2014).

59

60 1.1 Metonymic motivation of gestural abstraction and enaction: More than iconicity

61

62 The primary aim of this paper is to pinpoint the inherently metonymic nature of co-speech gestures.

63 It will show how distinct metonymic principles may lend a certain experientially-grounded

64 systematicity to processes of ad hoc abstraction and enaction that are involved in gestural sign

65 formation (e.g., Arnheim 1969; Müller 1998). Gestural abstraction and the resulting schematicity

66 here are assumed not to be random, but experientially, cognitively, linguistically, pragmatically, and

67 culturally motivated. Due to the temporal dynamics of face-to-face communication, there is only a

68 very limited amount of time to perform gestures in sync with the conceptual contents, incremental

69 articulation, and prosodic contours of the simultaneously evolving utterance as well as with other

70 bodily signs such as gaze and head movements.

71

72

Crucially, visual perception, often somewhat privileged in cognitive approaches to language, is

73 only one sensory, experiential source from which gesturers intuitively draw their semiotic material. A

74 point the present proposal wishes to make is that motivation in gesture involves more than iconicity 75 (e.g., McNeill 1992; Mittelberg 2006, 2014; Perniss et al. 2010).1 It is claimed that in gesture, besides

76 interacting with iconicity and metaphoricity, it is through indexicality that metonymy also operates 77 on latent contiguity relations between the hands and the material and social world.2 Such contiguity

1 According to Peirce (1960: 157), “icons have qualities which resemble those of the objects they represent, and they excite analogous sensations in the mind.” The term ‘Object’ here encompasses existing and imagined entities, persons, actions, etc. For both the gesturer and the interpreter, gestural icons thus rely on a perceived similarity between the gestural from and what they are signify. 2 In indexical signs, the relation between sign and object is based on contiguity, according to Peirce, that is, on a factual (physical or causal) connection between a gestural form and what it evokes: “An index is a sign that denotes its object by virtue of being really affected by that object” (Peirce 1960: 143). See also Table 1.

Visuo-kinetic signs are inherently metonymic

78 relations may become operationalized for gestural communication and thus lead the interpreting mind 79 to ‘grasp’ the virtual objects and tools that gesturing hands seemingly manipulate (e.g., Mittelberg 80 and Waugh 2014; Müller 1998; Streeck 2009). By laying out how gestures may metonymically 81 evoke frames through picking out aspects of basic scenes of experience (Fillmore 1977, 1982; 82 Goldberg 1995, 1998), it will further be argued that a frame-based approach to gesture may not only 83 integrate various accounts of metonymy (e.g., Dancygier and Sweetser 2014), but also account for 84 processes of pragmatic inferencing that are often heavily involved in gesture interpretation.
85

86

While the paper focuses on spontaneous gestures that are temporally, semantically, and

87 syntactically integrated with concurrent speech (e.g., Fricke 2012; Kendon 2004; McNeill 1992;

88 Müller 1998), metonymic modes underpinning iconic signs in sign language will also be addressed to

89 highlight some commonalities regarding principles of sign constitution. Furthermore, the paper offers

90 some initial insights into how embodied metonymic principles also seem to underpin discourse-

91 pragmatic processes of routinization and schematization in gesture; that is, how metonymy may

92 induce the emergence of gestural patterns with increased degrees of habit-driven conventionalization

93 (e.g., Mittelberg 2006, 2017a/b; Müller 2017). Overall, this paper presents the first unified account of

94 metonymy’s role in underpinning forms, functions, and patterns in visuo-kinetic signs.

95

96 1.2 Gestures as visuo-kinetic signs in multimodal contextures of communicative action 97

98 Co-speech gestures here are understood as discourse-embedded, kinetic action that is performed with 99 the head, hands, arms, torso, or entire body and has some communicative function(s) (e.g., Calbris 100 2011; Kendon 2004; Müller 1998). Partly in reference to Jakobson’s (1972/1987: 474) notion of 101 “motor signs,” the term visuo-kinetic signs is introduced here to encapsulate the fact that gestures are 102 part of, or emerge from, the human body with its inherent morphology, motion range, motor routines, 103 and multiple senses with which we perceive and understand the world around us. Gestures genuinely 104 preserve and (re-)enact some of their kinetic, sensorimotor, tactile, and interpersonal origins (e.g., 105 Mittelberg 2010, 2018; Müller 2017). While gestures usually need concurrent speech to specify their 106 local meaning, they often do something in their own right and in their own specific, experientially 107 motivated ways (e.g., Mittelberg and Joue 2017; Müller 2017; Wehling 2017).

108

109

While gestures are part of the visual – and thus visible and observable – facets that make up

110 contextualized language use in interaction, the Kendonian (2004) idea of visual action as utterance

111 duly emphasizes the fact that gestures are more than just visual. Gestures are communicative bodily

112 actions that are instantaneously performed by human beings and dynamically evolve in time and

113 space (e.g., Goodwin 2011; Müller 1998; Streeck et al. 2011; Sweetser 2007). One important factor

114 in gesture interpretation and analysis, however, resides in the fact that the ‘semiotic material’ we are

115 looking at consists not only of observable physical components – such as body posture, body motion,

116 finger configurations, as well as the position and movements of gesturing hands – but also of

117 immaterial, yet signifying, components such as evanescent movement traces created in the air or

118 imaginary surfaces, objects, or points in space (e.g. Hassemer 2015; Mittelberg 2010). Speakers’

Visuo-kinetic signs are inherently metonymic

119 hands often pretend to hold or otherwise manipulate virtual objects and/or tools – the typing gesture 120 necessarily implies an imagined keyboard – or to interact with imaginary interlocutors. 121 Consequently, to do justice to the noted specific semiotic nature of gestures, the present account of 122 gestures as visuo-kinetic signs also includes elements and dimensions of multimodally achieved sign 123 processes that are not visual, and hence rather invisible, but still contribute to a gesture’s kinesthetic 124 feel, meaning, and pragmatic function(s) (e.g., Mittelberg 2006, 2013). As will be shown below, 125 metonymy enables us to account for the virtual elements thus implied, or created on-the-fly, which 126 may be inferred from their dynamically evolving multimodal semiotic contextures (Jakobson 1956; 127 see also Goodwin 2011; Müller 1998; Streeck 2009). By illuminating the pragmatic workings of 128 metonymy in visuo-kinetic signs, this paper seeks to provide additional insights into the nature of 129 both gesture and metonymy.

130

131 2 Towards a frame-based account of embodied metonymy in gesture 132

133 Metonymy belongs – together with metaphor, synecdoche, and irony – to the four master tropes

134 (Burke 1941). Jakobson (1956) was one of the first to advocate a balanced theory of metaphor and

135 metonymy as two universal principles of association and signification that are prominent in language,

136 thought, discourse, literature, and the visual arts (e.g., Waugh and Monville-Burston 1990).

137 Subsequently, experientialist views on language and the embodied mind attributed a preeminent role

138 to metaphor (e.g., Johnson 1987; Lakoff and Johnson 1980; Lakoff 1987; Sweetser 1990). The

139 ground-laying idea was that the human conceptual system, language, language change, and language

140 use, encompassing all types of discourse, are structured and function metaphorically to an extent that

141 had previously been underestimated.

142

143

With little delay, metonymy has become recognized as an equally important figure of thought and

144 language (e.g., Barcelona 2000a/b, 2003; Dirven and Pörings 2002; Fauconnier and Turner 2002;

145 Gibbs 1994, 1999; Panther and Thornburg 2003; Panther and Radden 1999). In recent years, cross-

146 linguistic research has clearly confirmed that metonymy plays a constitutive role in conceptual,

147 semantic, and grammatical structuring, as well as in discourse processes, including, for example,

148 indirect reference, speech acts, and pragmatic inferencing (e.g., Barcelona 2009; Benczes et al. 2011;

149 Kövecses 2013; Littlemore 2015; Panther et al. 2009). A crucial tenet of the present proposal on how

150 gesturally engendered sign processes involve ‘metonymy in the making’ is that “metonymy is a

151 central organizing principle of pragmatics, the contextual use and interpretation of meaning”

152 (Dancygier and Sweetser 2014: 162; see also contributions in Hampe 2017).

153

154

Furthermore, there is a growing body of work on metonymy in various modalities, media, and

155 art forms, ranging from mnemonic devices, painting, material culture to advertisement and film

156 (e.g., Forceville 2007; Forceville and Urios-Aparisi 2009; Jakobson and Pomorska 1983;

157 Littlemore 2015; Mittelberg 2002, 2006). Regardless of the modality or medium in which

158 metonymy materializes, it may create single meaningful sparks in our minds or set into motion

159 complex associative chains and networks (e.g., Benczes et al. 2011). Metonymy thus may propel

160 diverse processes of reasoning, imagination, and discourse construction (e.g., Coulson 2001;

161 Dancygier and Sweetser 2014; Fauconnier and Turner 2002), both within one modality and across

162 modalities.

163

164 Due to limits of space, this paper cannot provide a comprehensive overview of all the different kinds,

Visuo-kinetic signs are inherently metonymic

165 functions, and manifestations of metonymy described in the literature. Rather, I will draw on the 166 approaches to metonymy that seem particularly apt to account for the structuring and meaning167 making processes at work in bodily signs that partake in multimodal interaction. I will thus try to 168 show why, in the case of manual gestures and other visuo-kinetic signs, it makes sense to shift the 169 focus from strongly cognitively oriented accounts to truly embodied, or body-based, understandings 170 of metonymy. To this effect, the exposition below will provide further gestural evidence for the claim 171 that metonymy is more directly experientially motivated than metaphoric processes with which they 172 tend to interact (building on Mittelberg 2006, 2013, 2017a; Mittelberg and Waugh 2009, 2014; see 173 also, e.g., Barcelona 2000a; Dancygier and Sweetser 2014; Kövecses 2013; Ruiz de Mendoza Ibanez 174 2017).3 Advocating a frame-based account of metonymy in gesture, the ensuing sections aim to show 175 how various metonymic principles function as fundamental construal mechanisms that drive 176 pragmatically grounded processes of embodied schematization in co-speech gestures.

177 178 2.1 Experiential and functional domains
179

180 According to domain-based accounts, metonymic mappings occur within the same cognitive or

181 experiential domain, or within the same idealized cognitive model (i.e., ICM, Lakoff 1987; Panther

182 and Radden 1999: 19ff.). Barcelona (2003: 83) provides the following definition with a functional

183 emphasis: “(a) metonymy is a mapping of a cognitive domain, the source, onto another domain, the

184 target. Target and source are in the same functional domain and are linked by a pragmatic function,

185 so that the target is mentally activated.” Let us consider the by now classic example of a metonymic

186 linguistic expression given in (1) (Lakoff and Johnson 1980: 35; see also Dancygier and Sweestser

187 2014: 5):

188

189

(1) The ham sandwich is waiting for his check.

190

191

(2) Table 5 urgently needs to pay.

192 193 Here, “the ham sandwich” does not refer to a food item but, indirectly, to the restaurant client who 194 ordered it. The dish previously served by a member of the service personnel, and probably already 195 consumed by the client, thus stands for the latter, based on contextual, pragmatic links binding these 196 elements within one and the same functional domain (e.g., Fauconnier and Turner 2002). Another 197 common way to refer to restaurant clients is by the number of the table they are sitting at, such as in 198 (2). Here, a different element in this particular experiential domain or pragmatic context is 199 highlighted, namely the table as a physical location inside the restaurant. In both expressions, the 200 client is the metonymic target domain. The kind of domain that is chosen to be the metonymic source 201 domain depends on the pragmatic forces and customs at work in a particular context of use. The 202 factors that determine the choice of source domain in (1) and (2) include the interpersonally built-up 203 common ground and the professional practices of the service personnel, who are used to 204 communicating about this kind of frequently occurring situation.

3 The line of research on which this paper builds (Mittelberg 2006, 2008, 2013, 2014, 2017a; Mittelberg and Waugh 2009, 2014) combines traditional semiotic frameworks that are not exclusively based on language – notably the works of Peirce (1960) and Jakobson (1956, 1972) – with embodied approaches to language, cognition, and interaction (e.g., Dancygier and Sweetser 2014; Fillmore 1982; Gibbs 2006; Goldberg 1995; Johnson 1987; Lakoff 1987). While the previous work focused on semantic and pragmatic functions of metonymy in gesture, this paper is the first account that integrates related aspects of embodied grammaticalization, constructions, and lexemes in signed languages.

Visuo-kinetic signs are inherently metonymic

205

206

As is well known, metaphor, by contrast, involves a mapping between two different experiential

207 domains, as expressed by, for instance, the conceptual metaphor UNDERSTANDING IS

208 GRASPING (e.g., Lakoff and Johnson 1980). This cross-domain mapping gives rise to metaphoric

209 linguistic expressions, such as in (3), where the abstract target domain of understanding is

210 conceptualized in terms of the physical source domain of manually seizing an object. Alternatively,

211 the same target domain may be structured by another bodily source domain, that is, visual perception

212 as a way of comprehending something (UNDERSTANDING IS SEEING, ibid.), such as in (4).

217

218

In gesture, body-centered and action-based source domains may intuitively activate pragmatic

219 links to metonymic targets with which they are connected through repeated instances of similar

220 physical experience (e.g., Mittelberg and Joue 2017). Certain manual actions may evoke the objects

221 or tools that are routinely handled when they are actually performed. For instance, to ask for more

222 bread in a restaurant, one may first raise a hand to catch the waiter’s attention and then point with

223 that hand at the empty bread basket one is holding up with the other hand. The waiter will readily

224 understand this gestural request based on the gesture and the empty bread basket, which here

225 functions as the source domain pointing to the desired target: additional bread. Put differently, the

226 CONTAINER stands metonymically for the wanted CONTENT; arriving at the latter involves following a

227 contextually shaped, inferential pathway (e.g., Barcelona 2003, 2009; Panther and Thornburg 2003).

228 Bread basket and bread belong to the same mundane experiential domain not only in people’s homes,

229 but also in a restaurant context, where it is common practice to serve bread in baskets and also to

230 provide refills.

231

232

If one performs this gestural request without concurrent speech, the basket metonymically evokes

233 the idea of bread on visual and experiential grounds. However, it is likely that the person wanting

234 more bread actually also verbally asks the waiter for it, as in (5) or (6), once the latter has arrived at

235 the table. In both linguistic examples, there is no mention of the basket, only of the (non-existent)

236 bread. Furthermore, (6) functions as an indirect speech act, that is, an assertion indirectly functions as

237 a request in this case. Qualifying as a speech act metonymy, it may be understood “as a scenario

238 having metonymic structure” (Panther and Thornburg 2003: 128).

239

240

(5) Could we have more bread please?

241

242

(6) We are out of bread.

243

244

Building on Langacker (1987), Croft (1993) extended the single-domain approach to a domain

245 matrix, which involves shifts in foregrounding from one domain to another domain in the same

246 matrix. Applying this idea to the bread-request scenario, we can assume that first the empty basket is

247 foregrounded due to its perceptional prominence with respect to the bread that formerly existed in it;

6

Visuo-kinetic signs are inherently metonymic

248 then, the metonymic process causes a shift in foregrounding onto the metonymic target, that is, the 249 indirectly referenced bread that the client would like the waiter to fetch.
250

251

When it comes to gesture and multimodal interaction, the focus is naturally on the communicating

252 human body and thus especially on those experiential domains that are indexically anchored in the

253 material and social contexts of people engaged in some sort of physical action or in communicative

254 exchange (Mittelberg 2017a). For example, a participant in a study on transitive action gestures

255 (Grandhi et al. 2011) gives the following verbal instruction regarding how to slice an apple into

256 pieces:

257

258

(7) You need to slice the apple by holding it down and cutting it there.

259

260 Here no actual (i.e., visible) physical object is involved in the gestural portrayal. Pretending to be 261 holding a virtual knife in her dominant right hand, she pantomimes how she would cut a virtual apple 262 that she is seemingly holding down with her left hand (Figure 1, adapted from Grandhi et al. 2011).
263

264 PLEASE INSERT FIGURE 1 ABOUT HERE 265

266 Indeed, slicing an apple into pieces necessitates a particular action (cutting), an object (apple), and a 267 tool (knife). All three elements thus belong to the same experiential domain or scenario. Whereas 268 what the participant says in (7) draws attention to the cutting action and the object, but not to the tool, 269 the latter can be easily inferred from the action context. Again, the actions and objects implied belong 270 to an everyday domain of experience. Moreover, this example involves a CAUSE-EFFECT 271 metonymy, for we can imagine the apple first in its entirety and then the slices resulting from the 272 cutting action (as shown in Figure 1; see also Mittelberg and Waugh 2014).
273

274 2.2 Semantic frames and familiar scenes of experience 275

276 A large part of what has been described above based on cognitive, experiential, or functional domains 277 can also be understood in frame-semantic terms (see also, e.g., Dancygier and Sweetser 2014; 278 Kövecses 2013; Panther and Radden 1999: 9). According to Fillmore (1982: 111), the term frame 279 covers “any system of concepts related in such a way that to understand any of them you have to 280 understand the whole structure in which it fits.” Frames can thus be understood as metonymically 281 structured wholes in which one of its parts may evoke another correlated part or the frame as a whole 282 (e.g., Mittelberg and Joue 2017).
283

284

While the semantic structures in question are situated at relatively high levels of abstractness,

285 Fillmore (1975: 127) emphasizes how frames are experientially grounded in familiar scenes which

286 underpin the acquisition of word meanings and the gradual differentiation of whole scenarios into

7

Visuo-kinetic signs are inherently metonymic

287 their constitutive parts. Scenes “include not only visual scenes but familiar kinds of interpersonal 288 transactions, standard scenarios, familiar layouts, institutional structures, enactive experiences, body 289 image; and, in general, any kind of coherent segment, large or small, of human beliefs, actions, 290 experiences, or imaginings” (Fillmore 1977: 63). Since human behavior and gestures are intrinsic to 291 such scenes and are also shaped by them, it seems fitting to exploit the notions of both frames and 292 scenes to explicate gestural communication (e.g., Mittelberg and Waugh 2014; Sweetser 2012). As 293 proposed in earlier stages of the present account (e.g., Mittelberg 2017a/b, Mittelberg and Joue 294 2017), gestures that recruit frame structures tend to metonymically pick out essential elements and 295 salient qualities of scenes, that is, the motivating context of frames. This especially pertains to 296 situated factors of real-world, enactive experiences that can be recruited for both literal and 297 metaphorical construal and thus also involve primary scenes and primary metaphor (Grady 1997; see 298 also section 3). The ways in which embodied metonymy plays a central role in frame-based processes 299 that drive multimodal discourse pragmatics is discussed in the next section.
300

301 2.2.1 Frames and frame metonymy in co-speech gestures 302

303 Dancygier and Sweetser (2014: 102ff.) point out that, compared to domains, the structural 304 organization of frames allows for a more fine-grained and systematic account of correlations not only 305 within a frame (thus giving rise to frame metonymy), but also between two frames that are partially 306 mapped onto each other (thus giving rise to metaphor). They provide the following general definition 307 of metonymy: “the use of some entity A to stand for another entity B with which A is correlated” 308 (ibid.: 134, italics in the original). Frame metonymy refers “to all usages where one reference to an 309 element of a frame is used to refer to either the frame as a whole or to other associated elements of 310 the frame” (ibid.: 135), for example, where ‘the Crown’ refers to the British monarchy. Part-whole 311 frame metonymy includes what is generally understood by synecdoche, for example, where ‘field 312 hands’ stands for people who work outdoors on a farm.
313

314

An often-cited example is the RESTAURANT DINING frame (or script, see Schank and Abelson

315 1977); it implies elaborated scenarios involving certain culturally shaped sets of elements, roles,

316 behaviors, and sequences of events (Fillmore 1982). Seen from this perspective, Examples (1), (2),

317 (5), and (6) discussed in Section 2.1 involve items that are integral to this frame structure: the guest

318 who ordered the ham sandwich, the sandwich itself, table 5, the bread basket, ordering more bread,

319 and asking for the check. We are able to place and relate all these items within a structured, dynamic

320 fabric of correlations that allows us to quickly understand acts of indirect reference and other

321 metonymic operations occurring within it. Such larger frame structures, or scripts, are supposed to be

322 active in the background processing of cognition and behavior (e.g., Coulson 2001), in the sense that

323 one becomes aware of them if an element is omitted or occurs sequentially out of place; for example,

324 if someone asks for the bill before having consumed the dish that s/he ordered.

325

In processes of frame-based language use, reasoning, and discourse understanding, networks of

327 metonymic relations inherent to specific frames thus become activated and operationalized (e.g.,

328 Coulson 2001; Dancygier and Sweetser 2014). Thereby, each frame structure provides various

329 springboards for metonymic associations as well as entry points and conceptual bridges for

330 intersubjective meaning construction in conversational exchanges or collaborative story telling. In 331 ongoing interaction, speakers may use linguistic, gestural, or eye-gaze cues to frame a given scene in 332 positive, critical, doubtful, or humorous terms, from a scene-internal or a scene-external viewpoint, 333 or by adopting several viewpoints simultaneously (e.g., Dudis 2004; McNeill 1992; Sweetser 2012; 334 see Mittelberg 2017c on the interplay of viewpoint, indexicality, and metonymy in gesture). Alluding 335 to a particular discourse-relevant frame element may automatically trigger connections of different 336 scope and varying complexity, for example, to directly correlated elements, the frame as a whole, or 337 metaphoric associations.
338

339

With regard to the typing gesture described in the introductory section, a decisive detail lies in the

340 fact that understanding the message involves a cross-modally instantiated, frame-internal metonymic

341 process. So, again, if I imitate typing with both hands while saying to a friend:

342

343

(8) I’ll be working the entire weekend on my paper.

344

345 the pantomimed action of typing not only gets profiled against the ground of the imaginary keyboard, 346 thus evoking the TYPING and WRITING frames, but also against the backdrop of larger frame 347 structures, such as WRITING AN ACADEMIC PAPER or PUBLISHING. Note that in the verbal 348 part of the utterance, the verb does not refer to the gesturally simulated typing action, but to the more 349 general WORK frame. Hence, a cross-modal metonymic process takes place whereby the gesture 350 specifies the verbally communicated information ‘I’ll be working’ as ‘typing’ or ‘writing’ a 351 manuscript. For the interlocutors, this visuo-kinetic sign (including the imaginary keyboard) may 352 instantly serve as a dynamically created material anchor (Hutchins 2005) for joint attention and thus 353 evoke aspects of their shared experience of such situations. In this way, webs of associations may 354 branch out from such a mutual gestural anchor: In their respective embodied minds, this may 355 facilitate associations that are not only directly grounded in physical experience, such as 356 manipulating a keyboard or touchpad, but also bring to mind less tangible associations, such as 357 subsequent phases of the work process, the potential structure and content of the paper, a previously 358 co-authored paper, as well the community’s reaction (see also Calbris 2011: 10f.). Through activating 359 the WEEKEND frame, they might also think of what one misses out on while working the entire 360 weekend. For both the speaker and the interlocutor(s), frame-metonymic associations are thus also 361 likely to solicit subjective and intersubjective dimensions connected with certain mental or emotional 362 states, such as being focused, anxious, or happily working away (see also Mittelberg and Waugh 363 2014).
364

365

Regarding linguistic expressions, Dancygier and Sweetser (2014: 108) further emphasize that a

366 certain degree of salience is needed to clearly associate a term with a frame in the sense of 367 Langacker’s (1987) notion of active zone as the profiled part of a whole.4 For a body-based and

368 action-based view of metonymic processes (Mittelberg 2017a), it is particularly relevant that the

369 human body forms a metonymically structured whole in and of itself. Certain parts of it, for example,

4 Langacker (2009: 48) defines active zones as follows: “An entity’s active zone, with respect to a profiled relationship, is that facet of it which most directly and crucially participates in that relationship.”

Visuo-kinetic signs are inherently metonymic

370 the head or hands, may become prominent in a meaning-making process such as in the verbal 371 example of ‘field hands’ mentioned above. In this kind of part-for-whole frame metonymy “the part 372 centrally or directly involved in an activity stands for the whole. The hand, for example, is the part of 373 the arm used for holding, touching, etc.; hence it is the active zone of the arm for many purposes” 374 (Dancygier and Sweester 2014: 144).

375

Visuo-kinetic signs performed by heads, shoulders, and/or hands may also function as the

376 signifying, active zone of the gesturer’s body that ‘stands out’ within dynamic multimodal

377 contextures and may thus become meaningful. Furthermore, these signs may metonymically stand for

378 the entire person making the gesture – or for the belief system behind a certain stance s/he is 379 expressing towards what is being said (see also Calbris 1990 on body segments).5

380

381 2.2.2 Gestural frame evocation at varying levels of groundedness and complexity 382

383 Building on Fillmore’s (1977, 1982) notion of semantic frames, Mittelberg (2017a) has recently

384 presented a frame-based account of gesture pragmatics. It proposes different kinds of embodied

385 frame structures that are situated at varying levels of groundedness, schematicity, and complexity, a

386 synopsis of which will be presented here.

387

388

First, basic physical action frames and basic object frames are understood as being directly

389 grounded in physical experience and basic scenes (Mittelberg 2017a: 215ff.). These strongly

390 embodied frames mainly encompass prototypical events (Slobin 1985) such as pushing, pulling, and

391 teasing apart; mimetic schemas (Zlatev 2014) such as jump, kick, grasp, and hit; basic-level actions

392 (Lakoff 1987) such as eating, running, and walking; as well as any other intransitive, transitive or

393 ditransitive actions that may be simulated via gestures and whole-body enactments (e.g., Bressem

394 and Müller 2014; Hostetter and Alibali 2008; Müller 2017). In addition, basic physical action frames

395 may intertwine with basic object frames to account for the physical entities that the former, together

396 with their affordances, typically imply (as in Figures 1 and 4; see also Grady 1997 on primary 397 scenes).6 Basic object frames also get evoked in multimodal descriptions of physical entities or

398 spaces.

399

400

Second, more complex frame structures comprise frames that are internally more differentiated,

401 more detached from the motivating contexts of experience and hence situated at higher levels of

402 abstractness (Mittelberg 2017a: 220ff.). Presupposing the “development of a complex frame out of

403 correlated simpler frames” (Dancygier and Sweetser 2014: 138), we will first consider frame

404 structures that are composed of several connected basic action or object frames and hence exhibit an

405 intermediate level of groundedness. The RESTAURANT DINING script (see Section 2.2.1), for

406 example, consists of such a culturally shaped ordered set of basic actions and their implied objects

407 and/or interacting persons that are fairly well grounded and may thus function as experiential

408 anchors: being seated, looking at the menu, signaling to the waiter, eating, paying, etc. Each of the

409 sequenced actions and behaviors involve physical activities and can thus be easily enacted through

5 In sign language, body partitioning (Dudis 2004) also draws on the metonymic organization and affordances of the signer’s body to adopt and combine different viewpoints on a given scene. 6 See Mittelberg and Joue (2017) on gestural source actions as metonymic bases of metaphoric processes.

410 postures, gestures, and facial mimics, and hence evoke other, correlated items or the overarching

411 frame as a whole.

412

413

Highly abstract complex frame structures are understood as being a lot more detached from

414 motivating contexts than the frames discussed so far. They involve cognitive and semiotic structures

415 and activities that people rely on when producing or describing phenomena at a meta-level, for

416 instance, linguistic structures, genre-dependent narrative and conversational patterns, plots of novels,

417 films, or animated cartoons, mental maps, as well as knowledge systems and schematic conceptual

418 structures such as theories or category systems (Mittelberg 2017a: 223f.). In gesture, such larger

419 architectures may be overtly represented and thus become visible, albeit minimally and fleetingly, via

420 virtual time lines traced in the air (e.g., Calbris 2011) or other diagrammatic configurations of points

421 placed in gesture space that highlight how individual words, items, places, events, concepts, or more

422 general discourse contents relate to one another temporally, spatially, or logically (e.g., Bressem

423 2014; Enfield 2009; Kendon 2004; Mittelberg 2008). Beat gestures (McNeill 1992) are also a means

424 to accentuate particularly relevant parts of an utterance, thus making them metonymically stand out

425 from the speech chain as a whole.

426

427

Let us now look at how basic and more complex frames may interact in organizing a thematic unit

428 of multimodal discourse. Example (9) is taken from a description of a past vacation scene produced

429 in the context of a travel-planning task. Suggesting Hungary as a possible destination on a joint trip

430 through Europe, the person on the right in Figure 2 is telling her conversational partner in German

431 that on a previous visit to Budapest the weather was very nice. By mentioning that it was beautiful

432 outside (‘it… was really nice’), the speaker verbally evokes the WEATHER frame in an indirect

433 fashion. She then profiles a specific sub-frame against the backdrop of the larger, general

434 WEATHER frame by uttering the compound noun ‘Schwimmwetter’ (swimming weather).7

435

436

(9) es (...) war richtig schön und so [Schwimmwetter]

437

(it (…) was really nice and like [swimming weather])

438

439

The simultaneously produced visuo-kinetic sign shown in Figure 2, consisting of simulated

440 swimming movements performed by the speaker’s hands and arms, renders this specification salient.

441 This gesture can be said to activate the basic physical action frame SWIMMING. Not all the body

442 parts usually involved in swimming participate in this partial, stylized iconic enactment of a learned

443 motor routine. With reference to Hostetter and Alibali’s (2008) gestures-as-simulated-action (GSA)

444 framework, this gestural action exemplifies how “gestures emerge from the perceptual and motor

445 simulations that underlie embodied language and mental imagery” (Hostetter and Alibali 2008: 502).

446 Under the present view, this is another example of how communicative gestures may metonymically

447 evoke the physical actions they are imitating iconically by only minimally enacting the onset or some

448 essential characteristics of a full-blown action routine in a rather schematic fashion.

449

7 Another way to express such a relation is to say that a detail is profiled against the backdrop of a cultural model (Cienki 1998) or an idealized cognitive model (Lakoff 1987).

451

Looking at the immediate discourse context of this bimodal performance reveals that it belongs to

452 a vivid description, provided in (10), in which several gestures portray additional aspects that belong

453 to what seems a general, yet culture-dependent, understanding of WARM WEATHER. Enquiring

454 about the weather conditions on this past trip, the participant on the left actually first evokes the

455 WINTER frame: He asks whether there was snow and simultaneously makes a bimanual Palm-Up

456 Open Hand gesture (PUOH, Müller 2004), shown in Figure 3a. This pragmatic gesture functions here

457 as a visuo-kinetic question marker, or an interactive seeking gesture (Bavelas et al. 1995), that is

458 soliciting an answer from his interlocutor in an ‘empty-handed’ manner (see also Bressem and Müller

459 2014; Kendon 2004; Streeck 2009). His interlocutor then replies that it was actually rather nice and

460 warm.

461

462

(10) PLeft: lag Schnee?

[was there snow?]

463

Pright: nein (-) es war schon warm

467

und so [Schwimmwetter].

and like [swimming weather]

468

469

PLEASE PLACE FIGURE 3 ABOUT HERE

470

471

When explaining that it was “t-shirt weather” the speaker on the right rotates both hands at

472 approximately shoulder height with the palms facing towards the t-shirt she is wearing (Figure 3b).

473 This gesture may be interpreted as pointing to the short sleeves of her t-shirt. Considered as a cyclic

474 gesture (Ladewig 2011), it may also evoke the idea of continuously feeling hot or of sensing hot air

475 surrounding the body. The speaker then accompanies her verbal utterance “shorts weather” with

476 another bimanual gesture: With the palms facing the torso, the outer edges of the hands indicate the

477 location on her thighs where shorts typically end (Figure 3c). Only then does she multimodally

478 activate the SWIMMING frame as described earlier (Figures 2 and 3d). These individual,

479 metonymically linked frame elements jointly draw on the WARM WEATHER frame as a whole. In

480 this way, the semantic structures evoked in Example (10) involve several, metonymically correlated

481 frame elements and are thus more complex than the individual basic physical action frame

482 (SWIMMING) and the basic physical object frames (T-SHIRT, SHORTS) which constitute them.

483 Larger frames at this intermediate level of groundedness are still rooted in habitual, mundane

484 physical and social activities and thus may draw on various “scenes basic to human experience”

485 (Goldberg 1995: 5).8

486

487

Indeed, scenes have been found to be particularly relevant with respect to how interlocutors

488 construe and follow processes of online meaning construction. According to Fillmore (1977: 1226),

489 “in most natural conversations, the participants have, already ‘activated’, a number of shared,

8 For examples of highly abstract complex frame structures, see Mittelberg (2017a: 223ff.). 12
This is a provisional file, not the final typeset article

Visuo-kinetic signs are inherently metonymic

490 presupposed, scenes that we can speak of as being in their consciousness as they speak.” This 491 supports the idea that scenes partake in the dynamic contexts that shape multimodal processes of 492 conceptualization during both the production and interpretation of co-speech gestures. A frame-based 493 understanding of multimodal discourse pragmatics has the advantage of including larger semantic 494 networks that go beyond local reference or individual simulated actions, thus leading into discourse495 driven processes of more complex meaning construction.
496

497

Although the different kinds of frame structures discussed so far only pertain to concrete actions

498 and objects, they may, in principle, also underpin metaphoric construal in gesture (e.g., Dancygier

499 and Sweetser 2014; Mittelberg and Joue 2017). This line of inquiry also leads into related linguistic

500 issues such as how embodied scenes and frame metonymy may factor into related syntactic frames,

501 grammaticalization in gesture, as well as multimodally instantiated constructions (e.g., Mittelberg

502 2017b; Zima and Bergs 2017; see Section 3).

503

504 2.3 Reference and pragmatic inferencing in gesture 505

506 Exploring how metonymy motivates gestural practices of frame evocation necessarily raises 507 questions concerning reference and inference. While these complex issues cannot be resolved here, 508 let us pursue the idea that many gestures tend to evoke frames and enact or simulate physical actions 509 rather than represent or refer to things or actions in the real world (e.g., McNeill 2005; Merleau510 Ponty 1962; Mittelberg 2018). Unlike spoken and signed languages, most spontaneous gestures do 511 not rely on fully coded form-meaning pairings on the basis of which referential processes typically 512 function. Rather, habituated inferences based on habitual actions as well as habits of gesture 513 production and interpretation seem to play a central role in how gestures signify. Here, a parallel may 514 be drawn with how metonymy plays a role in catalyzing inferential and referential interactions in 515 language, as Barcelona points out:

516

517

Metonymy has this inferential role because of its ability to mentally activate the implicit pre-

518

existing connection of a certain element of knowledge or experience to another. The

519

referential function of metonymies is thus a useful (hence extremely frequent) consequence of

520

their inference-guiding role since what we do when we understand a referential metonymy is

521

to infer the referential intentions of others (Nerlich and Clarke 2001). (Barcelona 2009: 369)

522

523 Metonymic inferences in co-speech gestures may occur within the gestural modality or cross524 modally, that is, triggered by a linguistic cue (e.g., Mittelberg 2017a). Experientially entrenched 525 pragmatic inferences (Dancygier and Sweetser 2014: 144) are indeed key to mentally simulating and 526 understanding the communicative intentions of the gestural actions performed by others. As we saw 527 earlier, Figure 1 demonstrates a habitual metonymic correlation between gesturing hands and the 528 cutting action they are simulating: The apple is seemingly being held down by one hand, while the 529 seemingly held knife in the other is not referred to in the speech chain, but implied in the action. 530 Performing an “inference-guiding role,” the gesture here can be said to activate an “implicit pre531 existing connection of a certain element (…) of experience to another” (Barcelona 2009: 369). 532 Gesturally triggered metonymic pathways of this nature may be seen as natural inference schemata

13

Visuo-kinetic signs are inherently metonymic

533 (Panther and Thornburg 2003: 8) or vital relations (Fauconnier and Turner 2002: 93ff.): They 534 intuitively draw on people’s embodied, situated ways of functioning not only in the physical world, 535 but also in imaginary and/or abstract worlds (e.g., Sweetser 2007, 2012).
536

537

For example, arriving at the contextualized meaning of the quick gestural indications in Figure 3

538 relies on several cross-modal processes of pragmatic inferencing. Understanding these gestural

539 portrayals as illustrating the WARM-WEATHER frame requires integrating the verbal utterance in

540 (10) with information that is made visually salient. Apart from the iconic swimming gesture, the

541 other frame elements mentioned in speech, such as the t-shirt and shorts, are evoked in a rather

542 approximate way. In this multimodal portrayal, we can identify the following inferential pathways:

543 Two lead from the gesturing hands to the respective body parts and indicated items of clothing.

544 Through the indexicality inherent to these gestures, what they allude to briefly constitutes a

545 signifying, active zone (Langacker 1987) that is profiled and thus perceptually foregrounded in this

546 instance of multimodal meaning elaboration (see Section 2.1). Together these pathways lead more

547 globally into the WARM-WEATHER frame, in the context of which these specific garments are

548 commonly worn in combination. In these cases, but also more generally, the concurrent speech

549 content is needed to disambiguate, via inferential processes, especially those gestures that only

550 vaguely allude to something in the interlocutors’ environment or evolving discourse context.

551

552

So, although reference is one of metonymy’s chief functions, processes of pragmatic inferencing

553 are often more crucially involved in assuring a gesture’s communicative function, at least from the

554 perspective of the interpreter. Further gesture research is clearly needed to gain a fuller understanding

555 of how speech and gesture interact in cross-modal processes of pragmatic inferencing including those

556 that involve less accessible targets, for instance, through metaphoric construal (Mittelberg 2006,

557 2017a).9 We will now look more closely at the junctures where such inferences tend to take place

558 within visuo-kinetic signs.

559

560 2.4 Contiguity relations operationalized in co-speech gestures 561

562 From a semiotic perspective, similarity (iconicity), contiguity (indexicality), and conventionality 563 (symbols, habits) constitute the three fundamental semiotic relations that may be established between 564 a material sign carrier and what it signifies; in any given sign process, they typically mix to varying 565 degrees (Peirce 1960). The present proposal emphasizes that motivation in gesture relies on both 566 similarity and contiguity and that both modes usually also interact with various pressures of 567 conventionalization (e.g., Mittelberg 2006, 2013, 2014). According to Peirce (1960), contiguity 568 encompasses different kinds of factual connections, notably physical impact, contact, and adjacency, 569 as well as temporal and spatial proximity or distance. All of these may underpin indexical sign 570 processes in which the material sign, for example, fingerprints left at a crime scene, points the 571 interpreting mind towards the “object,” namely the person whose fingers caused traces of their 572 impressions to adhere to surfaces through physical contact. Generally speaking, there are 573 innumerable latent contiguity relations out there in the world, in our imagination, and in our

9 See also Calbris (2011: 78ff.) on body-focused gestures and Mittelberg and Waugh (2014) on body part indices. 14
This is a provisional file, not the final typeset article

Visuo-kinetic signs are inherently metonymic

574 embodied knowledge structures that may be operationalized when we are reasoning and 575 communicating. This section will focus on contiguity relations that the speaker’s body forms with the 576 physical or the imaginary world at her/his fingertips and that are intuitively drawn upon for 577 multimodal meaning-making (cf. Table 1 for an overview of the Peircean and Jakobsonian semiotic 578 concepts discussed in this section).
579

580

Within cognitive linguistics, contiguity relations underpinning metonymic expressions are

581 understood as either objectively given or cognitively construed (e.g., Dirven and Pörings 2002;

582 Panther and Radden 1999). They are assumed to be contingent (Panther and Thornburg 2003), that is

583 to say, they may be cancelled. These views are highly relevant to bodily semiotics and visuo-kinetic

584 signs, for gesticulating hands typically do not manipulate real physical objects or surfaces; they only

585 pretend to do so (as in simulating typing a paper, Example (8)). In their prototype approach to

586 conceptual contiguity and metonymy, Peirsman and Geeraerts (2006) posit the spatial and material

587 domain as the prototypical core of contiguity. They present a continuum of strength of contact as the

588 basis for spatial, temporal, as well as abstract domains (including events, actions, processes, and

589 assemblies). For instance, in the spatial/material domain, the continuum extends from spatial 1)

590 part/whole (e.g., head/person) to less prototypical cases, such as 2) containment/container (e.g.,

591 milk/glass), 3) location/located (e.g., house/inhabitants), and 4) entity/adjacent entity (e.g.,

592 person/clothing). The first is equivalent to a part-whole-frame metonymy. Reflecting diminishing

593 degrees of strength of contact, the second captures the relationship between a bread basket and bread

594 (as discussed in Section 3), the third captures the relationship between a table and a client sitting at a

595 table (as in Example (2)), and the last captures the connection between the speaker’s legs in Example

596 (10) and the shorts she refers to verbally. We will now consider a view of contiguity that makes

597 comparable distinctions, but places emphasis differently.

598

599

Jakobson’s (1956) account of contiguity relations has proven to be particularly suitable to describe

600 the functions that metonymy may assume in experientially motivated gestural signs (Mittelberg 2006,

601 2010, 2013; Mittelberg and Waugh 2009, 2014). In his writings on aphasic disorders, Jakobson

602 (1956) showed just how deeply rooted the distinction between similarity (iconicity/metaphor) and

603 contiguity (indexicality/metonymy) is. Furthermore, he differentiated contiguity relations in the

604 physical world, for example, between a knife and a fork, and those which combine items in a

605 semiotic contexture, for example, linguistic units jointly forming a syntagm or a discourse (Dirven

606 and Pörings 2002; Hopper and Traugott 2003; Waugh and Monville-Burston 1990). Of particular

607 relevance to understanding how metonymy is operationalized in gesture is Jakobson’s distinction

608 between inner contiguity and outer contiguity. The following visual scene serves to illustrate these

609 different operations, which will be applied to gesture below:

610

611

One must – and this is most important – delimit and carefully consider the essential difference

612

between the two aspects of contiguity: the exterior aspect (metonymy proper), and the interior

613

aspect (synecdoche, which is close to metonymy). To show the hands of a shepherd in poetry

614

or the cinema is not the same as showing his hut or his herd […]. The operation of

615

synecdoche, with the part for the whole or the whole for the part, should be clearly

616

distinguished from metonymic proximity. […] the difference between inner and outer

617

contiguity […] marks the boundary between synecdoche and metonymy proper.

619 620 PLEASE PLACE TABLE 1 ABOUT HERE 621 622 623 2.4.1 Inner contiguity: Parts, phases, contours, and essential qualities
624

625 Inner contiguity underlies part-whole relationships, that is, between a part and another part, a part and 626 the whole, or the whole and the part (Jakobson and Pomorska 1983). Internal metonymy 627 operationalizes these kinds of contiguity relations inherent to a given gestalt. For instance, in 628 everyone lives under one roof, ‘roof’ evokes the entire house of which it constitutes a physical 629 fragment. Hence, internal metonymy entails that the inner structure of a body, entity, or action is 630 broken down into its component parts, phases, or any other characteristic, and that one of them is 631 taken to imply a connected component or the entire gestalt structure.
632

633

In manual gestures and whole-body enactments, internal metonymy establishes a predominantly

634 iconic ground for signification (Mittelberg 2013, 2014; Peirce 1960; Sonesson 2007). That is, it relies

635 upon a metonymic rendition of what it signifies based on a perceived or construed similarity. Internal

636 metonymy may thus motivate processes of profiling and highlighting prototypical, or locally salient,

637 aspects of a given, existent or imagined, experience or gestalt. For instance, a gesturally enacted

638 onset, path, or manner of motion may evoke, in an abstracted and idealized manner, the

639 corresponding, fully articulated physical action (e.g., the swimming gesture in Figure 2) or motion

640 event (e.g., McNeill 1992). It is via metonymy that iconic gestures may also give salience to

641 contours, shapes, spatial dimensions, and other relevant qualities of objects, spaces, and other kinds

642 of physical structures (Mittelberg and Waugh 2014). In the study on transitive action gestures

643 mentioned in Section 2.1 (Grandhi et al. 2011), an alternative way of enacting the apple-slicing

644 scenario (Figure 1) was to use the hands as if they were the apple and the knife respectively, rather

645 than pretending to handle them. Figure 4 shows two slightly different variants of this gestural

646 technique, exemplifying the representing mode, according to Müller (1998, 2014).

653

654 In Figure 4 (Examples (11) and (12)), both of the participants’ hands exemplify the working of

655 internal metonymy: The flat, vertically held hand looks and functions like the blade of a knife, that is,

656 like the part of the kitchen tool would actually cut into an apple; the other, non-dominant hand forms

657 a fist, thus resembling a round object, which, in this case, signifies an apple. Furthermore, the

658 participant shown in Figure 4 b/c opens up his hand, representing the apple, at the very moment when

659 ‘the knife’ hits it, so that his fingers may be taken to iconically portray the apple slices resulting from

660 the repeated cutting action in a schematic and partial fashion. In this visually effective instance of a

661 gestural CAUSE-EFFECT metonymy, the semiotic affordances of the manual articulators are thus

662 exploited to a great extent.

664 2.4.2 Outer contiguity: In touch with the physical, social, and imagined world 665

666 Outer contiguity underlies metonymic expressions in which the profiled element is not part of, but

667 externally contiguous and/or pragmatically related to the element that it enables an addressee to infer.

668 External metonymy may draw on various kinds of outer contiguity relations and imply different

669 degrees of metonymic proximity, such as contact, adjacency, impact, and cause/effect (Jakobson and

670 Pomorska 1983: 134). For instance, with respect to the metonymic source expressions “the ham

671 sandwich” (Example (1)) and “table 5” (Example (2)) referring to a restaurant client, the relevant

672 contiguity relations hold between the client and the dish ordered earlier (temporal contiguity) and the

673 table s/he is sitting at (spatial contiguity).

674

675

In gesture, contiguity holds between hands and the objects, tools, and surfaces with which

676 speakers are (seemingly) in touch when communicating. Indexically anchoring the give and take of

677 conversational exchanges in the actions of the human body, the material and social environment, or

678 in imagined spaces (Mittelberg 2017c; Sweetser 2012), gestures readily (re-)establish and highlight

679 such relations by instigating metonymic modes that operate at junctures of gesturing hands and

680 contiguous persons or entities (as in the transitive action gesture in Figure 1).10

681

682

In Figure 5, for instance, the purpose of the gestural enactment is not to iconically imitate

683 someone who is holding something. While this is, via internal metonymy, the perceivable starting

684 point of the enacted meaning construction, it is the imaginary entity, externally contiguous to the

685 PUOH seemingly supporting it, that the speaker is verbally drawing attention to. In Example (13), the

686 architecture student is describing an analogy between the architectural design process and a musical

687 episode. Due to the basic physical action frame of holding a physical object, it is easy to infer a

688 generic object. The latter here stands for an abstract concept, an analogy, via an embodied

689 metonymic inference mechanism based on immediate metonymic proximity of the open palm and the

690 imagined object. It is through action-based, metaphorical reification that the analogy becomes a

691 tangible and thus intersubjectively sharable element in the discourse context (Mittelberg 2008;

692 Mittelberg and Joue 2017).

700

Under the present view, it is through a cross-modal process of pragmatic inferencing and a low

701 degree of indexicality (Mittelberg 2017a/b) that the PUOH is pointing to the existence and relevance

10 See Mittelberg and Waugh (2014) for a typology of predominantly indexical or iconic gestures, metonymic chains triggered by gestures, and a continuum spanning varying degrees of metonymic proximity.
17

Visuo-kinetic signs are inherently metonymic

702 of the verbally referenced analogy. Concurrently, the speaker’s right hand with the palm turned 703 downward is oriented towards his left hand and thus creates an additional index leading to the 704 analogy. This gesture thus heightens the relevance of an idea that seems to be physically graspable 705 through the ongoing multimodal description.
706

707

These observations further support the idea that the source meaning, embodied in the form of a

708 hand configuration and/or movement, remains present and perceptually salient in metonymic

709 mappings, while the target meaning, that is, the discourse contents (such as the analogy in Figure 5)

710 is cognitively prominent in the ongoing exposition (e.g., Panther and Thornburg 2004: 95, 105;

711 Mittelberg 2006). We can also say that such object-oriented action gestures may trigger a frame-

712 internal metonymic shift at outer contiguity junctions constituted by the hands and the virtual objects

713 and tools they seem to be holding or manipulating (Mittelberg and Waugh 2014). For example, the

714 apple-slicing scenario in Figure (7) exemplifies the underlying metonymic mapping ACTION-FOR-

715 OBJECT INVOLVED IN ACTION; in addition, the gesture in Figure 5 simultaneously relies on the

716 relation PRESENTATION-FOR-PRESENTED (e.g., Barcelona 2009; Panther and Radden 1999;

717 Panther and Thornburg 2003; see also Mittelberg and Joue 2017 on gestural framing actions). In both

718 cases, what we actually see are the physical actions, but through following the linguistic cues in the

719 unfolding discourse our attention shifts to the implied items and ideas.

720

721

A recent study combining behavioral and brain-imaging experiments (Joue et al. 2018) provides

722 some initial neuroscientific evidence for processing differences that seem to broadly reflect the

723 metonymic principles distinguished by Jakobson (Jakobson and Pomorska 1983) and discussed in

724 this section. The study participants were shown video recordings of persons verbally describing and

725 gesturally performing actions in which an object/tool in question was either represented by a

726 finger/hand (internal metonymy or body-part-as-object) or the person was pretending to be holding

727 or otherwise manipulating an object or tool (external metonymy or pantomime; see, e.g., Lausberg et

728 al. 2003). Results suggest that metonymy may guide an interpreting mind to focus primarily on either

729 locally relevant features (part-for-whole metonymy) or more globally relevant aspects (frame

730 metonymy) of what is being communicated (Joue et al. 2018; see also Grandhi et al. 2011 on a user

731 study showing clear preferences for external metonymy).

732

733 2.5 Experiential, metonymic bases for metaphoricity in gesture 734

735 Metonymy and metaphor have been found to interact to varying degrees in language and other 736 multimodal forms of communication (e.g., Barcelona 2000; Benczes et al. 2011; Goossens 1990; 737 Hampe 2017; Jakobson 1956; Köveczes 2013; Littlemore 2015; Mittelberg 2002, 2008; Panther et al. 738 2009; Radden 2000; Ruiz de Mendoza Ibanez 2017). Investigating how indexical and iconic 739 principles jointly guide the interpretation of predominantly metaphoric gestures, Mittelberg and 740 Waugh (2009) suggest two distinct but intertwined semiotic processes in which metonymy leads into 741 metaphor. For example, to reconstruct the meaning of the gesture evoking an analogy in Figure 5, we 742 can first assume a process of metonymic inferencing as described in Sections 2.3 and 2.4. The 743 metonymic source, namely the flat open hand involved in the source action (Mittelberg and Joue 744 2017) of holding something, points to the adjacent metonymic target: the virtual object involved in 745 the action. Second, the same imaginary object serves as the source of the metaphoric mapping whose 746 target is the abstract notion of analogy referred to verbally (see also Meir 2010 and Taub 2001on

18
This is a provisional file, not the final typeset article

Visuo-kinetic signs are inherently metonymic

747 double mappings in sign language). Note that in this example of a gesturally enacted metaphor, the

748 concurrent speech is non-figurative (see also Mittelberg 2008, 2014; Cienki and Müller 2008).

749

750

Furthermore, the gesture in Figure 5 is an instance of a gesturally expressed primary metaphor

751 (Grady 1997; Hampe 2017), namely IDEAS ARE OBJECTS. It thereby evokes the basic physical

752 action and object frame of handling objects (Mittelberg 2017a), which involves a primary scene

753 (Grady 1997), a prototypical event (Slobin 1985), and a scene basic to human experience (Goldberg

754 1995; as discussed in Section 2.2.2). It is hence central to the present perspective on multimodal

755 metonymy that “(f)rame metonymy is closely tied to the kind of correlations which are involved in

756 experientially based metaphors, in particular Primary Metaphors (…). It is precisely the development

757 of a complex frame out of a correlated simpler frame which makes a primary scene so powerful”

758 (Dancygier and Sweetser 2014: 137). We can draw from these insights that metaphoricity in gesture

759 needs to be analyzed in view of its experientially grounded, metonymic bases, which may be

760 predominantly iconic or predominantly indexical (e.g., Mittelberg and Waugh 2014). This also

761 further supports the idea that metonymy is experientially more basic than metaphor. (Cf. Table 2 for

762 an overview of the different approaches to metonymy discussed in this section.)

767

768 3 Metonymy underpins schematic gestural patterns and fully codified visuo-kinetic signs
769 770 Throughout the foregoing discussion, we have seen how metonymic modes may motivate various 771 processes of experientially grounded abstraction and schematization with respect to particular 772 gestures. We will now consider how metonymy may be said to also underpin the emergence of 773 gestural patterns (in Section 3.1) as well as fully coded visuo-kinetic signs (in Section 3.2). 774 775 Although gestures and signed languages largely share the same articulators and space as a medium of 776 articulation, they also differ in the ways in which they are ‘visual’ and act as signs (e.g., Kendon 777 2014; Liddell 2003; Müller 2017; Perniss et al. 2010; Sweetser 2009; S. Wilcox 2004b). In many 778 discourse contexts, spontaneous gestures can afford to be quite allusive, idiosyncratically reduced 779 semiotic gestalts, for they do not need to fulfill well-formedness conditions in the way that emblems 780 and linguistic symbols in signed languages do. Gestures may in fact push metonymic form reduction 781 and schematization to quite extreme degrees. This is partly because, most of the time, gestures do not 782 carry the full load of meaning-making: The concurrent spoken utterance gives them a hand, so to 783 speak, thus disambiguating potentially polysemous hand shapes and movements (e.g., Calbris 2011; 784 Müller 1998). 785 786 A central point that this paper wishes to make is that using the umbrella term visuo-kinetic signs to 787 encompass co-speech gestures and signed languages allows us to elucidate some commonalities 788 regarding certain core principles of metonymically driven sign constitution and interpretation. 789 790

19

Visuo-kinetic signs are inherently metonymic

791 3.1 Enacted schematicity: Pragmatically driven patterns in co-speech gesture

792

793 A central goal in gesture research has been to identify patterns in gestural practices within and across

794 individual speakers, languages, discourses, contexts, communities, and cultures (e.g., Kendon 2004;

795 McNeill 2005; Streeck et al. 2011). Certain co-speech gestures have indeed been found to exhibit

796 relatively high degrees of patterning and conventionality. Under the present view on regularities in

797 gesture, conventionality strongly pertains to the Peircean (1960) notion of habit, rather than to

798 imposed, symbolic codes in the narrow sense of the term (Mittelberg 2006). Highly frequent and

799 routinized gestures, particularly those that (also) fulfill pragmatic functions, indeed show an

800 increased ‘visibility’ in multimodal interaction: for example, gesture families (e.g., Kendon 2004);

801 recurrent gestures such as the PUOH (Müller 2004, 2017) or the cyclic gesture (Ladewig 2011,

802 2014; see also Bressem 2014; Bressem and Müller 2014); and/or gestures enacting embodied image 803 and force schemas (e.g., Cienki 2013; Mittelberg 2008, 2018; Wehling 2017).11

804

805

Suggesting that scenes basic to human experience (Goldberg 1995: 5) may underpin entrenched

806 patterns in both language and gesture, it was argued in Section 2 (drawing on Mittelberg 2017a and

807 Mittelberg and Joue 2017) that certain gestures tend to metonymically profile salient aspects of

808 deeply embodied, routinized aspects of scenes, that is, the motivating context of semantic frames

809 (Fillmore 1977, 1982). The next logical steps of this rationale involve examining how metonymy

810 conditions gradual, pragmatically motivated processes of grammaticalization (Bybee 2010; Hopper

811 1998; Hopper and Traugott 2003) in gesture, how the resulting schematic gestures evoke correlated

812 syntactic frames (e.g., Goldberg 1995, 1998), and how they may partake in multimodally instantiated

813 constructions (e.g., Mittelberg 2017b; see also contributions in Zima and Bergs 2017). A full account

814 of these complex phenomena cannot be provided here, but we will see an example of how metonymy

815 factors into gestural schematicity below.

816

817

Regarding the meaning of constructions in language, Barcelona (2009) ascribes a fundamental

818 role to metonymy and pragmatic inferences (see also Panther et al. 2009). According to the present,

819 admittedly preliminary, consideration of comparable processes in gesture, habituated physical actions

820 and repeated similar acts of gesturing involve metonymy through propelling the establishment of not

821 only individual, metonymically reduced gestures, but also more schematic gestural patterns, notably

822 via discourse-driven routinization (e.g., Haiman 1994; Hopper and Traugott 2003) of certain physical

823 actions. Such commonly used, more strongly conventionalized, visuo-kinetic signs should evidence

824 the metonymic processes discussed in this paper to high degrees. Gestures displaying this increased

825 level of embodied schematicity are likely to combine referential (including metaphoric) and

826 pragmatic functions, and their interpretation can be expected to rely on entrenched processes of 827 pragmatic inferencing (such as the ones described in Section 2.3).12

828

829

For instance, basic manual actions, such as holding or giving something to someone, have been

830 shown to entail schematic scenes that underpin prototypical cases of transitive or ditransitive

831 argument structure in language (Goldberg 1995). In German, the full verb geben (give), a three-place

832 predicate, underwent a process of grammaticalization engendering the existential construction es gibt

833 ‘it gives’ (there is/are; Newman 1998). In a recent study on multimodal instantiations of this

11 Pointing gestures (e.g., Fricke 2007; Haviland 2000; Kendon 2004; McNeill 1992) are also commonly observed
gestural practices, but limits of space do not allow them to be included in the present discussion. 12 For a brain-imaging study on perceived conventionality in co-speech gestures see Wolf et al. (2017).

Visuo-kinetic signs are inherently metonymic

834 impersonal construction (Mittelberg 2017b), it has been argued that the manual action of giving also

835 serves as experiential substrate in processes of embodied grammaticalization that result in gestural

836 existential markers observed to co-occur with es gibt. These gestural markers tend to enact reduced

837 and more schematic variants of the full action of giving. To illustrate this point, let us revisit the

838 PUOH gesture in Figure 5 (discussed in Section 2.4.2). In his left hand, the participant is seemingly

839 holding the analogy he is talking about while using an es gibt construction to refer to it verbally

840 (Example 13). The basic sense of the full verb geben (give) as well as the basic scene it evokes still

841 resonate not only in this intransitive linguistic construction, but also in the gestural enactment that co-

842 occurred with it. In essence, metonymic reduction can be said to motivate such frequently occurring,

843 schematic communicative gestures out of fully fledged, object-oriented physical actions that

844 originally involve object transfer. The act of giving is reduced to an act of unimanual holding that

845 exhibits a decreased degree of transitivity and iconicity, thus evoking, for instance, a scene of

846 existence, or presence, rather than a scene of object transfer.

847

848

These grammaticalized gestural markers of existence tend to stay rather close to the speaker’s

849 body instead of reaching towards an (imagined) receiver. The hands are also more relaxed and reveal

850 less effort than would be necessary to actually hold something. In addition, these visuo-kinetic

851 existential markers tend to combine referential dimensions, afforded through metonymy, with modal

852 or epistemic, that is, pragmatic functions (e.g., Sweetser 1990). They also tend to express subjective

853 and interactive dimensions of meaning (e.g., Hopper and Traugott 2003), such as in Example 13,

854 where the speaker points out something that seems obvious to him (for further details and examples

855 see Mittelberg 2017b; see also Bressem and Müller 2014; Müller 2017). Reduced degrees of

856 iconicity and indexicality seem to push such commonly used gestures closer towards the juncture of

857 habit-driven, embodied grammaticalization and gesture pragmatics. Further research is clearly

858 needed to establish how these initial insights play out across speakers, languages, and discourse

859 contexts.

860

861

The observations discussed here are akin to work on grammaticalization in signed languages, in

862 the context of which gestures have been shown to serve as the substrate of certain lexical and/or

863 grammatical signs (Janzen and Shaffer 2002). Bearing this in mind, we will now turn to how

864 metonymy operates in signed language.

865

866 3.2 Metonymic principles operating in signed languages

867

868 Metonymy has been ascribed an important role in the construction of form and meaning in signed 869 languages, for example, in ASL (e.g., Liddell 2003; Mandel 1977; Taub 2001; P. Wilcox 2004; S. 870 Wilcox 2004a; Wilcox et al. 2003), French Sign Language (LSF; e.g., Bouvet 1997), German Sign 871 Language (DGS; e.g., Kutscher and Lincke 2012); and Israeli Sign Language (ISL; e.g., Meir 2010; 872 Meir and Cohen fc.). For instance, investigating how iconicity and metaphor interact in ASL, Taub 873 (2001) suggests a set of principles of sign constitution including image selection, schematization, and 874 encoding. Metonymy particularly comes into play at the image selection stage: The ASL sign for 875 ‘academic degree’ consists in showing the gestalt and length of a rolled-up diploma shaped like a 876 cylinder. The sign portrays a tangible element that is pragmatically correlated with the target meaning 877 within the same frame: “The degree itself is a nonphysical title, rather than a physical object, and so a 878 salient object is chosen for the purposes of creating an iconic sign” (Taub 2001: 46). 879

21

Visuo-kinetic signs are inherently metonymic

880 PLEASE PLACE FIGURE 6 (a-c) ABOUT HERE 881 882 Let us now see how internal and external metonymy (as introduced in Section 2.4) are manifested in 883 DGS. In Figure 6a, the lexical sign for ‘Baum’ (tree) exemplifies the workings of internal metonymy 884 in the form of a bimanually achieved schematic icon that profiles the salient, structural parts of a tree, 885 namely its trunk and branches, as well as the ground in which it is rooted. By contrast, the DGS sign 886 for ‘Banane’ (banana) is a good example of how outer contiguity relations between the hands and a 887 manipulated object are drawn upon to pragmatically infer what is signified (Figure 6 b/c). While 888 internal metonymy underpins the iconic hand shapes and movements as such, it is via external (or 889 frame) metonymy that the hands’ shapes and actions evoke the implied (invisible) fruit. Although the 890 peeling action is physically made salient, it is the object undergoing the action that is being referred 891 to via this iconic visuo-kinetic lexeme. The latter may be said to evoke a basic action and object 892 frame as discussed in Section 2.3 (Mittelberg 2017a), involving the metonymic mapping ACTION893 FOR-OBJECT INVOLVED IN ACTION (see Section 2; see also Wilcox et al. 2003). 894 895

896 4 Concluding remarks

897 The insights offered in the foregoing discussion provide further support for the idea that metonymy is

898 a fundamental principle that operates across different modalities of experience, thought, and

899 expression. The chief goal of this paper was to characterize and evidence the inherently metonymic

900 nature of co-speech gestures. Combining cognitive linguistic and semiotic perspectives on how

901 embodied metonymic principles may underpin the formation and interpretation of gestures, the

902 discussion has shown how a frame-based account may integrate related concepts such as scenes,

903 experiential domains, contiguity (indexicality), similarity (iconicity), and conventionality. Under this

904 unified view, these different concepts provide an insightful lens onto various experientially grounded

905 processes of metonymic motivation that tend to pragmatically induce, in one way or another, not only

906 the forms and functions, but also the habit-driven processes of patterning and schematization that are

907 discernable in gesture. We also saw gestural evidence for the claim that metonymy is experientially

908 more basic than metaphor and hence often feeds into correlated metaphoric processes.

909

910

How metonymy plays out in signed language could only be briefly touched upon here in

911 comparison to its role in co-speech gesture. We can preliminarily conclude that metonymic processes

912 typically apply on-the-fly and from scratch in gestures, whose forms and potential meanings are

913 highly context-dependent and not as strongly stabilized as they are in signed languages. However,

914 what I am suggesting here is that the set of metonymic principles discussed in this paper seem to

915 generally operate in visuo-kinetic signs, thus engendering similarly principled ways of forming

916 embodied signs, as well as guiding inferential processes that are implied in their interpretation.

917 Exactly how these metonymic mechanisms systematically compare and differ in gesture and signed

918 language, including gestures occurring within signed discourse, needs to be established through

919 future research across languages, modalities, and discourse genres. Empirical investigation into how

920 metonymic processes are conditioned by interacting experiential, physical, cognitive, cross-modal,

921 modality-specific, discourse, interactional, and cultural forces will no doubt further our

922 understanding of the complex dynamics of multimodal face-to-face interaction.
