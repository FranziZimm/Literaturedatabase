Preface
In th e 1950s , whe n I wa s a n undergraduate , basi c psycholog y seemed t o b e buil t ver y largel y o n wor k wit h animals . W e spent a good dea l o f time discussin g whethe r rat s i n maze s learne d whic h turns to make or which places to go to, or discussing how the rates at which the y presse d bar s depende d o n th e patter n o f rewards they received. Th e dominan t figur e o f the tim e was th e behavioris t B . F. Skinner. I remember als o the excitement of the ideas proposed b y D. O. Hebb, i n man y way s th e founde r o f modern neuroscienc e a s i t pertains t o psychology . I n al l o f this , i t seeme d t o b e take n fo r granted tha t th e same principle s o f behavior applie d t o humans a s to other animals , a n idea that seemed a t the time to have a vaguely subversive qualit y t o thos e o f u s wit h conventiona l upbringings . Indeed, I am afraid it was probably th e whiff of heresy that attracte d me away from mathematic s an d t o psychology.
But how things have changed! In my own department animal s are slowly but surel y disappearing, an d mainstrea m psycholog y is now based primarily on research with humans. No longer are we comfortable wit h th e assumptio n tha t result s base d o n animals ca n b e extrapolated t o ou r ow n species . Thi s chang e wa s due in part t o th e classic confrontation s o f th e lat e 1950 s an d earl y 1960 s betwee n Skinner an d Noa m Chomsky , a linguis t wh o revived the dualistic, Cartesian ide a tha t ther e i s a n unbounde d qualit y t o th e huma n mind that is not t o be found i n other animals . But change may have been i n th e win d anyway , since th e behavioris m o f the 1950 s an d 1960s had seeme d t o place a straitjacket o n the study of the mind. A new sens e o f th e specia l natur e o f humanit y emerged , an d suc h human-based topic s a s memory, attention, language, and consciousness moved to center stage .
This switc h fro m a n animal-base d t o a human-base d scienc e re flects a n age-ol d tension i n th e wa y we vie w ourselves. For much of our history we have seen ourselves as closer to God (or gods) than to the animals , bu t ther e ha s alway s been a heretica l an d ofte n sup -

pressed sens e o f ou r anima l nature . Thi s wa s reinforce d b y th e growth o f secular science , which provided mechanisti c accounts of the way our bodies worked , and indee d reveale d clos e parallels between th e working s of our ow n bodie s an d thos e o f other animals . For some time, scholars such as Descartes were still able to preserve at leas t a part of the human min d for some higher realm . Th e ultimate challenge , o f course, cam e fro m tha t mil d but far-seein g En glishman, Charles Darwin . At first reticent ove r the implication s of his theor y o f natural selection , he eventuall y made clea r hi s view that w e are indee d a part of the anima l kingdom , and shar e a common ancestry, not so remote, wit h the apes.
Even in a secular age , it still seems reasonable t o some to insist on a fundamental discontinuity between humans and other animals. In part, th e issu e ha s focuse d on th e supposedl y specia l natur e o f human language , and thi s i s discussed i n some detai l in the followin g chapters. It has also been argued that humans are endowed wit h a special kin d o f consciousness, includin g self-consciousness , that i s not possessed b y other animals. Thi s has proven a more intractabl e argument, partly because consciousnes s ha s proven peculiarly diffi cult t o define . Th e notion o f consciousness seem s t o depen d o n ou r own subjective sense of what it is to be conscious, and so long as this is so, other animals are placed a t a distinct disadvantage .
This boo k focuse s th e questio n o f huma n discontinuit y on lat erality. Although I was fearful tha t evidence on animal asymmetries would overtak e me , i t stil l seem s t o b e th e cas e tha t right handedness an d cerebra l asymmetr y ar e uniqu e t o humans — unique not so much in their presence as in their extent, pattern, and population bias. Moreover it is not laterality per se that is critical so much a s th e natur e o f functions tha t ar e lateralized , which them selves seem to capture muc h of the essence of what it is to be human.
Handedness i s related t o our extraordinar y abilit y to manufacture and manipulate , an d cerebra l asymmetr y is most pronounce d wit h respect t o that putativel y unique faculty, language.
In order t o develop my themes, I have been obliged to cover material from a range of disciplines, some outside my own areas of exper-
tise. I have therefore tried t o avoid excessive jargon and to write in a way tha t i s understandable t o nonspecialists. Since my own expertise is in cognitive psychology and neuropsychology, I am aware tha t my attempts t o do this are uneven. I am also aware that much of the material, especiall y tha t o n huma n evolution , is highly controversial, an d tha t m y conclusion s ma y b e see n b y som e a s biase d o r wrong. I hav e simpl y tried t o mak e th e bes t sens e o f the materia l that I could.
I have also tried t o make each chapter as autonomous as possible,

However, I have tried to organize the material in such a way that the case i s buil t u p i n logica l sequence , s o tha t reader s wit h widely ranging backgrounds can follow it .
I have used notes at the end of each chapter rather than references in th e tex t s o as no t t o interrup t th e flo w o f the text , and technica l details are sometimes covered in the notes. I have nevertheless provided a fairly comprehensive list of references. In this, I was mindfu l of a colleagu e wh o onc e wrot e t o m e t o sa y how muc h h e appreci ated a n earlie r boo k I wrote—because he found th e reference s useful. Anything to please.

Are Humans Unique?
What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason! How infinite i n faculty ! I n form , i n moving , how expres s an d admirable! I n actio n ho w lik e a n angel ! In apprehensio n how lik e a god ! Th e beaut y of the world ! The paragon of animals!
So SAI D HAMLET , i n a n outburs t o f huma n (an d male ) chauvinism. Admiration o f our ow n specie s i s a commo n huma n foible ; w e humans hav e lon g attribute d t o ourselve s specia l qualitie s o f mind , spirit, o r moralit y tha t ar e denie d al l othe r creatures . Religion s seem to play a special rol e in this by bestowing uniquely upon us an immortal sou l o r b y tracin g ou r origin s t o som e divin e act o f creation. Indeed, it ma y be argued tha t religions exist as much for the glorification of humans a s for the worship of gods. To quote from th e Psalms: "Wha t i s man , tha t tho u ar t mindfu l o f him? . . . For tho u hast mad e him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowne d him with glory and honour. "
According to the American historian Lyn n White, Jr., the Christian religion i n particula r i s "th e mos t anthropocentri c religio n th e world ha s seen," 1 standin g i n shar p contras t t o ancien t paganis m and Asia n religions, with th e possibl e exception of Zoroastrianism. Much of the Christian attitud e towar d animal s can be traced t o the book o f Genesis. The Garde n o f Eden wa s originall y a paradis e i n which Adam was granted dominion over all living creatures. During this blissful era, humans lived harmoniously with other animals and were no t carnivorous . Bu t wit h th e Fall , whe n human s rebelle d against God , things changed .

less fertile , an d pest s suc h a s thorns , thistles , gnats , an d flea s ap peared. The animals had t o be forced into submission, and humans became carnivorous .
After th e Flood, God gave humans a renewed but mor e repressive authority ove r the animals:

The fear o f you an d th e drea d o f you shall be upon every beast of the earth, an d upo n every fowl o f the air , upon all tha t moveth upon the
earth, an d upo n al l th e fishe s o f th e sea ; int o you r han d ar e the y delivered. Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you. (Genesis, ix. 2—3 )

This tex t indee d se t th e stag e fo r muc h o f Western history, with

human dominanc e par t o f th e divin e plan . I n eighteenth-century

England, fo r example, i t wa s widel y preached tha t th e domestica -

tion o f animals was goo d fo r them, and th e butcherin g of animals

was held to be kind rather than cruel since it spared them the suffer -

ing of old age. Even the killin g of animals for sport wa s justified, i n

tohveerwtohredcsroeaf tTuhreosm."a2s

Fulle r in 1642 , by "man's Th e killing of animals was

charter o f dominion also thought to have

a civilizin g influence on nativ e peoples. At the Grea t Exhibition of

1851 i n London , there wa s a boot h displayin g monkey skins fro m

Africa. On e observer noted the sufferin g tha t th e animals must have

undergone bu t adde d tha t "th e wor k o f catching these monkey s is civilizing the African." 3 Report s o f how Easter n religion s respected

the live s of other animal s wer e treate d wit h contempt , a s thoug h

they debased huma n ascendancy .

It would be wrong t o blame ou r attitude towar d animal s wholly

on the Christia n religion . Simila r attitude s ca n i n fact b e found i n

other religiou s doctrines . Fo r example , i n 163 2 it wa s sai d o f th e

American Indians tha t "the y have i t among the m b y tradition tha t

God mad e on e ma n an d on e woman an d bad e the m liv e together,

and get children, kill deer, beasts, birds, fish, and fowl and what they would a t thei r pleasure." 4 Besides , th e Ol d Testamen t i s no t un -

equivocal in its expressed attitud e towar d animals . In Proverbs (xii,

10) it is taught that a good man "regardet h th e life of his beast," and

in Hose a (ii , 18 ) it i s implie d tha t animal s ar e member s o f God's

covenant. St. Francis o f Assisi, whom Lynn White describes a s "the greatest spiritua l revolutionary in Western history,"5 tried valiantly

to place animal s o n an equal footin g with humans, but th e tide was

against him.

The trut h i s tha t ou r ver y surviva l has ofte n depende d on th e

exploitation of animals, which still serve as beasts of burden and a s

sources of food. In more recent times, animals have served the cause

Are Humans Unique? 5
of huma n medicine . The ter m "guine a pig " is no t confine d t o tha t pleasant an d cooperative animal but applie s even to the higher primates tha t mos t resembl e ourselves and tha t ca n therefore be used to test th e effectivenes s o f drugs o r surgica l procedures . O f course, not al l exploitatio n o f animals i s i n th e caus e o f human survival. Animals are stil l hunted an d kep t in unnatural confinemen t fo r entirely frivolou s reasons . Nevertheless , some degre e o f exploitation seems inevitable , and i t i s understandable tha t people should have sought justificatio n fo r thei r cruelt y i n term s o f divine principles. Religious attitudes toward animals are no doubt born of social practices rather than the reverse .
Negative attitudes toward animals are also sustained by the belief that animal s embod y th e base r huma n instinct s tha t nee d t o b e constantly repressed. In the sixteenth century, lust was said to make men "lik e . . . swine, goats , dog s an d th e mos t savag e an d brutis h beasts in the world."6 Words like "beastly," "brutish," and "swinish, " as reference s t o disagreeabl e huma n behavior , remain i n common parlance. Bodily functions suc h as eating, copulation, or evacuation remind us of our anima l natures, which may be why these function s are shroude d i n ritual o r secrecy . The idea o f the beast withi n also persists in twentieth-century thought, as in Sigmund Freud's notion of the libidinous, murderous i d that has constantl y to be restrained by the rational ego and th e censorious superego .
The exploitatio n o f animal s ha s neve r bee n completel y unre strained, however, an d th e ver y insistence of moral argument s for the killing of animals may owe something to the fact tha t people are naturally wel l dispose d t o man y animals . Horses , dogs , an d cat s have always been th e specia l objects of human affection ; ther e is a proverb tha t run s "H e canno t b e a gentlema n wh o lovet h no t a dog."7 Organization s suc h a s th e Societ y for th e Protectio n o f Cruelty t o Animals , or th e mor e recen t an d extrem e Anima l Right s Movement, hav e ensure d a t leas t som e measur e o f balance i n th e way we treat animals .
There has also been a long history of attempts to define the differ ence between humans and animals i n other tha n theological terms. Aristotle regarde d human s a s th e onl y politica l animals , whil e Thomas Willi s noted tha t human s wer e th e only creature s capabl e of laughter . Marti n Luthe r i n 153 0 pronounce d tha t a n essentia l difference betwee n humans and other creatures lay in the possession of privat e property . H e shoul d b e s o lucky . One eighteenth-century observer attached specia l importance to the nose: "Man is, I believe, the onl y anima l that ha s a marke d projectio n in th e middl e of the face."8
Aristotle also argued that human s were more beautifully forme d

than other animals, showing "a more exquisite symmetry of parts." This idea carries a special irony in the context of this book, since one of m y aim s i s t o evaluat e th e ide a th e specia l natur e o f huma n beings may lie, at least in part, in our asymmetry rather than in our symmetry. Other idea s tha t will be examined in this book also have historical antecedents . Benjami n Franklin seem s t o hav e been th e first to sugges t tha t i t wa s too l makin g that distinguishe d us fro m other species . Our erect posture , uniqu e among th e mammals, has long bee n th e focu s o f speculation , althoug h agai n th e argumen t often too k on a theological slant; Plato, for example, noted that only humans looked up to heaven, while the beasts wer e doomed to gaze forever downward. 9
There is no denying that humans ar e different fro m othe r species, just as other species are different fro m eac h other. The question that motivated th e writin g of this book , and tha t ha s motivate d a good deal of discussion for as lon g a s humans have pondere d thei r own condition, is whether th e difference betwee n humans and other species somehow represent s a special discontinuity . The most extreme position woul d b e tha t thi s discontinuit y is in effec t a dichotomy, unmatched by any other differenc e betwee n species. A more moderate position would b e that th e magnitude of the discontinuity is not unprecedented bu t i s matche d by , say, that betwee n animal s tha t
can an d canno t fly . Given th e extraordinar y similarit y i n geneti c structure betwee n ourselve s an d ou r closes t relative , the chimpanzee,10 it seems o n the fac e o f it unlikely that w e are quit e so special as w e ma y lik e to think—unles s we hav e indee d bee n touche d b y some divine wand. And yet, even in an objective sense, the scope of the human enterprise o n our planet, and even beyond, seems to belie the biological similarity between ourselves an d the other primates .

Descartes' Dichotomy
Although a concern wit h th e questio n o f human uniqueness can be traced back t o ancient times , moder n discussio n really begins with the seventeenth-century Frenc h philosophe r Ren e Descartes (15961650), ofte n regarde d a s th e founde r o f moder n philosophy . Descartes argue d fo r a dichotom y betwee n human s an d othe r species , but this is perhaps less remarkable tha n the way in which he framed the issues, foreshadowing some of the debates of the present time. In maintaining that humans were indeed fundamentally differen t fro m other species, he seems in fact t o have been guided at least in part by his religious principles: "After th e error o f those who deny God," he wrote, " . . . ther e i s none tha t lead s wea k mind s furthe r fro m th e

straight pat h of virtue than tha t of imagining that th e souls of beasts are o f the sam e natur e a s ours." 11 However, Descartes als o pu t for ward rationa l argument s fo r huma n uniquenes s tha t continu e t o exert an influence .
Descartes argue d tha t animals , unlik e humans , wer e mer e ma chines, or automata. I n this he was influenced i n part by his fascination wit h clockwor k model s o f animals, whic h wer e popular a t th e time, and i n part by the growing knowledge of anatomy and physiology. H e himself ha d mad e a substantia l contribution to our knowledge of the working s of the eye by dissecting out th e eye of an ox an d observing th e inverte d imag e forme d o n th e retina . H e wa s als o aware of the importanc e o f nerve impulses in mediating actions an d gave a purely mechanisti c accoun t o f how reflexe s work .

hand. A limb perceive d a s thoug h stil l present afte r amputatio n is known as a phantom limb. Descartes concluded that the "pain in the hand is not fel t by the mind inasmuch as it is in the hand, but a s it is in th e brain. " Th e phantom lim b shows , in othe r words , tha t con scious perception depend s o n events in the brain rathe r tha n on the sensory input itself .
Such observations le d Descartes to a mechanistic view of the func tioning o f the brain . Suc h a vie w i s take n fo r grante d i n muc h of modern neuroscience , bu t i n Descartes' time it was a revolutionary doctrine. I t wa s als o a dangerou s one , since it threatene d th e ide a that human s wer e differen t fro m th e animals . However, Descartes was pruden t enoug h t o mak e a n exceptio n of the huma n mind . He accepted a mechanisti c accoun t o f the behavio r o f animals an d o f human reflexe s bu t considere d tha t huma n rationalit y was o n a different plane . Influenced agai n by mechanical toys, he argued that
a perfect mechanical replica of an ape would in fact be indistinguish-
able from a real ape, but that no such replica of a human being could be mistaken for a real human .
In particular, ther e wer e tw o tests that the human replica would fail. First , a mechanica l replic a woul d be incapable of the creative use o f language enjoye d even by "me n o f the lowes t grade o f intellect." Second, and mor e generally , the replica coul d do only what it was constructe d t o do , and woul d lack the human flexibilit y t o respond intelligently to novel or unexpected situations. Human reason and will , Descartes seemed t o say, transcend th e workings of a mere mechanical device .
These arguments hav e a remarkably contemporary ring to them. Modern researc h o n th e abilit y o f ape s an d othe r animal s t o us e language ha s focuse d o n th e crucia l questio n o f whether tha t lan guage ha s th e creativit y an d flexibilit y o f human language . Moreover, ou r moder n ag e i s als o obsesse d wit h mechanica l devices —
computers an d robots—that simulate human thought or action, and the questio n agai n i s whether th e simulatin g device can be said t o duplicate the human min d or human consciousness. It is sometimes said, for instance, tha t computers wil l never truly simulate the human min d because a computer ca n onl y do what i t is programmed to do , an d s o cannot mimi c th e creativit y and flexibilit y tha t hu mans possess . This was exactl y the poin t tha t Descarte s was making, althoug h h e wa s not , o f course , abl e t o dres s i t i n compute r jargon.
Since the human mind could not be reduced to mechanical principles, Descartes argued that humans must possess a nonmaterial soul that set s u s apar t fro m th e othe r animals. The distinction between the nonmaterial min d an d th e physical brain and bod y is known as

Are Humans Unique? 9
mind-body dualism. Descarte s suggeste d tha t th e sou l could influ ence th e working s o f th e brai n throug h th e pinea l gland , a smal l structure tha t h e though t importan t becaus e o f its locatio n on th e midline of the brain, just behind the forehead and roughly between the eyebrows. It was through th e pineal gland that the soul received sensations and initiate d voluntary action. So it is, according to Descartes, tha t humans , an d onl y humans, posses s consciousnes s an d free will.
This may have been the most exalted status to have been achieved by th e pinea l gland—it s finest hour , so to speak—although certain sects stil l hol d tha t i t possesse s specia l powers . I n theosoph y an d some Easter n religion s i t i s know n a s th e "thir d eye, " and som e parapsychologists stil l believe that it may be responsible for telepathy an d othe r extrasensor y powers . Nevertheless , Descartes' ide a was greete d wit h skepticis m eve n by his own contemporaries, an d few no w give it any credence whatever.
There have been other attempts to find some anatomical basis for human uniquenes s an d throug h whic h the sou l might find expression. The nineteenth-century anatomist Richar d Owen, for instance, maintained tha t certai n brai n structures , includin g th e hippo campus minor , were presen t onl y in humans an d wer e responsible for our special status. However, Thomas Henry Huxley, Charles Darwin's grea t frien d an d protagonist , showe d conclusivel y that al l apes posses s thes e structures . A s a consequenc e of the debat e be tween Huxle y and Owen , the hippocampu s was th e objec t of some befuddled ridicul e among their contemporaries. In The Water Babies (1886), Charles Kingsley satirized Huxley and, incidentally, touched again on themes introduced by Descartes, as follows:
You ma y thin k tha t ther e ar e othe r mor e importan t difference s be tween yo u an d a n ape , suc h a s bein g abl e t o speak , an d mak e ma chines, and kno w right fro m wrong, and sa y your prayers, an d othe r little matters of that kind; but tha t is a child's fancy, my dear. Nothing is to be depended o n but th e great hippopotamus [sic] test. 12
The hippocampus mino r seems to have gone the way of the pineal gland, but the structure known simply as the hippocampus has often been implicated in modern theories of consciousness. This structure can b e identifie d i n lowe r mammal s a s wel l as i n primates, bu t i s absent i n birds , whic h ha s le d t o th e frivolou s suggestio n that it s purpose i n animal s ma y b e t o preven t flight. It i s stil l i n fac t th e focus of considerable controversy and ha s been implicated in a number of mental functions, including conscious memory, the representation of space, and emotio n and anxiety . Ironically, the ver y similar-

ity of its function i n humans and other apes might be taken to imply that consciousnes s i s not unique to humans.13
Another modern ide a i s that th e anatomica l basi s fo r a uniquely human consciousnes s migh t b e foun d i n th e lef t sid e o f the huma n brain, whic h appear s t o posses s propertie s no t foun d i n th e lef t brains o f othe r mammals . Thes e includ e a specializatio n fo r lan guage, itsel f ofte n take n t o b e a hallmar k o f huma n uniqueness . Some hav e argue d tha t th e lef t hemispher e o f the huma n brai n i s also endowe d wit h specia l qualitie s o f consciousnes s tha t se t u s apart fro m othe r species . A s the titl e of this boo k indicates , these themes ar e centra l t o m y concern s an d wil l b e discusse d i n mor e detail in later chapters.
Descartes' dualisti c view, in which the nonmateria l soul was distinguished fro m th e materia l brain , wa s somethin g o f a maste r stroke, for it appease d religiou s opinion while keeping the stud y of the brai n and nervou s syste m saf e for future generation s of scientists. Nevertheless, even at th e time , there wer e those who doubted its plausibility . One was th e youn g Princes s Elizabet h o f Palatine, cousin of King Charles II of England who founded the Royal Society. Elizabeth di d no t se e how a nonmateria l entity , withou t physical properties o r extension in space, could possibly influence th e material brain , an d sh e had som e correspondenc e wit h Descartes abou t this. Nevertheless , Elizabeth ma y hav e bee n awar e that , theologically, she was venturing into forbidden territory, and asked that he r letters t o Descarte s b e destroyed . Fortunately , they wer e not , bu t some were not recovered unti l some 200 years later.
In th e eighteent h century , Descartes ' compatrio t J . O . d e L a Mettrie, in his boo k L'Homme Machine (1747), 14 di d tak e the fatefu l step of arguing tha t "irritation " of the nerve s would explain all behavior, whether anima l o r human , reflexiv e o r intelligent . For this heresy he was attacked b y the clergy and banished from Franc e and later fro m Holland , t o find refuge ultimatel y in the cour t of Frederick the Grea t o f Prussia. Howeve r doubt s abou t Cartesia n dualism and the dichotomy between humans and other animals were probably quite widespread, if suppressed.

Darwin and Continuity
If Descarte s lai d th e moder n foundation s for a dichotomy between humans and other animals, it was Charles Darwin who set the stage for continuity . The publicatio n in 185 9 of hi s famou s treatis e The Origin of Species pose d a serious threat t o notions of human uniqueness, and the repercussions are still with us.

The idea tha t human s evolve d from othe r animal s was itsel f no t new, although i t was generally regarde d i n Darwin's time as heretical. A s earl y a s th e sixt h centur y B.C. , the Gree k philosophe r Anaximander argue d tha t al l animals , including humans, were descended from fishes. Perhaps evolutio n was in Darwin's genes, since his own grandfather, Erasmu s Darwin, had speculate d that the different form s o f lif e develope d graduall y fro m a commo n ancestry. The Frenc h natura l historian s Buffo n (1701-1788 ) an d Cuvie r (1769-1832) wer e als o importan t influences ; Darwi n remarked of Buffon's ten-volum e work , Natural History, tha t "whol e page s ar e laughably lik e mine." 15 Although he argue d tha t ne w specie s de scended fro m ol d ones , an d tha t human s an d ape s mus t shar e a common ancestor , Buffo n wa s force d by the religious authorities to declare tha t hi s view s did no t contradic t th e biblica l story o f creation. Jea n Baptist e Pierr e Antoin e de Monnet , Chevalier de La marck (1744-1829) , otherwis e know n a s Lamarck , a prominen t French zoologis t an d a precurso r o f Darwin, also argue d fo r evolution, but hel d tha t evolutionar y change was brought abou t i n part through th e inheritanc e o f characteristic s acquire d a s a resul t of learning. Although revived in th e lat e 1930 s and 1940 s by th e Rus-
sian geneticis t Trofi m D . Lysenko, this theor y has neve r held sway for lon g and i s now generally discredited .
Darwin's contributio n wa s twofold . First , h e marshale d a hug e array o f facts t o suppor t th e ide a o f evolution, so tha t i t wa s n o longer possibl e t o ignor e th e likelihoo d tha t differen t organism s were linked b y common physical descent. Second, he proposed th e theory of natural selection as a simple and convincing explanation of ho w evolutionar y change s occurred . Organism s vary, and thos e variations tha t are favore d by the environment, so the theor y goes, will tend to survive and propagate. Evolution works, in other words,
through th e survival of the fittest . The theory of natural selectio n is in a way more heretical than the
idea o f evolution itself, because i t implies that evolutionar y change is withou t directio n o r purpose . Som e theologians , fo r instance , were able to reconcile themselve s t o evolution by supposing that i t leads t o increasin g perfection , with human s just a step awa y fro m the angels. But the idea that evolution is just nature's way of capitalizing o n chanc e variation s seem s t o borde r o n th e insulting , especially if applied t o the evolution of humans. We are the product, not of divine creation, but o f historical accident .
Darwin kne w tha t hi s theor y wa s likel y to caus e trouble , espe cially insofa r a s i t implie d tha t human s wer e descende d from th e apes. In The Origin of Species h e largely avoided the issue , venturing only that "ligh t will be thrown on the origin of man an d his history."

Later, in Descent of Man (1871 ) and Th e Expression o f the Emotions in
Man and Animals (1872) , he was more explicit. He was adamant that humans di d no t diffe r fro m other animals i n kind, while conceding
an immense difference i n degree of mental powers. Yet he was somewhat equivocal , an d i n Descent of Man h e wa s pruden t enoug h t o include references to God:

The belief in God has often bee n advanced as not only the greatest, but the most complet e of all th e distinctions between man an d th e lower animals. I t i s however impossibl e ... t o maintai n that thi s belief i s innate o r instinctiv e i n man . O n th e othe r han d a belie f i n all pervading spiritua l agencie s seem s t o b e universal , and apparentl y follows fro m a considerable advance in man's reason, and fro m a still greater advanc e in his faculties of imagination, curiosity, and wonder. I am awar e tha t th e assume d instinctiv e belief i n God has been used by man y persons as an argumen t for His existence. But this is a rash argument, as we should b e thus compelled to believe in the existence of many cruel and malignan t spirits, only a little more powerful tha n man; fo r th e belie f i n the m i s far mor e general than i n a beneficen t
Deity. The idea of a universal and beneficen t Creato r does not seem to arise in the mind of man, until he has been elevated by long-continued culture.16

Another heretical aspec t of the theory of evolution was its implied materialism. If humans are descende d fro m animals , then it is diffi cult to sustain Descartes ' vie w that humans uniquely possess a nonmaterial min d o r soul . A youthful experienc e ha d warne d Darwi n that he was on dangerous ground here. While he was an undergraduate i n Edinburgh , hi s frien d W . A. Browne ha d presente d a pape r giving a materialistic interpretatio n o f life an d min d to the Plinian Society. This was so controversial that it was decided t o remove all references t o the paper, includin g its announcement in the minutes of the previous meeting.
Darwin refrained from public comment on the materialistic implications o f evolution, but i n one of his notebooks he questioned why the idea that thought was a product o f the brain should be more t o be wondered a t tha n th e idea tha t gravity was a property of matter. A. R. Wallace, who share d wit h Darwi n the credi t fo r the theor y of natural selection , could not accep t a materialistic interpretatio n of the huma n mind . He maintained tha t consciousnes s wa s uniquely human, a divine gift rathe r than the product o f evolution.
It is instructive t o consider how Wallace reached thi s opinion, for it wa s base d no t o n religious sentiment but o n a logica l argument. He observe d tha t peopl e o f differen t race s varie d widel y in thei r

quality o f lif e an d intellect . In thi s h e ma y b e accuse d o f cultural chauvinism, but no t of racism, for he also believed that the brains of "savages" were a s develope d a s thos e o f the "civilized " Europeans. He based thi s conclusion, at leas t in part, on that distinctive human faculty tha t is so often the focus of arguments about human uniqueness, namely, language:

Among th e lowes t savage s wit h th e leas t copiou s vocabularie s th e capacity o f utterin g a variet y o f distinc t articulat e sounds , an d o f applying to them an almost infinite amoun t of modulation and inflec tion, is not i n any wa y inferior to that of the higher races.17

Wallace wa s als o a rigi d selectionis t i n tha t h e believe d tha t al l evolutionary change wa s due to natural selection . However, this led to th e parado x tha t peopl e i n primitiv e societie s use d onl y a tin y part of their intellectual and cultura l potential. Plainly, this poten tial coul d no t hav e bee n th e outcom e o f natural selection , since i t was not in fact used. Wallace therefore concluded that human develodipvmineentinmteulslitgheanvcee..1b8een guided not by natural selection but by some
Darwin himself was appalled b y this argument and wrote to Wallace: "I hope you have not murdered to o completely your own child and mine." 19 He recognize d tha t no t al l evolutionar y change i s th e immediate resul t o f natural selection , and tha t feature s that hav e evolved for one purpose ar e ofte n exploited for other quit e differen t purposes. I t i s difficult t o make any sense of human evolution without supposin g tha t thi s i s tru e o f th e huma n brain . Tha t is , ou r powers o f thought an d reasonin g ma y wel l have evolved in specific contexts, suc h a s th e us e o r manufactur e o f tools , bu t hav e bee n readily adapte d t o quit e differen t activities , lik e playin g chess o r arguing abou t evolution . I n moder n evolutionar y theor y thi s i s known as exaptation, and it is now thought to play at least as important a rol e i n evolutionar y chang e a s adaptation i n the Darwinia n sense.20
It i s also becomin g apparen t tha t th e genes can undergo sudden , quite dramatic changes in structure. One way in which this occurs is through th e influence of viruses. Viral infection ca n result i n genetic material bein g transferred , o r transduced, even fro m on e species to another; fo r example, it has been suggested that developmen t of the eye in the squid and i n vertebrates was not a matter of independent, parallel evolution , bu t wa s actuall y a consequenc e o f vira l transduction—the "smuggling " of whole genes across species. 21 It is difficult t o thin k benignly of viral infections, whic h are notoriously

However i t i s no w clear , especiall y fro m th e pioneerin g wor k of Nobel Prize winner Barbara McClintock, that wholesal e changes in genetic structure ma y be brought abou t b y mechanisms othe r tha n viral transduction. So-calle d jumping genes, transposons, an d chromosomal rearrangement s ca n als o resul t i n sudde n an d dramati c changes i n geneti c structure. .22 On e consequenc e o f thi s i s tha t a change ma y be larger than tha t whic h is subsequently selecte d for. Genes lying close on the DNA string t o a change that proves to have
survival value may also be selected in terms of their sheer proximity. This has bee n terme d genetic hitch-hiking.23 Such gene s are merel y selected, rathe r tha n selecte d for—they hav e hitchhike d thei r wa y into destiny . Sinc e th e positionin g o f gene s alon g a chromosom e may bea r n o relatio n t o function , th e mechanis m o f hitchhikin g adds considerabl y t o th e randomnes s an d serendipit y of evolution.
These newl y discovere d mechanism s impl y tha t evolutio n need not be the slow, smooth proces s tha t Darwi n envisaged. Rather, evolutionary change ca n occur i n what ha s been called punctuate fash ion24 an d ca n includ e characteristic s tha t wer e no t themselve s selected in terms of survival value. It has been suggested, for example, that th e organ s o f fligh t i n insect s wer e originall y selecte d fo r a s organs o f therma l exchange , bu t i t wa s th e hitchhikin g of othe r genes tha t serendipitousl y bestowe d thei r upliftin g properties. 25 Given example s suc h a s this , i t become s no t unreasonabl e t o sup pose tha t simila r mechanism s ma y hav e produce d a discontinuity between human s an d othe r animals . Indeed , th e extr a bu t ofte n unexploited huma n potentia l tha t s o puzzle d Wallac e ma y hav e been bestowed no t by God but b y a hitchhiking gene.
Religious opposition t o th e Darwinia n theory o f evolution has, of course, persisted. I n 1860 , the year following publication of The Origin of Species, the famou s debate betwee n T. H.

Theologians, too, have tried to reconcile evolution with religious doctrine ; as the American poet William Carruth Herber t (1859-1924 ) wrote , "Som e cal l i t Evolution , And others cal l it God."

His ideas wer e largely suppresse d b y th e churc h durin g hi s lifetim e bu t gaine d considerable influenc e with the posthumous publicatio n of his book The Phenomenon o f Man in 1959 . Teilhard argued tha t evolution was characterized b y th e progressiv e dominanc e o f spirit ove r matter , culminating in human consciousness. H e saw the earth as consisting of four concentri c layers—th e lithosphere, th e atmosphere , th e biosphere, an d th e noosphere—th e las t bein g Teilhard' s ter m fo r th e outermost laye r representin g th e psychic component.

This point is called Omega :

The en d o f th e world : th e overthro w o f equilibrium, detachin g th e mind, fulfille d a t last , from it s materia l matrix , so that i t will henceforth res t with all its weight on God-Omega.26

defense of Darwinian theory against reactionary forces, seems nevertheless to accept a fundamental discontinuity between humans and other animals :

We are but a tiny twig on a tree that includes at least a million species of animals, but ou r one great evolutionar y invention , consciousness— a natura l produc t o f evolution integrated with a bodil y frame o f no special merit—ha s transformed the surfac e o f our planet. Gaze upon the land from a n airplane window. Has any other species left s o many visible signs of its relentless presence?29

In his reference to "a bodily frame of no special merit," Gould seems almost t o accep t a nonmateria l basi s fo r consciousness . I d o no t suppose tha t h e woul d wan t t o clai m that , bu t th e passag e doe s serve t o illustrat e ho w thoroughl y w e ar e steepe d i n mind-body dualism.
But a s w e hav e see n th e ide a tha t consciousnes s migh t hav e a purely mechanisti c basi s wa s recognize d b y Darwi n himsel f an d goes back at leas t t o la Mettrie. Following publication of The Origin of Species, in fact, it becam e commonplac e amon g scientists to emphasize th e objective rather than th e subjective nature of mind an d consciousness. On e enthusiasti c evolutionis t an d materialis t wa s the eminen t Frenc h physicia n an d anthropologis t Pau l Broca , wh o said tha t he would "rather be a transformed ape than a degenerate son o f Adam."30
Broca is chiefly remembered for his discovery tha t a small regio n in the lef t fronta l lobe of the huma n brain , now generally known as Broca's area, i s o f critica l importanc e i n th e contro l o f articulat e speech. Th e remarkable thin g abou t thi s discovery was tha t i t implied a n asymmetr y o f functio n in a n orga n tha t appeare d t o b e anatomically symmetrical. Thi s discrepancy between function an d structure carrie s the implicit idea of some nonmaterial intervention in the lef t sid e of the brain—the pineal gland relocated—which may explain why cerebral functiona l asymmetry has been regarded wit h fascination fo r over a century. Broca himsel f remained a convinced and articulat e materialist , however , an d lik e Socrate s wa s de nounced fo r his heretical idea s and fo r the corruption of youth.
Many biologists als o adopte d a n objectiv e approach t o the study of th e mind . In hi s boo k Mental Evolution i n Animals, publishe d in 1888, th e Britis h biologis t Georg e John Romane s wrot e as follows :

Now throughou t th e presen t wor k we shal l hav e to consider Mind a s an object ; an d therefor e it i s well t o remembe r that our onl y instrument o f analysis is th e observatio n of activities whic h w e infe r t o b e

To Romanes , th e essenc e o f consciousnes s wa s th e abilit y t o choose an d t o modif y choic e i n th e ligh t o f experience . By thes e criteria, human s ar e scarcel y special , an d visit s to an y numbe r of modern laboratorie s will reveal rats, pigeons, insects, and even planaria makin g and learning choices. Romanes nevertheless felt qualified t o construc t a n evolutionar y tre e o f intellectual development. He identified some 50 levels, but only humans reached th e top. Their nearest rivals , the apes and dogs , reached onl y to level 28, followed closely by monkeys and elephant s a t leve l 27. Through infanc y an d
childhood, humans progresse d throug h th e various levels, so that a 12-week-old human, fo r instance , is at th e leve l of a full-grow n fis h or frog.
Another influentia l figur e o f th e lat e nineteent h centur y wa s Conwy Lloyd Morgan, whose 189 4 book Introduction t o Comparative Psychology als o presente d th e cas e fo r a n objectiv e study o f con sciousness i n animals . Morga n i s famou s fo r hi s so-calle d cano n governing the interpretatio n o f the behavior of nonhuman animals :

In no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of a higher psychical activity, if it can be interpreted as the outcome of one which stands lower in the psychological scale.32

But while this admirable doctrin e ma y prevent excesses in attributing intelligence to animals, i t may equally (and conveniently) serve to widen artificially the gap between ourselves and our animal cousins, and s o preserve ou r sens e of superiority.
Despite their objectiv e approaches, Romanes , Morgan, and othe r biologists o f the tim e stil l regarde d ou r huma n knowledg e of ou r own minds as crucial to the exercise of attributing consciousness to animals.

Behaviorism and the Denia l of Mind Things changed radically wit h the behaviorists, who emerged as the dominant force in North American psychology in the first half of the twentieth century. The father of behaviorism was John Broadus Watson, and i n a famous article published i n 191 3 he wrote:

Psychology, a s th e behavioris t view s it , i s a purel y experimenta l branch o f natural science . Its experimental goal i s the prediction and control o f behavior. Introspectio n form s n o essential part o f its methods, nor is the scientific value of its data dependent upon the reading s with whic h the y len d themselve s t o interpretatio n i n term s o f consciousness. Th e behaviorist , i n hi s effort s t o ge t a unitar y schem e of animal response , recognize s n o dividin g lin e betwee n ma n an d brutes.34

Watson's cred o le d hi m t o som e farfetche d an d indee d unneces sary contortions, suc h a s the idea tha t thinking could be reduced t o subvocal movement s o f the larynx , but i n th e hand s o f later expo nents, principall y B .

I t i s stil l wit h us , nowaday s mor e i n applie d tha n i n mainstream psychology , although it s purifying (no t to say puritanical) influenc e ca n b e see n eve n i n suc h esoteri c area s a s artificia l intelligence.
The dominance o f behaviorism was such that, in North America at least, generations o f students have been taught general principles of behavior based o n experiments wit h rats and pigeons. The implication is that these principles apply equally to humans, and they have been carried , no t withou t success , int o huma n environments , suc h as the classroom o r the therapy session , and even to society at large , as in Skinner's Utopian novel Walden Two. The behaviorists did thei r best t o ri d psycholog y o f all mentalisti c terms , suc h a s mind, consciousness, an d will, an d eve n today , discussio n o f such matter s i s often furtive .
Yet behavioris m ma y hav e forfeite d som e influence , a t leas t within biology , precisely becaus e i t minimize d th e difference s be tween animal s an d becaus e i t emphasized learnin g rathe r than in stinct.

But man y ethologist s retaine d an appreciatio n o f the menta l componen t an d wer e guide d b y a t least an informal reference to their own subjective states. It is ironic that behavioral psychologist s should have tried so hard to eradicate the mind, while ethologists, whose main concern has been with animals, should hav e retained it .

The Cognitive Revolutio n
Over the las t quarte r of a century, the influenc e o f behaviorism ha s waned, and i t is no longer the dominan t force i n psychology. Among ethologists, too , th e objectivis t movement ha s los t som e o f its mo mentum, an d ther e i s growin g interes t i n th e natur e o f consciousness i n animals . Perhap s th e reaso n fo r thi s shif t wa s simpl y tha t rigid behaviorist and objectivist doctrines seemed t o rob psychology and biolog y o f muc h o f thei r interes t an d relevance . Ther e were , however, som e othe r identifiabl e influence s a t work , althoug h whether the y were the causes of change or the effects o f some deeper shift i n the Zeitgeist is a matter for debate .
Chomsky and the Linguisti c Revolutio n One influential figure was the linguist Noam Chomsky, whose rather obscure an d seemingl y innocuou s boo k Syntactic Structures, pub lished i n 1957 , led t o a revolutio n i n ou r conception s o f language. Coincidentally, 195 7 was als o th e yea r i n whic h B.F . Skinner pub lished hi s boo k Verbal Behavior, a n ambitiou s attemp t t o reduc e language to behaviorist principles. Two more different book s on language ca n scarcel y b e imagined . Matter s cam e t o a hea d i n 1959 , when Chomsky wrote a blistering review of Skinner's book .
Since languag e feature s s o insistentl y i n discussion s o f huma n uniqueness, I have devote d a whol e chapte r (Chapte r 5) to it , an d Chomsky's ideas on language will be discussed i n some detail there . For the present , i t i s sufficien t t o not e tha t Chomsk y effectively re vived a Cartesian view of language as a uniquely human skill characterized b y unlimited variet y an d flexibility . The unbounded nature of language was such tha t i t could not be reduced t o simple associations, linked throug h reinforcemen t (reward s an d punishments) , as Skinner had argued.
In th e wak e of Chomsky's trenchant critique , many psychologists adopted a Chomskia n perspective on languag e rather tha n a Skin nerian one, and a new discipline called psycholinguistics wa s born. A

Computers an d Artificial intelligenc e Another influenc e i n th e declin e o f behaviorism wa s th e development of the digital computer, whic h provided an obvious metaphor for th e human mind . Much of psychology has depended on the availability of suitable mechanical metaphors ; i t has always proven diffi cult to think about thinkin g without likening it to some mechanical device. Descartes , fo r instance , adopte d a hydrauli c model , an d when thi s wa s abandoned , th e Voltaic pile was for a time in vogue. The developmen t o f railroads , wit h switchin g mechanisms , pro vided another convenien t metaphor, an d idea s base d o n telegraphy (such a s "circuits" and "rela y stations" ) are still prominent. Bu t the computer seeme d s o obviousl y capable o f mimicking mental pro cesses that scientists deliberately set about programming it to do so. So th e scienc e o f artificia l intelligenc e wa s born , an d computer s began t o play chess, simulate huma n reasoning and expertise, write poetry and music, and provide psychotherapy.
The development o f artificial intelligenc e was strongly influential in th e growt h o f so-called cognitiv e psychology, which fo r the pas t two decades, a t least , has supplanted behavioris m as the dominant influence in academic psychology. Cognitive psychologists freely borrow compute r terminolog y i n constructin g theorie s o f th e mind , using concept s lik e storage , retrieval , scanning , filtering , coding , and transformation, i n computer-based flo w diagram s tha t ar e supposed t o model th e way the mind processes information.
Some enthusiast s hav e argued tha t computers ca n not only simu-
late th e mind , the y can als o b e said possess minds . That is , a computer i n the process of playing chess or giving therapy ma y be said to actually b e conscious. Needles s to say, such claims also strik e a t the root s o f our belief s about huma n uniquenes s an d hav e le d t o considerable debate. .36 Althoug h again haunted b y the ghost o f Descartes, the debate may still be premature, because for all their apparent sophistication, computer s ar e still a very long way from master ing eve n th e mos t elementar y processe s o f the huma n mind . They have grea t difficult y wit h suc h apparentl y simpl e task s a s under standing ordinar y sentences , o r perceivin g ordinar y visua l scenes , or even picking out the individual words from a sentence spoken in a normal voice. This, of course, says rather little for the level of mental processing require d i n ches s o r psychotherapy , where simulation has been reasonably successful .

As Sherry Turkle , in he r boo k Th e Second Self (1984) , put s it : "Where we once were rational animals , now we are feeling comput ers, emotional machines." 37 This leaves our sens e of human unique-
ness poised uneasily at th e intersection of the worlds of animals and computers, combining the feelings of the one with th e reason of the other.
Although th e cognitiv e revolution ended th e rule of behaviorism, subtle influence s remain . Cognitiv e psycholog y remain s fairl y strictly materialistic , a s evidence d b y th e profusio n of computerbased terms ; mentalisti c term s ar e stil l largely avoided. Moreover, in artificia l intelligence, the tes t of whether a simulation is successful i s an essentiall y behavioral one . This is the so-called Turing test, named afte r th e eminen t Britis h mathematicia n A . M. Turing, although again , th e basi c ide a ma y b e said t o belong to Descartes.38 Imagine a wall, behind which is a person, as well as a simulation of that person . Imagin e als o tha t i t i s possible to communicate wit h both of them b y means, say, of a keyboard and a visual display unit. Your job i s to tr y t o find out whic h i s the perso n an d whic h i s th e simulation b y asking appropriate question s and evaluatin g the answers. If you cannot tel l which is which, then the simulation passes the test.

Continuity Reasserted
Although the cognitive revolution revived Cartesian ideas of human uniqueness, there are nevertheless forces in modern science and philosophy tha t ten d t o reassert th e ide a o f continuity. One of these is the remarkable growt h in recent years of neuroscience, a multidisciplinary field to d o with th e stud y o f the brai n and th e nervou s system.

The Growth of Neuropsycholog y In the lat e nineteent h an d early twentiet h centuries, there was considerable interes t i n brai n functio n an d it s relatio n t o menta l pro cesses. Thi s was du e i n part t o the observation s of Paul Broca an d others o n the area s of the brai n involve d in language—this will be reviewed i n Chapte r 7 . Anothe r influentia l figur e wa s th e Britis h neurologist Joh n Hughlings Jackson, wh o foreshadowed th e importance o f the righ t sid e o f the brai n i n nonverba l menta l processes . Yet for a long time this work had curiousl y little impact o n psychology. Thi s wa s du e a t leas t i n par t t o th e narrowin g influenc e of behaviorism. Fo r al l it s materialism , behavioris m seeme d t o deny
not only the mind but als o the brain . Things bega n t o chang e afte r Worl d War II . An important influ -
ence was th e publicatio n i n 194 9 of Organization of Behavior by th e Canadian psychologis t Donal d O . Hebb , whos e idea s stemme d i n turn fro m hi s work wit h Kar l S . Lashley. Hebb's book was a largely speculative account o f how learning, perception, and thinking might be explained i n neurophysiological terms . As such, it represented a thoroughly materialistic approac h t o the mind.
Two other prominent figure s o f the tim e helped revive interest i n the psychologica l implication s of brain impairments . Alexande r R. Luria i n th e Sovie t Unio n an d Hans-Luka s Teube r i n th e Unite d States. Betwee n them , Hebb , Luria , an d Teube r ma y b e regarde d as th e foundin g father s o f th e ne w disciplin e of neuropsychology. Two early converts , Olive r Zangwill in England an d Henr i Hecae n in France , helpe d establis h neuropsycholog y a s a n internationa l discipline.
An especiall y influentia l developmen t i n neuropsycholog y too k place in the 1960 s when two neurosurgeons i n Los Angeles, Philip J. Vogel and Josep h E . Bogen, decided to sever the main commissures , or fibe r tracts , connectin g th e tw o side s o f the brai n i n a serie s of patients sufferin g fro m intractabl e epilepsy . By "splitting the brain " in thi s fashion , the y argued , i t shoul d b e possibl e t o preven t th e spread of epileptic seizure s originatin g on one side.

series le d t o dramati c discoveries , wit h profoun d implications for the relations between mind and brain.
By mean s o f subtle techniques , which will b e describe d i n mor e detail in Chapter 7, it is possible to restrict inpu t to one or the other
cerebral hemisphere of a split-brained patient, and so to assess separately each hemisphere's mental capacities. The pioneering work on the split-braine d patient s wa s performe d mainl y b y Roge r W . Sperry, who received the Nobel Prize for his discoveries in 1981. This work confirmed that the lef t cerebra l hemispher e was dominant for language, and also showed that the right hemisphere was capable of understanding language but no t of producing speech. As anticipated by th e eminen t Britis h neurologis t Joh n Hughling s Jackson , th e right hemisphere also proved superior t o the left i n some nonverbal skills, including those involved in spatial perception.40
Perhaps th e mos t intriguin g aspec t o f the split-braine d patien t was the apparentl y independent mental lif e enjoye d by each hemisphere. Eac h remaine d obliviou s t o informatio n presente d t o th e other, an d i t wa s possibl e t o arrang e fo r th e tw o hemisphere s t o perform conflictin g task s simultaneously , each operatin g wit h th e opposite hand—th e lef t han d kne w no t wha t th e righ t han d wa s doing. Later observations suggested that the two hemispheres could even posses s rathe r differen t personalities , no t alway s in harmony with on e another. As we shall see in Chapter 10 , these observations revived the idea, popular i n the latter part of the nineteenth century, that ther e ar e tw o minds in the on e brain. Indeed, it i s part o f our contemporary folklor e tha t th e lef t hemispher e represent s th e ra tional, analyti c aspec t o f our consciousness , whil e the righ t hemisphere represents th e intuitive, holistic aspect.
Whether o r no t th e notio n o f a "dua l mind " can b e extended to those of us wit h normal , intac t brains , the separat e menta l live s of the tw o cerebra l hemisphere s o f th e split-braine d patien t hav e some implication s fo r th e understandin g o f consciousness . Th e split min d of the split-braine d patient suggest s a material basis for consciousness—the mind cannot travers e the physical gap between the separated hemispheres . Yet Sperry himself , the presiding architect o f the split-brai n studies , seemed t o see in the results evidence for a transcendenta l vie w o f consciousness . H e argue s tha t con sciousness i s a n emergen t propert y tha t ca n fee d bac k o n th e neurophysiological process and s o influence action.41
The split-brai n studie s ar e bu t on e exampl e o f how menta l processes may be affected b y surgery or accident to the brain. Although neuropsychology provide s fa r fro m a complet e understandin g of how menta l processe s ar e represente d i n neura l tissue , fe w

Cognitive Etholog y In 1976 , the ethologis t D . R. Griffi n publishe d The Question of Animal Awareness: Evolutionary Continuity o f Mental Experience, a second edition of which appeared i n 1981 . In some respects, this work is also part of the cognitive revolution, but i t seeks to include animals as well as humans. Griffin was opposed to the objectivist, parsimonious interpretation o f animal behavio r that had dominate d ethology (and psychology) under th e influenc e of Morgan's famous canon. He collected a great man y examples of animal behavior that appear t o provide convincing evidence of conscious thought . For instance, although tool use has been regarded a s an essentially human develop-
ment, ther e ar e i n fac t man y instance s o f animals usin g tool s i n apparently purposeful ways : Vulture s thro w stones at ostrich eggs, apparently i n order t o break them ; se a otters carr y stone s aroun d and use them a s anvils upon which to pound shellfish; an d even the lowly ant use s bits of leaf or wood as a sponge to soak up semiliquid foodstuffs s o that the y ca n b e transporte d t o thei r hom e colonies .
Much of Griffin's argumen t i s based on an analysis of communication i n animals . I n particular , h e i s concerne d wit h refutin g
Chomsky's assertio n tha t th e essentia l propertie s o f huma n lan guage are uniquely human. This matter will be treated more fully in Chapter 6.
Griffin's analysi s is essentially a commonsense one, and he is least convincing whe n h e trie s t o defin e subjectiv e terms; i n th e secon d edition o f his book , he complains o f definitions an d concept s being "quibbled to death" and place s less reliance on them. Although Grif fin advocate s a ne w fiel d tha t h e call s cognitive ethology, hi s ap proach i s actuall y littl e differen t fro m tha t of , say, Romanes, who similarly argue d tha t w e shoul d dra w o n subjectiv e experienc e in the interpretatio n o f behavioral observations . Griffi n doe s suggest, however, tha t development s i n teachin g languag e t o ape s migh t open ne w door s t o th e mind s o f other animals . Still , readers ar e advised no t t o hold thei r breath s while waiting for this to happen .
It i s interesting t o not e th e changin g role o f consciousness i n th e question o f human uniqueness . S o long a s consciousnes s wa s con ceived as subjective, and presumably involvin g a nonmaterial component, it seemed to serve as a criterion for distinguishing ourselves from th e other animals. But as objective ways of studying conscious processes ar e developed , it appear s mor e an d mor e reasonabl e t o suppose that consciousness is something that is possessed by at least some other animals besides ourselves.

Sociobiology The publication of Edward O. Wilson's book Sociobiology i n 197 5 led to furthe r attempt s t o reduc e th e behavio r o f humans an d othe r animals to common principles. This book extends the application of evolutionary principles to the socia l behavior of animals. Most of it consists of carefully an d extensively documented evidence from nonhuman animals , includin g insects . Th e fina l chapter , however , is titled "From Sociobiolog y to Sociology" and is a speculative account of th e supposedl y geneti c basis o f human socia l behavior. This, the most controversia l aspec t o f Sociobiology, was expande d by Wilson in 197 8 with the publication of his book On Human Nature.
Wilson propose d tha t suc h huma n trait s a s aggression, xenophobia, social stratification, and eve n gender differences i n behavior or ability were under genetic control. He argued that Darwinian theory would transform th e human and social sciences just as it had earlier transformed muc h of biology. The implicit materialism , determin ism, and continuity between humans and other species again awak-
ened hostility , prompted i n part n o doub t b y th e challeng e to ou r own uniqueness and self-determination. This time, protest came not so much fro m a religious establishmen t a s fro m thos e who saw sociobiology as a threat t o liberal ideals. As Stephen Jay Gould notes, biological determinism i s too often invoke d in order to preserve th e status quo , b e i t th e existenc e o f a rulin g clas s o r discrimination against women.42
However, even from a strictl y scientifi c poin t o f view, Wilson undoubtedly overstate d th e case . On e sociobiologica l strateg y i s t o seek precursors of human behavio r among "lower" animals, as evidence that thes e behaviors are a product o f biological evolution. For instance, mal e mallar d duck s appea r t o forc e female s t o copulat e with them , suggestin g a biologica l basis fo r human rape . Th e risk
here i s that o f confusing analogy wit h homology . For instance, th e wings of birds and insect s evolved quite independently of each other (the common ancestor of the two groups di d not possess wings ) and are therefor e analogie s rathe r tha n homologies . Similarly, it i s extremely unlikel y tha t force d copulatio n i n mallard s an d huma n rape, whic h i s surely a pathologica l behavio r that ha s littl e t o do with sex or procreation, hav e a common genetic origin.43
In fact, i n dealing with human behavior , it is very difficult indee d to distinguis h cultura l influence s from biologica l o r geneti c ones . We are a slow-breeding species—slow, that is , relative to the pace of technological chang e an d o f the adaptationa l demand s i t place s on us—and w e d o no t permi t geneti c experiment s upo n ourselves . Moreover, cultural evolution, in which behavioral patterns are transmitted throug h instructio n o r imitation , ofte n mimic s biological

evolution; both , afte r all , hav e t o d o wit h adaptation . Give n th e human capacit y fo r language an d flexibl e communication , cultural transmission i s th e mor e rapi d an d efficien t mean s o f adaptation, and th e odd s mus t favo r i t ove r geneti c transmissio n a s th e likel y source of most distinctivel y human behaviors .
More recently, Charle s L. Lumsden an d Wilson, in their 198 3 book Promethean Fire: Reflections o n th e Origin of Mind, have argued for a compromise i n term s o f wha t the y cal l gene-culture coevolution.44 There ar e tw o sides t o this thesis . First , human gene s influence th e structure o f the huma n mind , which i n turn influence s th e cultures we live in. Second, cultur e influence s our behavior, and so can exert a selectiv e influence o n th e genes . Thi s couplin g of genes an d cul ture, wit h eac h influencin g the other , wa s responsibl e fo r th e very creation o f the huma n mind . It also "drov e the growt h of the brai n and th e human intellec t forwar d a t a rat e perhap s unprecedente d for an y organ i n the histor y of life." Lumsden and Wilso n propose i n fact a "thousan d yea r rule, " whic h assert s tha t significan t geneti c changes in human evolutio n can occur i n a mere 5 0 generations, or about a thousand years .
Lumsden an d Wilso n thu s reviv e a sens e o f human uniquenes s while insistin g o n stron g geneti c influences ; the y hav e thei r cak e and ea t i t too . However , thei r boo k actually give s little evidence of the contingencies tha t migh t hav e shaped gene-cultur e coevolution as a mod e o f adaptation..45 Despit e th e earlie r promise s o f th e so ciobiologists, it seems that th e issue of whether there is a discontinuity betwee n human s an d othe r specie s i s still ver y muc h wit h us .

Perspective
In summary, the issues remain ver y much as defined by Descartes in the seventeent h century . However , opinio n a s t o whethe r human s are or are not fundamentally different fro m othe r specie s has fluctu ated. Probably th e common vie w among laypersons i s that human s are unique an d superio r t o othe r creatures , bu t thi s vie w may b e unconsciously motivated b y our shabb y treatmen t o f animals. Darwinian theory strongl y suggeste d th e heretical ide a that humans do not diffe r fundamentall y fro m othe r species , and thi s view permeated behavioristi c psychology , ethology , neuroscience , an d so ciobiology, at leas t in its earlier phase .
Nevertheless, th e cognitiv e revolution o f the pas t 3 0 years o r s o has revive d i n som e quarter s th e notio n o f human uniqueness . In particular, Chomsk y and othe r moder n linguist s have adopte d th e role of neo-Cartesians. The dominanc e of cognitive psychology over

Are Humans Unique? 27
behaviorism mean t tha t researc h o n animals gav e way to researc h on humans , an d moder n theorie s o f cognition are presente d wit h little concer n fo r ho w the y migh t appl y t o nonhumans . Humans were reinstate d a s the mai n objec t of inquiry in psychology.
It shoul d no t b e thought , however , that th e cognitiv e revolution, with it s Cartesia n overtones , i s opposed t o evolutionar y theory. As we hav e seen , moder n evolutionar y theor y differ s fro m th e tradi tional Darwinia n vie w in tha t i t allow s fo r sudden an d quit e dra matic changes i n genetic structure. Th e changes that ca n occur ca n be more extensiv e than th e changes tha t ar e actually selected for, so that evolutio n ma y hav e a serendipitou s qualit y not envisage d by Darwin. Far fro m denyin g an evolutionar y basis for the discontinuity betwee n human s an d othe r animals , neo-Cartesian s suc h a s Chomsky argue explicitl y that th e discontinuit y itself ha s a genetic basis.
For th e mos t part , too , moder n cognitiv e science eschew s Cartesian dualism , retainin g a n objectiv e approach t o th e stud y of the human mind. Whether their inclinatio n is toward th e study of brain function o r th e stud y of artificial intelligence, most cognitive scientists see k mechanisti c interpretation s o f the mind . Even consciousness, it i s implied, can b e found in the electroni c circuit s of a computer o r th e neura l circuit s o f a brain . Howeve r i t the n become s natural t o ask whether menta l phenomena, including consciousness, might als o appl y t o othe r animals . Thi s is the domai n o f cognitive ethology. Eve n th e moder n behaviorist s hav e grow n steadil y mor e "cognitive," studyin g suc h comple x behavior s a s choice , memory, and communication . Behaviorist s ar e thu s n o longer isolated fro m ethologists, o r psychologist s fro m linguists , neurologists , o r com puter scientists . Eve n philosophers ar e rejoining the action.
As cognitive science grows eve r mor e confiden t in th e framin g of objective, mechanistic theorie s o f the mind, so the subjective aspect has diminished . Our own mental processes ar e i n any event notoriously inaccessible t o introspection (o r subjective scrutiny), and even when they are apparently accessible , the information about the m is often notoriousl y fallible . Introspectio n ma y hav e som e heuristi c value, in framing hypotheses o r i n guiding interpretation of experimental findings , bu t i t no longer has any substantive role i n cognitive theory itself. With the relentless march o f progress i n the neural and behaviora l sciences , an d i n the construction o f computer-based models o f cognition, there i s little room fo r mentalistic concepts.
Our sense that we are fundamentally different fro m othe r animals is nevertheless largely a subjective one, and i s thus prey to our fears , prejudices, and nee d to justify th e way we treat animals. Moreover, reliance o n th e subjectiv e tends t o lea d u s towar d th e conclusion

that we are differen t simpl y becaus e we are we: in our own minds, we find a consciousnes s tha t belong s t o ourselves bu t doe s no t belong to the famil y ca t or dog . I t clearly will not d o to conclude fro m this that onl y humans are conscious . The family cat , feignin g slee p on the hearth, might equally conclude that only cats are conscious. As th e stud y o f mental processe s ha s bee n hijacke d fro m th e arm chair to the laboratory, so the sense of human uniqueness has diminished.

Human Evolution
The question is this: Is man a n ape or an angel? My lord, I am o n the side of the angels.
So SAI D BENJAMI N DISRAELI . I t ha s becom e clear , however, that th e rest of us surely share a common ancestry with the apes. We belong, in fact, t o the order of creatures known as primates—in th e biological rather tha n the ecclesiastical meanin g of the term. The primates, in turn, are considered th e highest order of the class known as mammals, s o called becaus e the y suckl e thei r young . Modern primate s include lemurs, monkeys, anthropoid apes , and, of course, ourselves.
It is convenient to begin the story of human evolution not with the primates themselve s bu t wit h a n extinc t species , th e dinosaur . I t might b e argued , i n fact , tha t w e owe our exalte d position on th e planet to the extinction of that exoti c creature.
From Dinosaur s to Ape s At on e time, th e dinosaur s an d thei r cousin s of the air (pterosaurs ) and sea (ichthyosaurs, plesiosaurs, mosasaurs ) were the lords of the earth, muc h a s w e human s ar e (o r thin k w e are ) today . Som e 6 5 million years ago, at the close of the period known as the Cretaceous, they al l perishe d i n on e o f several mas s extinction s known to have occurred i n the history of life. The reason for this is a matter of some controversy.

I t woul d als o hav e destroye d livin g plants , althoug h seed s would have remained dorman t fo r the later reestablishment of plant life. Thes e events would have been sufficien t t o wipe out th e herbivorous dinosaurs . I t i s also thought tha t th e dinosaurs ha d bee n in decline for some time, and the wayward asteroid migh t simply have delivered the coup de grace.1
During the reign of the dinosaurs, mammals were relatively insignificant, rat-lik e creatures, but the y survived whatever it wa s tha t destroyed th e dinosaurs . Include d amon g the m wa s a t leas t on e species of the primat e order , known as Purgatorius. The remains of this creature were discovere d i n the United States a t a place called Purgatory Hill in northeastern Montana . Dated from aroun d 6 5 million year s ago , these remain s consiste d onl y of tiny pieces of bone and a fe w teeth, 2 s o w e canno t b e a t al l sur e wha t thi s ancien t ancestor really looked like. Clearly, though, it lived in the shadow of the dinosaur . One might therefor e wonder a t th e exquisite calibration o f the cataclysmi c even t that wipe d out th e might y dinosaurs and ye t preserve d thi s unprepossessin g littl e creatur e tha t woul d eventually evolve into modern humans . Was it an ac t o f God? More likely, I think, it was anothe r exampl e of the fatefu l han d played by chance. "Our curren t existence, " writes Stephe n Ja y Gould , "is an extended function o f enormous improbabilities."3
Following th e demis e of the dinosaurs , th e mammal s cam e int o their own . Th e earlies t know n mammal s wer e i n fac t primates, 4 including Purgatorius. They emerged from th e forest floor and gradually too k t o th e trees , wher e the y proliferate d a s smal l nocturna l animals tha t live d o n insects . I n th e cours e o f evolution, various bodily feature s adapte d t o arborea l life ; fo r instance , fingers with nails replaced paw s wit h claws, and th e eyes migrated t o the fron t rather tha n the side of the head. The forelimbs were freed fro m thei r role a s weight supporter s i n standin g and movin g around, and became adept at grasping and handling objects. The opposable thumb, which allows the hand t o grasp, i s the main characteristic tha t distinguishes the primates fro m othe r mammalia n species.5 Many primate specie s becam e diurna l rathe r tha n nocturna l an d evolved color vision. By some 40 million years ago, then, at least three important characteristics o f modern humans had emerged, namely, grasping hands, stereoscopic vision , and th e ability to see in color.6
From these tree-dwelling creatures, known as prosimians, the monkeys evolved . The monkey s were large r tha n th e prosimians , an d their diet changed from insect s to plants, including leaves and fruit .

It was fro m th e remainin g colony of monkeys in the Ol d World, some 30 million years ago , that the apes evolved. These were larger, in turn, than the monkeys and were of several different types .
Remnants of prehistoric apes, datin g from th e Miocen e period of some 2 0 millio n t o 8 millio n year s ago , hav e bee n foun d i n far ranging site s i n th e Ol d World. These are know n as hominoids an d are the ancestors o f the pongids (great apes) and th e hominids, who include modern humans . Th e earliest fossi l i n the hominoid record was a specimen known as Proconsul, found in Africa an d dating from about 2 0 million years ago . This creature wa s at first thought to be an Africa n subspecie s o f anothe r creatur e know n as Dryopithecus, but th e dryopithecine s ar e no w regarde d a s a late r famil y o f apes that range d acros s Europ e an d Asi a fro m Spai n t o China. Anothe r group, including Sivapithecus an d Ramapithecus, wer e first discovered i n th e Siwali k Hill s north o f New Delhi in th e 1930s . In 1961, Louis Leakey found another Ramapithecus skul l in southern Kenya, and severa l skull remnants fro m India and Pakista n were then also classified a s belongin g t o th e sam e species . Sinc e then , trace s of Ramapithecus hav e been found i n a wide area encompassing Africa, Asia, an d souther n Europe . Unti l recently , i t wa s though t tha t Ramapithecus represente d th e lin e fro m whic h human s ar e de scended, but recent evidence suggests that it was probably the ancestor of the moder n orangutan. 7
Unfortunately, ther e i s a break i n th e fossi l record s fro m th e lat e Miocene, some 8 million years ago, until the earl y Pliocene of something under 4 million years ago. It has therefore not been possible to
reconstruct th e event s tha t le d t o th e emergenc e o f the firs t tru e hominids. As we shall see, however, it now seems likely that the split between the apes and the hominids did take place within this mysterious windo w o f time . I t als o seem s clea r tha t th e emergenc e of hominids did no t tak e place in India, Asia, or Europe, but wa s confined to Africa . Indeed , a s w e shall see , that remarkabl e continent has mor e tha n onc e bee n th e sourc e o f evolutionary change along the path t o moder n humans . Afric a i s truly the cradl e of humanity.

gorillas. Thes e astut e speculation s wer e supporte d b y subsequen t evidence. Chimpanzee s an d gorilla s liv e naturall y onl y i n Africa , and discoverie s o f the fossils of the earliest hominid s have also been confined t o Africa. Sinc e gorillas look much like enlarged chimpanzees, it has generally been assumed tha t the y split as a pair from th e human lineage , and later split from on e another t o become separat e species. However, this assumptio n ha s been challenged by evidence from molecula r biology.
In 1967 , V. M. Saric h an d A . C. Wilson published a no w classi c paper o n the molecula r similarit y between apes an d humans . They based thei r stud y o n a protein calle d albumin, o n the grounds tha t the structur e o f proteins closel y reflects the structur e o f the gene s themselves. They reached th e controversia l conclusio n that , a t th e molecular level , humans an d chimpanzee s wer e onl y about 1 percent different . Assumin g a constant rat e of mutational change, they calculated that the common ancestor of the human and the chimpanzee existed as recently as 5 million years ago. This too was a controversial claim , since at tha t tim e i t was generally assumed tha t th e split occurred muc h earlier, perhaps a s long as 20 million years ago.8
In 1984 , Charles Sible y and Jo n Ahlquist, then at Yal e University , published further evidence on the evolutionary relationships among humans, chimpanzees, an d gorilla s base d o n a technique known as DNA hybridization. 9 Thei r results suggested tha t humans an d chimpanzees forme d a pai r tha t diverge d fro m gorilla s before they diverged from each other. Sible y and Ahlquis t also estimated th e ap proximate date s a t whic h divergence s too k plac e (se e Figur e 2.1). They suggested tha t th e gibbon s split off from th e hominoid famil y tree some 16. 4 to 23 million years ago , followed b y th e orangutan s some 13. 0 to 1 6 million years ago and the n by the gorillas 8.0 to 9.9 million year s ago . Human s an d chimpanzees , the y inferred , split some tim e betwee n 6. 3 and 7. 7 millio n years ago , whic h i s somewhat earlie r tha n th e estimate tha t Saric h an d Wilson had made.10 However, it also lies within the period of the fossil voi d between the late Miocene and earl y Pliocene.
Another, mor e recen t techniqu e ha s bee n t o compar e th e actua l sequences o f bases o n DN A molecules fro m humans , chimpanzees, and gorillas . Michael Miyamoto, Jerry Slightom , and Morri s Goodman identifie d 710 0 bas e pai r sequence s i n equivalen t part s o f a beta-globin gene in each specie s and foun d th e smallest divergence, only 1. 6 percent, betwee n human s an d commo n chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes),,wit h chimpanzee s showin g a divergenc e of 2.1 percent from gorillas. 11 That is , chimpanzee s appear t o resembl e humans more than they resemble gorillas.
These conclusion s base d o n molecula r evidenc e remain some -

Whatever th e explanatio n fo r the discrepanc y betwee n th e ana tomical and geneti c evidence, there can b e little doubt of our closeness t o these othe r livin g apes, however disturbin g that ma y be to our sensibilities or to our conception s of human uniqueness. Analyses of the chromosome s o f the thre e species suggest that 1 8 of the 2 3 chromosomes o f modern human s ar e virtuall y identical to thos e of the common precursor of the orangutan, gorilla, and chimpanzee..16 The close resemblance in DNA structure between humans and chimpanzees eve n suggest s tha t a hybri d specie s woul d b e viable 17—a chastening thought. And the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees may have existed as recently as 5 million years ago, a mere eyeblink on the scale of evolutionary time.

Australopithecus In 1924 , a youn g Australian anatomist, Raymon d Dart, came int o possession of a skull like that of an immature ape in a cave at Taung, South Africa . Althoug h his colleague s wer e a t firs t skeptical , Dart hailed hi s find as th e "missin g link" between chimpanzee and hu man, an d christene d i t Australopithecus africanus. (On e wonders if the choic e o f name wa s dictate d i n par t b y the fac t tha t Dar t wa s Australian.) The brain of the Taung child was not particularly large, but it s teet h an d forehea d resemble d thos e o f a human rather tha n an ape. Moreover, the position of the foramen magnum, which is the aperture throug h whic h th e spina l cor d descend s fro m th e braincase, suggeste d a n upright , two-legge d stance. Th e specimen was dated at abou t 2 million years from th e present time.18
Other remnant s o f Australopithecus wer e discovere d i n Africa , lending further support to Dart's claim. However, matters were complicated when differen t specie s of Australopithecus were discovered, including th e "robust " for m A. robustus i n th e 1930 s and th e even more robust A. boisei in the 1950s . It is clear that differen t specie s of australopithecine coexisted , some 1. 5 to 2.5 million years ago, with perhaps th e mai n distinctio n bein g tha t betwee n th e gracile an d robust forms .

1976, when Donal d Johanso n an d hi s colleagues found th e skeleton

of a primitive female in the Afar region of Ethiopia. They named he r Lucy, afte r th e Beatles ' son g "Luc y i n th e Sk y wit h Diamonds."20

Later, however , thi s for m wa s t o b e rename d A . afarensis. I t i s th e

most primitiv e of the know n australopithecines, and on e remnant,

dated at about 3. 9 million years, is thought to lie close to the point of divergence betwee n th e hominid s an d th e Africa n apes. 21 There is,

however, som e evidenc e tha t thi s earl y australopithecin e may also have existed in both robus t an d gracile forms.22 Whethe r or not this

is so, it i s a reasonabl e gues s tha t thi s i s the earlies t hominid , and

the one from whic h subsequent form s evolved.

Compared t o humans , th e australopithecine s ha d fairl y smal l

what resemble d huma n faces . But thei r mos t distinctiv e attribute

was tha t the y walke d uprigh t o n thei r tw o hindlegs , and i n thi s

respect the y clearly resemble d human s rathe r tha n apes . Evidence

for upright walking, or bipedalism, comes in part from th e structure

Even more remarkabl e evidenc e that A . afarensis walke d upright

From Hominids to Humans

Homo habilis

Until recently , it wa s though t tha t th e australopithecine s wer e in -

deed the missing link, and tha t th e line of descent ran fro m afarensis

to africanus t o robustus t o boisei, and thenc e ultimately to humans.

However, thi s simpl e theor y wa s dashe d b y yet further discoveries

from Eas t Africa. In 196 2 Louis Leakey claimed to have found a skull

fragment a t Olduva i i n Tanzani a tha t belonge d no t t o Aus-

tralopithecus bu t t o a true (i f primitive) human. He named thi s spe-

cies Homo habilis, or "practical man, " since its remains wer e associ-

ated with the remnants o f primitive tools. It was dated at about 1.75

million years and therefor e coexisted with Australopithecus.

Still, th e classificatio n of this skul l remained controversia l until,

some 1 0 years later, Louis Leakey's son Richard found a nearly com-

plete skull , dated a t abou t 1. 8 million years, o n th e shore s o f Lake

Turkana i n Kenya . It ha d a cranial capacit y of some 75 2 cc, almost

double that of the australopithecines, although later discoveries sug-

gest tha t thi s wa s a n unusuall y big-headed specimen . This skul l is

generally referred t o simply by its neutral code name, ER-1470, but

was identified as an example of H. habilis by Leakey. It seems clearly

to belon g t o ou r ow n genus . Leake y ha s argue d tha t th e specie s

Homo aros e muc h earlier , an d tha t som e earlie r fossil s ar e i n fac t

complications. Anothe r skull foun d on th e shore s o f Lake Turkana

If anything, the classificatio n presented above is likely to prove too simple. For example, there is a school o f thought tha t suggest s that ther e ma y hav e been two spe-

cies o f H. habilis, on e gracil e an d th e othe r robust. 29 Stephe n Ja y Gould suggest s tha t ther e ma y hav e bee n eve n mor e tha n thre e hominid specie s a t on e time, despite th e fact tha t onl y a single one, ourselves, survives today.30 In his view, evolution is not a question of gradual transformatio n s o much as one of speciation, in which a new line split s fro m a paren t stock . Thi s tend s t o happe n i n punctuate rather tha n gradua l fashion , an d i s likel y t o occu r i n ver y smal l
populations at th e periphery o f the main population, so that geneti c changes ar e rapidl y transmitte d throug h th e population . Fo r rea sons tha t ar e no t entirel y clear , i t seem s tha t ther e wa s a burs t of speciation betwee n some 2. 5 and 2. 0 million years ago .
In any event, there seem s littl e doubt tha t H . habilis was distinct from th e australopithecines . It s brain wa s clearly larger , averaging 659 cc , compare d wit h th e averag e o f 45 1 c c fo r th e gracil e aus tralopithecines..31 I t may also have been differentl y shaped . Thi s has been inferre d fro m th e patter n o f imprint s o n th e insid e o f fossil skulls. These imprint s ca n b e revealed fro m endocast s mad e by fill ing th e insid e o f the skul l o r o f skull fragments with latex , a tech nique pioneered b y Ralph L. Holloway of Columbia University. Dean Falk ha s show n tha t a n endocas t o f the ER-147 0 skull (H. habilis) shows a distinctivel y human-like appearance, wit h squared fronta l lobes an d evidenc e tha t a fol d know n a s th e lunate sulcus, whic h separates th e parietal lob e fro m th e occipital lobe, has been pushe d rearward.3. 2
The location o f the lunate sulcus has played a prominent bu t controversial rol e i n theorie s abou t homini d evolution . It s rearwar d migration i s associated wit h a n increas e i n th e siz e of the parieta l lobe of the brain, whic h i n turn i s thought to be critical in evolution because o f its rol e i n learning , memory, and language . The contro versy has to do with whether th e lunate sulcus had already begun its rearward marc h in the australopithecines. On the basis of the available evidence , whic h i s flimsy , Hollowa y ha s maintaine d tha t i t had,33 while Dea n Fal k ha s argue d tha t wha t Hollowa y and other s have identifie d a s th e lunat e sulcu s i s i n fac t a differen t featur e known a s th e lambdoid suture. 34 Accordin g to Falk , th e patter n o f sulci in the australopithecines wa s ape-like rather than human-like. Falk and Holloway agree, however, that th e rearward locatio n of the lunate sulcu s wa s clearl y present i n H. habilis b y 1. 8 million years
ago. In other physical respects, H . habilis differed rathe r littl e from th e
australopithecines. It s face , jaws , an d teet h wer e similar . The very recent discovery of arm an d le g bones that belonge d to a female H . habilis also reveals that thi s creature wa s surprisingly small, standing just over 3 ft tall. 35 Moreove r the arm s ar e lon g relativ e to th e

legs, a characteristic tha t is more ape-like than human. This feature has suggested that habilis remained i n part a tree-dwelling creature, despite its bipedalism.
The small siz e of this femal e specimen also suggests that th e extreme sexual dimorphism of A. afarensis, i n which males were about twice a s bi g a s females , persisted i n habilis a s wel l as i n it s othe r
descendants, th e late r australopithecines . Th e exaggerate d size of
males relativ e t o female s i s generall y attribute d t o competition among male s fo r access to females, suggesting that habilis had no t yet achieved a social patter n o f cooperation amon g males.

Homo erectus The heyday of H. habilis is said to have been about 1. 8 million years ago. Thereafter , we fin d th e emergenc e o f a mor e advance d form , known as Homo erectus. It is generally assumed that erectus evolved from habilis, althoug h ther e i s n o sur e proo f o f this. Th e earlies t fossil tha t has bee n identified as erectus dates from abou t 2 million years ago, 36 although i t has bee n claime d that thi s specimen might equally b e identifie d a s habilis?37 Specimens dating from abou t 1.6 million year s ag o ar e mor e unequivocall y identifie d a s erectus. 38 However, eve n thi s late r datin g suggest s tha t th e chang e fro m habilis occurred withi n a narrow tim e period.
The mos t complet e skeleto n of erectus was discovere d in 198 4 by Kamoya Kime u at wester n Lak e Turkana in Kenya. 39 It date s fro m about 1.6 5 million years ago and i s of a boy aged about 1 2 years. One remarkable feature i s its height, estimated at abou t 1.6 4 to 1.6 8 m, which i s tal l eve n fo r a moder n 12-year-old . It suggest s a matur e height of around 1.8 2 m, or 6 ft. This is rather talle r than most other estimates fo r this species, which are usuall y put a t aroun d 5 ft. The cranial capacity of erectus ranges fro m som e 800 to 100 0 cc, with an average among early specimens of 942 cc. This is clearly larger than that of habilis, for which the average is 659 cc. There is evidence that the size s o f males an d female s became mor e equal , suggesting an altered social order with greater emphasis on cooperation.
The tools developed by erectus were more sophisticated than those of habilis, and include d handaxes and ston e chopping and scraping tools with symmetrical bifaces. The distinctive handaxes of this species were first found only in Africa bu t late r were discovered in sites throughout th e Ol d World. 40 Erectus wa s evidentl y restricte d to Africa fo r abou t 0. 6 millio n year s bu t the n sprea d t o othe r part s of Europe an d Asia , beginning about 1 million years ago.41 The skull of the so-called Peking man, found i n China, is an exampl e of one that got away , and i s ver y muc h lik e a skul l foun d a t th e Koob i For a camp on the shores of Lake Turkana in Kenya. It has been estimated

that ther e wer e a s man y a s 40,00 0 band s o f thes e earl y hunter gatherers roamin g Europe , Asia, and Africa. 42
There is also evidence that erectus developed the use of fire, which may hav e facilitate d migratio n fro m tropica l t o temperat e zones . Besides warmin g th e cave , fire was usefu l fo r keeping predators a t bay an d fo r roasting meat . Evidenc e from Chin a suggests that Peking ma n dine d mainl y o n veniso n bu t als o secure d suc h varie d game a s elephants , rhinoceroses , wate r buffaloes , horses , camels , antelopes, sheep, tigers, leopards, bears, and hyenas! This enterprising creature probably use d spear s and perhaps pi t trap s t o capture its quarry. Regrettably, it also appears tha t Pekin g men and women consumed th e fles h o f their fellows a s well as of other animals.43

Archaic Homo sapiens Discoveries fro m som e 300,00 0 years ag o indicate a further expansion of brain siz e to within the range of modern humans, some 1200 to 140 0 cc. Again, the assumptio n is that thi s species, an early for m of Homo sapiens, evolved from H. erectus. One famous example is the Swanscombe Man , whose fossilized skul l was discovered in the English villag e of Swanscombe, near London . The firs t fragment was discovered i n 193 5 by loca l cemen t workers , who had stoppe d digging for the da y an d notice d a piece of bone sticking out o f a gravel bank. A second fragmen t wa s foun d a yea r later , and a thir d wa s found i n 1955 , some 7 5 f t fro m th e locatio n of the othe r two . By a miracle, the three pieces belonged to the same individua l and fitted together to form the entire back half of the skull.
This specimen was matche d by another, found i n 193 3 in a gravel pit i n Steinheim , i n Germany . Thi s nicel y complemente d th e Swanscombe find, since it consisted of the fac e an d uppe r jaw. Both skulls ar e though t t o belon g t o th e sam e specie s and t o dat e fro m about 250,00 0 year s ago . Th e crania l capacit y o f these skull s was estimated t o b e abou t 130 0 cc , wel l withi n th e moder n huma n range. Nevertheless, the skull s are no t shape d lik e those of modern humans, an d ar e characterize d b y larg e bro w ridge s an d slopin g foreheads. Indeed , carefu l measurement s an d comparison s wit h modern huma n skull s suggest tha t thi s species was transitional between H . erectus an d moder n humans , th e produc t o f gradua l change rathe r tha n o f a sudde n spurt . Simila r skull s hav e bee n found i n a wide variety of locations, including Africa, Greece , Hungary, and China. The species represented by these scattered discoveries has bee n named archaic Homo sapiens. 44
With this archaic form, there was some increase in the sophistication an d variet y of tools—this i s discussed further i n th e followin g chapter. There is also evidence of ritual burial, perhaps signifying a n

awareness o f th e significanc e of death . Th e earlies t suggestio n of ritual associate d wit h deat h actuall y predate s sapiens an d come s from a sit e i n Chin a datin g fro m abou t 500,00 0 years ago. 45 There,
the evidence suggests , a group o f our ancestors indulge d in a cannibalistic feast , eating th e brain s o f some o f their fellows . The y evidently gained access t o the brain b y widening the hole at the base of the skull , instea d o f smashin g th e skul l an d scoopin g i t out . Thi s difficult an d meticulou s procedure suggest s an element of ritual and respect fo r the dead .
By the en d of the so-calle d archai c world , prior t o the emergence of anatomically modern human s some 200,000 years ago, there seem to have been a t leas t thre e locall y distinct populations of archaic H . sapiens, eac h havin g presumabl y derive d fro m th e group s o f H . erectus, who i n tur n cam e originall y fro m Africa . First , ther e wer e the archai c hominids o f eastern Asia , with their characteristi c peb ble too l technology . The n ther e wer e th e archai c hominid s o f Europe, the Mediterranean, an d central Asia, who probably gave rise to the Neandertals . Finally , ther e wer e th e hominid s o f sub-Sahara n Africa, wh o wer e probabl y th e ancestor s o f anatomicall y moder n humans..46
Before I discuss thi s last transition, however, it is worth digressing
to consider tha t mysteriou s group , the Neandertals.

The Neandertals The Neandertals see m to have emerged som e 100,00 0 years ago and to hav e disappeare d abou t 35,00 0 year s ago . Th e remain s o f thi s creature wer e first discovered i n 185 6 in the Neandertal valley, near Dusseldorf in Germany. At first it was thought that the remains were those of a sick, freakish, but moder n person, and one anatomist even pronounced tha t th e fla t forehea d had bee n cause d by blows to the head.

As John E . Pfeiffer remarks , th e Neanderta l "cam e into the worl d of the Victorian s lik e a naked savag e into a ladies ' sewing circle."48

extinct, or whether the y were the ancestors o f modern humans. They lived through muc h o f the last majo r period of glaciation in Europe, and were probably wel l adapted t o intense cold. They had recedin g chins an d ver y larg e noses , whic h ma y hav e serve d a s radiators t o warm an d humidif y th e air . I t ha s als o bee n said , however, that if one were to clothe and shave a Neandertal man he would be indistinguishable fro m man y of the traveller s on the Ne w York subway.49
The Neandertals als o had mor e durabl e teet h and more muscula r limbs than do modern humans . E . Trinkaus suggests that they were adapted t o long hours of walking about, and tha t they may in fact be representative o f an earlie r bu t undocumente d transitio n between H. erectus and archai c H. sapiens. Hi s view is tha t the y were mor e poorly equipped t o subsist tha n th e early anatomically modern humans becaus e the y lacked certai n weapon s for hunting.50 They may
also hav e bee n relativel y poo r a t communicatin g wit h on e another—a point take n up in Chapter 6.
Nevertheless, on e o f th e strikin g aspect s o f Neanderta l lif e wa s their us e o f ritual. I n a sit e i n Iraq occupie d b y Neandertal s some 60,000 years ago, there are th e remains o f a corpse lai d out on a bed of flowers..51 I n severa l Neanderta l grave s discovere d i n souther n France, th e bodie s wer e lai d ou t alongsid e ston e tools. Some burial sites sugges t a symbolism tha t has no t been deciphered . For example, i n a cav e nea r Mont e Circeo , on th e coas t betwee n Rom e an d Naples, a Neandertal skull with a hole bored into it lies at the center of a circle o f stones.52 It seem s tha t th e Neandertal s understood th e significance o f death.
For all that , th e artifact s lef t b y the Neandertal s an d archai c H . sapiens ar e meage r i n compariso n wit h thos e o f eve n th e earlies t anatomically moder n humans . Reviewin g th e evidence , Pau l Mellars o f Cambridge Universit y has recentl y concluded tha t "th e most significan t observation .. . i s th e ver y spars e evidenc e for almost an y for m o f complex , clearl y symboli c behavio r amongs t Neandertals an d othe r archai c huma n populations." 53 Thing s evidently changed quit e dramaticall y wit h th e appearance o f our next guest, H. sapiens sapiens.

Homo sapiens sapiens—and th e Searc h for Eve The fina l transitio n wa s fro m archai c H . sapiens t o th e so-calle d anatomically moder n variety , or H. sapiens sapiens. These included the Cro-Magnons, who seem t o have replaced th e Neandertals some 35,000 years ago. The transition appear s t o have involved considerable changes in morphology, if not i n brain size; it has been said, for instance, that the Neandertals were much less like modern humans

(thwainthththeeypwoesrseibllikeeexthceepetaiorlnieor fHr.ideerersctouns..5th4e Ne w York City subway) There ar e tw o conflictin g theories a s t o ho w thi s fina l stag e i n
human evolutio n came about . Willia m Howells of Harvard Univer sity ha s calle d thes e th e candelabra model an d th e Noah's Ar k model.55 Accordin g to th e candelabr a model , the evolutio n fro m H . erectus t o archai c H. sapiens, an d thenc e t o H . sapiens sapiens, occurred independentl y at th e differen t location s i n the Ol d World to which erectus ha d migrated . Differen t geographi c population s would therefore have been independent of one another fo r perhaps a million years .
According t o th e Noah' s Ar k model, b y contrast , th e evolutio n from archai c t o moder n H . sapiens occurre d a t a particula r geo graphic location . Thes e anatomicall y moder n human s the n mi grated t o other territories, replacin g the incumbent archaic variety. This woul d explai n th e demis e o f th e Neandertals . Whil e i t con jures u p image s o f ravagin g horde s o f invader s wipin g ou t th e indigenous populations, Ezra Zubro w has pointed out that replace ment o f on e grou p b y th e othe r nee d no t hav e involve d force. A subtle competitiv e edg e i n surviva l tactic s ma y hav e bee n suffi cient t o mak e th e difference . Fo r instance , Neandertal s an d ana tomically moder n human s forage d i n overlappin g territories , an d the moder n human s wer e probabl y simpl y better adapte d t o effi cient foraging , wit h bette r plannin g an d mor e efficien t huntin g techniques.56 Ther e i s als o evidenc e tha t th e Neandertal s di d no t possess a voca l trac t capabl e o f producin g th e rapi d an d flexibl e speech o f modern humans, 57 although as w e shall se e in Chapter 6, this has been disputed .
Although the truth ma y lie somewhere between these two models,
recent evidenc e fro m molecula r biolog y doe s ten d t o suppor t th e Noah's Ark model—sometimes also calle d th e Ou t o f Africa model , for reason s tha t will become clear . This evidence is based o n mutations i n mitochondria l DNA , which mutate s a t th e rat e o f 2 t o 4 percent ever y millio n years . B y geologica l standards , thi s consti tutes a fast-ticking molecular clock. Mitochondrial DNA is inherited only through th e mother, and i s therefore immune to change by the recombination of genes from each parent. That is, it is simply passed on through th e female line, and th e only changes tha t occur ar e due to mutations.
Rebecca L . Cann of the Universit y of Hawaii, with her colleagues Allan C . Wilso n an d Mar k Stoneking , collecte d sample s o f mitochondrial DN A from th e placenta s o f newborn infant s whos e ancestors live d i n fiv e differen t region s o f th e world : Africa, Asia , Europe, Australia , and Ne w Guinea . By comparin g th e sample s

from differen t regions , the y were able to work out how many mutations had taken place since the samples had evolved from a common ancestor. Thi s enable d the m t o construct a n evolutionary tree link ing th e differen t samples . A t the bas e o f the tree , dating from som e 200,000 year s ago , lie s th e commo n femal e ancestor—n o less tha n Eve herself.58
The evidence also indicated tha t Eve lived in Africa. The evolutionary tre e showe d a n earl y spli t into tw o branches, on e of which consisted onl y o f Africa n samples . Ther e wer e mor e divers e form s of DNA on this branch tha n o n the other, which included samples fro m all five geographic regions , indicatin g that th e mitochondria l DNA on th e Africa-onl y branc h wa s older . Thi s als o tie s i n wit h th e fac t that th e oldes t anatomicall y moder n fossil s hav e bee n foun d i n Africa, datin g fro m som e 150,00 0 year s ago . Th e demis e o f th e Neandertals als o appear s t o have occurred a t differen t time s in different part s of Europe, suggesting gradua l migratio n o f competin g populations, perhaps o f H. sapiens sapiens. 59
The muc h publicize d discover y o f Eve, mitochondrial mothe r of us all, does not actually prov e that H. sapiens sapiens evolved at thi s time. Unlike nuclear DNA , mitochondrial DN A is essentially a pas senger i n th e geneti c proces s an d tell s virtually nothing of the spe cies tha t carr y it . Allan C. Wilson and his colleagues have argued i n fact tha t Ev e probably belonge d t o th e archai c specie s H . sapiens, with th e transformation t o the anatomically modern variet y occurring in Africa a t a later time , some 100,00 0 t o 140,00 0 years ago . All present-day humans, the y suggest, are descended fro m tha t Africa n population. Alternatively , the moder n variet y migh t hav e predate d Eve, wit h som e bottlenec k occurrin g 200,00 0 o r s o years ag o tha t reduced ou r ancestry t o the fortunate Eve and her lover.60
Regardless o f precisely when H. sapiens sapiens emerged, both th e biochemical an d archeologica l evidenc e suggest s tha t present-da y humans originate d i n Afric a an d migrate d t o different part s o f the globe. Migratio n pattern s ma y hav e bee n quit e complex ; fo r in stance, New Guinea samples o f mitochondrial DN A are scattered o n several limbs of the evolutionary tree, mixed up with samples fro m all o f the othe r locations . Earl y H. sapiens sapiens evidently moved around quit e extensivel y before settling down i n sufficient isolatio n to evolv e distinctiv e racia l features . Eve n so , th e fossi l evidenc e suggests tha t differen t part s o f th e worl d wer e full y colonize d b y these moder n human s a t differen t times , wit h Asia , Europe , an d Australia bein g settle d b y som e 40,00 0 year s ago , Ne w Guine a b y 30,000 years ago , and th e Ne w World b y 12,00 0 years ago.

An "Evolutionary Explosion " The perio d know n a s th e Uppe r Paleolithic , lasting fro m abou t 35,000 to about 10,00 0 years ago, saw what has been described a s an "evolutionary explosion," 62 recorded chiefl y fro m artifact s found i n Europe an d th e Nea r East . U p t o thi s time , too l cultur e ha d re mained essentiall y Acheulea n an d remarkabl y stable , althoug h there wa s some developmen t amon g th e Neandertals. But with the Cro-Magnons o f th e Uppe r Paleolithic , too l makin g too k o n ne w dimensions, as we shall see in the next chapter .
The earlies t know n cav e drawing s ar e als o associate d wit h th e Cro-Magnons an d likewis e dat e fro m somethin g ove r 30,00 0 year s ago. Th e grea t majorit y o f caves i n whic h drawing s ar e foun d ar e located i n Franc e an d Spain . Mos t of the drawing s ar e o f animals, especially bisons , horses, deer , bears , an d lions . They are ofte n de picted wit h dart s o r spear s stickin g into thei r sides , reflecting the Cro-Magnon concer n wit h hunting . There i s also evidenc e tha t th e Cro-Magnons used cosmetic s an d wor e jewelry.63
Randall Whit e o f Ne w Yor k Universit y has examine d th e orna ments an d image s o f this period i n some detail and has argued tha t they mark a new-found ability to transfer qualities from on e context to another..64 Fo r example , a spea r poin t i s shaped t o resembl e th e snout of a seal, with holes resembling the eyes. White points out that this transfe r o f qualities i s the essenc e o f metaphor, whic h i n tur n may be the basis for technological innovation . The concepts of pointedness o r barbedness ma y be taken from thei r natural context s and applied t o th e constructio n o f new objects . Visual thinking of this sort ma y stil l underli e th e developmen t o f new technology . It ha s also been argue d tha t this phase in human evolutio n saw the emergence o f languag e a s a distinctivel y human attribute , althoug h I shall argue i n Chapter 6 that languag e emerged earlier .
Although ther e wa s a n apparen t incremen t i n th e variet y an d sophistication o f artifacts datin g from thi s period of some 30,000 to 35,000 ago , i t i s unlikely that thi s perio d heralde d an y significan t biological change . Rather , H. sapiens sapiens arrive d i n th e regio n only shortl y befor e tha t tim e an d probabl y brough t wit h the m a t least th e potentia l fo r new technology . These anatomicall y moder n humans probabl y cam e originall y fro m Africa , a s w e hav e seen . Similar developments, associated wit h H. sapiens sapiens, may well have occurred elsewher e an d a t earlie r time s but ma y have lef t n o traces. In any event, there is some evidence that there was a sophisticated cultur e i n Africa tha t predate d th e Cro-Magnons. In his recent review, Mellars writes that "i t is possible to point to at least certain features o f th e archeologica l recor d o f th e Middl e Ston e Ag e (roughly between 100,00 0 and 40,00 0 years ago) in Souther n Afric a

which sugges t a significantl y mor e 'complex ' (an d perhap s mor e 'advanced') patter n o f behavior tha n tha t reflecte d i n th e paralle l records o f the Middle Paleolithic in northern Eurasi a ove r the sam e time range." 65
It shoul d als o b e noted tha t eve n today, humans hav e a potential for skill s and symboli c thought tha t i s probably never, in any one of us, full y exploited . We could learn languages , aspects o f mathematics, crafts , o r sportin g skill s tha t w e d o no t i n fac t learn . W e are endowed wit h considerabl y mor e potentia l tha n w e ca n us e i n a mere lifetime . Th e variet y o f skill s tha t human s ca n lear n i s exploited culturally rathe r than individually , so that differen t peopl e are specialized for different trades—th e plumber, the baker, the potter, th e mathematician , th e professiona l tenni s player , an d s o on .
Again, this might b e taken a s evidence that th e final step in human biological evolutio n was an adventitiou s change rathe r tha n a n incremental adaptation. Exploitation o f that change ma y have take n tens of thousands o f years t o develop and i s still developing.

Overview
The ai m o f thi s chapte r wa s t o provid e a broad-brus h pictur e of human evolutio n throug h time . Many of the conclusion s have bee n speculative, based a s they are mainl y on a few old teeth, bones, an d stones. Although the common ancestor s o f humans an d apes existed but a few million years ago, a minuscule gap of time on an evolutionary scale, that ga p nonetheless produce d th e difference betwee n humans an d apes . I f humans d o indee d posses s som e uniqu e qualit y that separate s them i n some fundamenta l wa y fro m th e apes, the n that ga p become s somethin g o f a chasm . I f onl y som e othe r hominids ha d survived , to give us a better sense o f the evolutionary steps tha t hav e made u s what w e are!
Nevertheless, it now seems possible to establish at least the rough sequence o f events in the emergenc e of humans from apes . The decisive spli t seem s t o have occurre d somewher e i n that transitio n between the Miocene and the Pliocene, 8 million to 4 million years ago, when a gap i n the fossi l recor d occurred . Prio r t o that gap , there is evidence only of ape-like creatures, bu t afte r the gap we find the first signs of an upright-walking hominid, A. afarensis..B y 2 million years ago ther e wer e severa l specie s o f hominids , includin g th e aus tralopithecines an d H . habilis, wh o eventually evolved, with one or two diversions, to become moder n humans .
Despite the extinction of the australopithecines, the step from ap e to hominid was in the long run probably worth taking. The apes tha t

did not take this step have not fared particularly well. Even prior t o the appearanc e o f th e hominids , th e ancestor s o f th e moder n pongids (gorillas , chimpanzees , an d orangutans ) ha d sprea d throughout th e Ol d World ; w e hav e seen , fo r example , tha t Ramapithecus, though t t o b e an ancesto r o f the orangutan , live d at one tim e i n Africa , India , an d souther n Europe . However, presentday pongid s ar e foun d naturall y onl y i n restricte d area s o f West Africa (chimpanzees , gorillas ) an d i n part s o f Indonesi a (orangutans); unlik e th e hominids , the y responde d t o geologica l events b y retreatin g t o saf e but ever-decreasin g habitats . Ove r the past 1 2 million years , th e Ol d Worl d monkey s becam e dominan t over th e pongid s an d toda y inhabi t a wid e area, includin g most of Africa, India , Southeas t Asia , Japan , an d Indonesia . Bu t th e hominids—or at least that resourceful branch of them that managed to survive—were even mor e successful , to th e poin t where a few of them hav e launched themselve s off the earth altogether.
By 1. 6 million years ago , the persevering habilis had give n way to H. erectus, some o f whom migrate d fro m Africa t o Europe an d Asi a about 1 million years ago. H. erectus eventually evolved into archaic forms o f H. sapiens, includin g the Neandertals . However it appear s that ou t o f those wh o remaine d i n Afric a ther e emerge d th e firs t anatomically moder n human , H . sapiens sapiens, bette r know n in some circles a s Eve. This creature embarked on yet another series of migrations, eventuall y replacing th e archaic varieties an d populating the globe.
In th e Uppe r Paleolithic, beginning some 35,00 0 years ago , ther e was evidenc e o f furthe r development , a n evolutionar y explosion, that wa s largel y manifes t i n Europ e an d Asia . In man y ways , this seems t o hav e se t th e stag e fo r th e subsequen t development s tha t culminated i n modern huma n society . Whether it represented a further geneti c advance , o r wa s simpl y a cultura l consequenc e o f genetic changes tha t were alread y present i n H. sapiens sapiens, is one of the critical questions o f human evolution.

Bipedalism The mos t decisiv e even t tha t se t th e earl y hominid s o n th e pat h toward humanity was their assumptio n o f the upright stance. As we saw in the previous chapter, bipedalism seems to have been a characteristic of the very earliest hominids , going back more than 3 million years. It was not present i n the prehistoric apes whose remains date from befor e th e fossi l ga p tha t occurre d abou t 8 to about 4 million years ago.

The Human Condition 5

Since th e australopithecine s ha d brain s n o large r tha n thos e of apes, bipedalism evolved before the increased brain size that characterizes modern humans . Bipedalism freed th e hands for other activities, suc h a s carryin g things , usin g an d manufacturin g tools, an d gesturing. This freeing o f the hands wa s in a sense only the last step in a process tha t ha d alread y begun; as pointed out in Chapter 2 the hands had alread y bee n emancipated fro m thei r functio n a s weight supporters earlie r i n primate evolutio n and had assume d multipurpose role s i n climbing , grasping, an d handling . Bipedalism seems, nevertheless, to have been the decisive step toward the evolution of modern humans , leading to the manufacture of tools, language, and perhaps a restructuring o f thought.
So wha t wa s it , then , tha t le d t o bipedalis m in th e firs t place ? There is a general assumptio n tha t i t had t o do with changes in the geological condition s durin g th e lat e Miocene and earl y Pliocene— that curiou s perio d i n whic h ther e i s a ga p i n th e fossi l record . Recall tha t th e ape s had sprea d quit e far afiel d i n the Ol d World to India, Asia , an d souther n Europe . Remnant s of early hominids, by contrast, hav e bee n foun d onl y i n Africa . Perhap s thi s i s simpl y because conditions in this region were uniquely suited to the preservation an d subsequen t discover y o f fossils , an d becaus e homini d remains fro m other region s were either destroye d o r have remained inaccessible. By contrast, remain s o f other prehistoric animals have been found outsid e o f Africa, a s w e have seen. Moreover, it i s generally supposed tha t geological events in East Africa were so extraordinary tha t the y created precisel y th e conditions necessary fo r evolutionary change, although we shall see that there is room for imaginative license in specifying precisel y wha t thos e conditions were.
I begi n wit h th e conventiona l account . Earl y i n th e Miocene , which span s th e perio d fro m abou t 2 0 millio n t o abou t 8 million years ago , both Eas t an d Wes t Africa consiste d primarily o f forests and woodlands . Bu t the n th e continen t o f Africa collide d with Eur asia. In Kenya and Ethiopia , the earth was heaved upward by more than 300 0 fee t t o form the highland s of these tw o nations. With the upward pressure of molten lava the earth's crust eventually cracked, creating wha t wa s t o become th e Grea t Rif t Valley . Huge volcanoes rose s o high tha t the y created a rain barrier , an d muc h of the forest and woodlan d t o th e eas t gav e wa y t o savanna , o r ope n terrain . Beginning some 1 2 million years ago, East Africa has been characterized b y a n unusua l diversity , ranging fro m th e origina l dens e rai n forest t o semiarid desert , with varying shades in between. This diversity, rathe r tha n an y particula r geographica l stratum , ma y hav e been the key to hominid evolution.

lies th e Lak e Turkan a basin . Th e River Om o drains th e Ethiopia n highlands and deposit s sil t in the lake, a process tha t has been going on fo r some 4 millio n years. It i s this gradua l accumulatio n o f silt that ha s preserve d th e fossil s foun d i n th e regio n an d tha t allow s them to be dated wit h reasonable accuracy. 2
There has been muc h speculatio n a s to why the changed environment o f Eas t Afric a migh t hav e favore d bipedalism . I t ha s bee n suggested, fo r instance , tha t a n uprigh t stanc e enable d th e earl y hominids t o se e farther acros s the ope n savanna , an d s o to receive earlier warnin g o f possible predators. .3 Standin g uprigh t als o free d the hands, allowing them to wield weapons for staving off attackers. To achieve thes e ends, however, it would have been enough to stan d upright onl y occasionally, as other primates do . These factors therefore d o not see m sufficien t t o explain our habitually upright stance .
C. Owt .1 L ovejoy ha s suggeste d tha t th e evolutio n of bipedalism and othe r hominid trait s ma y hav e depended o n the variety of terrains created by geological events in East Africa , rather than on any particular kin d of terrain (suc h as savanna). Greater variation in the seasons ma y hav e als o encourage d th e earl y hominid s t o mov e t o different habitats at different time s of the year. They therefore probably lived a nomadic life , movin g from on e habitat t o another i n the search fo r food. However, they also had t o keep their numbers up by increasing th e birth rat e and reducin g mortalit y as far as possible. This required intensiv e nurturing o f infants, whic h conflicte d wit h the nomadic lifestyle . Lovejoy argues tha t thes e pressures le d to the creation o f th e nuclea r family , wit h th e femal e carin g fo r th e offspring an d th e mal e roamin g fo r food t o bring bac k t o th e famil y base.4
Bipedalism ma y hav e evolved, Lovejoy suggests , because i t free d the hands an d arm s for carrying food . Thi s would no t hav e been a big step (s o to speak) in evolution, since other primates ar e capabl e
of limited bipedalism. Chimpanzees, for example, can walk for short distances o n their hind legs , although they rapidly become fatigued. But th e persisten t pressur e o n th e earl y hominid s t o gathe r foo d may hav e eventuall y selected fo r the alteration s i n bon e structur e that allowe d uprigh t walkin g t o become th e natura l mean s o f getting about.
Lovejoy compares the hominid lifestyl e with that of other species, such a s birds , tha t als o maintai n nuclea r familie s an d gathe r foo d for thei r dependents . Amon g hornbills, fo r example, th e mal e col lects food for his female mate and thei r offspring. In some 90 percent of bird species there i s a monogamous relation between the parents. However, birds ar e abl e to carry foo d i n their mouths or t o regurgitate i t fo r their young , whereas thes e options were impractica l for

the ancestra l hominid s b y virtue of their anatomy. Consequently a special adaptation , bipedalism , wa s neede d fo r hominid s t o solve the problem o f transporting food .
Lovejoy's scenario appear s t o give the major role to the adventurous bu t monogamou s males , wh o brough t bac k foo d t o th e seden tary female s an d thei r offspring . A mor e extrem e male-centere d
view wa s suggeste d earlie r b y Robert Ardrey in his boo k The Hunting Hypothesis (1976) . He argued tha t bipedalis m would have free d the hands for carrying primitive weapons, and later for manufacturing more sophisticated ones , in order t o slaughter other animals for food. Ardrey assumed tha t i t was the males who went hunting, and since hunting required cooperation , socia l bonding, and invention, human destin y was place d firml y i n th e hand s o f the male s o f the species.
Needless t o say , this ide a ha s no t gon e unchallenged. Two American anthropologists, Nancy Tanner an d Adrienne Zihlman, have argued that th e females were at th e hub of evolutionary adaptation; it was they who invented tools for collecting, who carried foo d to share with offspring , an d wh o feminize d male s b y choosing th e mor e co-
operative, socia l one s a s mates . Moreover , the critica l activit y for which tools were invented was not hunting, but rather the gathering of foodstuff s suc h a s plants , eggs , termites , an d smal l burrowin g animals.5
A different scenari o agai n has been proposed b y Mary Leakey and her colleagues. They suggest tha t the early hominids were migrating scavengers wh o followe d hug e herd s o f ungulates, suc h a s wildebeests and zebras , over fairl y lon g distances in order t o gain acces s to thei r carcasses . I n orde r t o d o this , the y had t o carr y thei r offspring, and i t wa s this , rather tha n th e carryin g of foodstuffs, tha t was critical in the evolution of bipedalism. An argument against this view is that th e teeth of the early hominids seem better adapted t o a vegetarian die t tha n t o a die t o f meat, an d woul d certainl y hav e been inadequat e fo r breakin g throug h th e toug h hid e o f a zebr a carcass, fo r example. Perhaps, lik e vultures, the hominids relied on better equippe d scavengers , suc h a s hyenas , t o bit e throug h th e hide, but thi s could hav e bee n a dangerou s strateg y give n that th e hyena was also a potential attacker . Leakey and her colleagues suggest, however, that i t was precisely this danger tha t selected for the ability t o mak e ston e tools , s o tha t carcasse s coul d b e cu t an d scraped withou t having to rely on other animals to do it.6
These rathe r differen t scenario s illustrat e th e speculativ e char acter o f th e explanation s for bipedalism . Nevertheless, they shar e the common theme that habitual bipedalism was selected because it facilitated carrying , whethe r o f offsprin g o r foodstuffs , whil e th e

more constructive use of the hand s for the development of tools and for communicatio n probabl y cam e later . But whil e this is probably the prevailin g opinion , ther e i s anothe r theor y tha t i s altogethe r
more exotic, although it has no t yet found genera l acceptance.

An Aquatic Phase ?

In 1960 , Sir Aliste r Hard y propose d tha t th e earl y hominids might

have passed throug h a n aquatic phase i n which they lived in the sea.

The idea was taken up and developed by Elaine Morgan in her books

The Descent o f Woman (1972 , revise d i n 1985 ) and Th e Aquatic Ap e

(1982). Morgan is a freelance writer rather tha n a professional physi-

cal anthropologist, whic h may explain why the theory has not been

taken very seriously by academics. One influential critic dismisses it

entirely, asking why we should have abandoned a n aquatic life if we

have flippers, lik e other d wa s scornful : "Elain e

Morgan's Th e Descent o f Woman i s a speculativ e reconstructio n of

human prehistor y fro m the woman' s poin t of view—and as farcical as more famous tales by and fo r men."8
Still, the theory has some plausibility.9 It may explain our relative

lack of bodily hair, unique among the primates. Our hominid ancestor evolve d a s th e nake d ape, 10 just a s "th e porpois e turne d int o a

naked cetacean , th e hippopotamus int o a nake d ungulate , the walrus into a naked pinniped, and the manatee into a naked sirenian."11

To retain warmth , bodily hair was replaced b y a layer of subcutane-

ous fat. This feature is also unique among the primates, but commo n

to al l aquati c animals . Th e shap e o f th e nos e i s anothe r huma n

peculiarity. The nostrils ar e covere d wit h an elaborat e cartilag e so

that the y ope n downward , towar d th e feet . Thi s adaptation woul d

have allowed the aquatic hominids to swim and dive without having

water force d up their noses .

Humans ar e the only primates tha t weep, and we weep salt tears .

Again, however , thi s i s a characteristi c tha t w e share wit h marin e

animals. Morgan quote s fro m R . M. Lockley's book Grey Seal, Com-

mon Seal that th e seal' s tears "flo w copiously , as in man , when th e seal i s alarmed , frightened , o r otherwis e emotionall y agitated."12

Again, human swea t i s salty, and ou r sweatin g is unique among th e

primates a s a coolin g system . Human s ar e als o uncommonl y at -

tracted t o water, a s a visit to any popular beac h wil l testify .

Morgan suggests that aquatic lif e would have favored bipedalism.

Initially, an upright posture would have been helpful i n wading, and

it i s also natura l i n treadin g water. More important, though, swim-

ming is most efficientl y performe d with the lower limbs in line with

the body. Penguins and beaver s also adop t a bipedal walk when on

land. Swimmin g migh t als o explai n ou r highl y developed sense of balance, since gravity no longer provides a cue and orientation mus t depend o n internal mechanisms . Onl y th e sea lion can match , an d indeed surpass, th e human sens e o f balance.
Why, then, do we not hav e flippers lik e these other aquati c mam mals? Morgan' s answe r i s tha t the y wer e no t needed , sinc e swimming was probably accomplishe d b y a frog-like kick rather tha n th e use o f flippers . Indeed , huma n infant s perfor m a natura l breast stroke action , an d i t ha s ofte n bee n show n tha t childre n ca n b e readily taugh t t o swim even before they can walk. Even so, Morgan quotes Si r Aliste r Hard y a s statin g tha t 9 percent o f boys an d 6. 6 percent o f girls hav e som e webbin g betwee n th e secon d an d thir d toes. The human han d i s also unlike that of an ape in that there i s a web o f skin betwee n th e finge r an d thum b tha t prevent s u s fro m stretching th e angle between them mor e tha n about 9 0 degrees.
These various physical difference s between ourselve s an d the apes do suggest a n aquati c past , neatl y recapitulate d i n th e practic e of baptising infant s by immersin g the m i n water . Bu t Morga n i s les s convincing i n he r speculation s a s t o when an d wh y our ancestor s may hav e take n t o th e sea . He r origina l notio n wa s tha t thi s occurred durin g th e Pliocen e whe n ther e wa s a prolonge d drought13, causing the trees to wither and the forests to shrink. Since our ancestors wer e smalle r an d les s aggressiv e tha n som e o f th e othe r hominoids, the y wer e drive n ou t ont o th e ope n savannah , wher e they wer e poorl y adapte d t o cope. The only solution was to take to the sea, where ther e was an abundance o f accessible food .
In a recen t about-turn , however , Morga n ha s argue d tha t th e aquatic phase wa s probably a response, no t to drought, but to flooding!14 Sh e refer s t o researc h b y Leo n P . La Lumier e tha t suggest s there was extensive flooding in northeast Afric a durin g the fossil ga p of 4 to 8 million years ago , and tha t larg e areas were inundated and remained belo w se a leve l for lon g periods. A n area o f high groun d now know n a s Danaki l Hors t woul d a t tha t tim e hav e bee n a n island, and i t is a possible sit e where a group of hominoid apes might have foun d themselve s cu t off . Dwindling resource s woul d hav e forced the m t o seek sustenac e fro m th e sea, an d t o gradually adap t to an aquatic existence .
Such a scenari o migh t explai n th e divergenc e o f th e earl y aus tralopithecines fro m th e African apes , and ma y even account fo r the fossil gap . Accordin g t o Stephe n Ja y Gould , th e evolutio n of ne w species typicall y occur s i n very smal l population s a t th e peripher y of th e mai n population , an d th e ide a tha t ou r ancestor s wer e trapped o n island s meet s thos e condition s rathe r precisely—more so, i n fact , tha n traditiona l account s tha t emphasiz e terrestria l

changes. The earliest homini d fossils probably date fro m a return t o a more terrestrial habitat , although both the australopithecines and H. habilis ar e ofte n depicte d a s having lived beside rivers or lakes. An aquati c phas e migh t als o hel p explai n why we humans see m t o
be th e od d one s out amon g th e hominoi d ape s i n term s o f external morphology, while at th e molecular level we seem to be closer to the chimpanzee than th e chimpanzee is to the gorilla.
Even i f ther e i s som e trut h t o th e aquati c theory , Morga n ha s undoubtedly overstate d th e cas e an d exaggerate d it s importance . She suggests, for example, that speec h and th e manufacture of tools might be attributed t o the aquatic phase , but thes e characteristic s probably di d no t emerg e unti l muc h later . But I suspec t tha t th e issue i s not a cut-and-drie d (o r shoul d I sa y wet-and-dried? ) one. I think it i s a fair observation that , eve n today, we are conspicuously more aquati c tha n ou r ap e cousins, and th e question ma y not be so
much whethe r ou r ancestors passe d throug h a n aquatic phase , but rather ho w complet e wa s thei r immersio n i n a n aquati c environment, for how long, and t o what exten t did it alter our morphology?

Sexual Practices
There is another importan t se t of characteristics tha t mar k human s off fro m th e othe r primate s an d tha t migh t have appeared earl y in hominid evolution . Compare d wit h th e apes , human s indulg e in decidedly unusua l sexua l practices . Th e estrous cycl e in women is virtually imperceptibl e fro m th e outside , a s i t were , an d human s copulate mor e or less independently of ovulation. In nonhuman primates, by contrast, sexua l receptivity in females is very largely confined t o th e perio d whe n th e femal e come s visibl y int o estrus ; a t other times , male s an d female s show littl e interes t i n one another. The total tim e tha t a femal e primate ma y b e sexually receptive in the cours e o f a 20-yea r lif e spa n i s probabl y les s tha n 2 0 weeks..15 This is a far cry from th e sor t of human behavio r reported b y gossip columnists.
These changes ar e usuall y interpreted i n terms o f the importance of th e pair bond i n maintaining the nuclea r family . The progressive decline i n estrus an d th e mor e o r les s continuou s sexua l receptiveness of human female s increase th e deman d fo r copulatory vigilance, to borrow Lovejoy' s delightful phrase,16 in order t o ensure fertiliza tion. Tha t is , i t favor s monogam y an d regula r copulation , and s o keeps the famil y together . In Lovejoy' s view , this was critical to th e nomadic life that th e early hominids pursued, and was also essential to the nurturanc e and protectio n of the infants .

istics tha t distinguis h th e sexe s see m t o appl y a s distinctivel y to

women as to men, and appear t o relate t o the pair bond rather tha n

to any distinctivel y male behavior . The enlarged breasts o f the hu -

man femal e are a t leas t a s conspicuous as the male penis, although

both feature s ar e usuall y modestl y covere d i n contemporar y soci-

eties. Men and wome n are also distinguished by marked difference s

in bodily shape and i n the patter n o f growth o f hair.

culture i n determining mating practices an d difference s i n appear-

ance between men and women, and it is true that culture can greatly

modify suc h thing s as the clothes people wear, their hair styles, and

the perfume s and makeu p the y use. According to Lovejoy , however,

the causal relatio n goe s quit e th e othe r way ; the very fact tha t cul-

ture play s suc h a rol e i s evidenc e of the primac y of the pai r bon d itself.19

As might be anticipated , Elaine Morgan presents a rather differ -

ent vie w o f th e origin s o f huma n sexua l behavio r base d o n th e aquatic theory.20 Life in the sea, she suggests, was responsible for the

decline i n estrus . Th e uprigh t stanc e als o le d t o a chang e i n th e

positioning of the vagina , which cam e t o be located mor e ventrally

(i.e., toward th e fron t o f the body) . This, in turn, forced a change in

the position s adopte d durin g copulation . Th e norma l procedur e

among primates i s for the mal e t o moun t th e femal e fro m behind ,

but amon g humans , o f course, the act i s usually accomplished with

the couple facing on e another .

Morgan goes on to suggest that this altered sexual posture made it

difficult fo r women t o achiev e orgasm, which is elicited most effec -

tively following stimulatio n of the ventra l (i.e. , forward) wall of th e

vagina. Fronta l copulatio n shift s th e pressur e o f vaginal stimula-

tion, so that it is the dorsal (rear ) wall that receives maximum stimu-

lation. Th e Ne w Zealan d anthropologis t Pete r J . Wilso n has sug -

In humans , b y contrast , i t i s ofte n prolonge d an d man y wome n never reach orgasm .
Perhaps it is because successfu l sex is so difficult tha t we humans are s o obsessed wit h it . I n hi s nove l The Lyre o f Orpheus, the Canadian novelis t Robertso n Davie s has on e o f his character s remark :
"Unfortunately Man is the only creature to have made a hobby and a fetish o f Sex, and th e be d i s the great playpen of the world."22
Morgan also suggests that the so-called pair-bond enhancers actually have littl e to d o bonding. The breasts o f the human femal e ar e larger and more conspicuous than those of other primates, not as an enticement t o ensure tha t he r mat e keep s returning each evening, but t o provide the feeding infan t with something to hold onto, lest it slip awa y fro m th e mother' s largel y hairles s body . The enlarge d buttocks of the huma n femal e enabled he r t o sit mor e comfortably, especially when feeding . Th e hair o n women's head s als o provides something fo r th e infan t t o gra b hol d of , especially i n th e water ; Morgan note s tha t women generall y retain th e hair o n their heads, while men are ap t t o go bald. Compared with other primates , men have unusuall y large penises, bu t accordin g t o Morgan, this too is not expressl y a pair-bon d enhancer . Rather , i t i s an adaptatio n t o frontal sex , which simply requires a longer penetrative organ.

The use and Manufacture of Tools
Jane va n Lawic k Goodall define d th e us e o f tools a s "th e us e o f an external object as a functional extensio n of the mouth or beak, hand or claw , in th e attainmen t o f an immediat e goal."23 By thi s defini tion, human s ar e b y n o mean s uniqu e i n usin g tools . I n hi s boo k Animal Tool Behavior (1980) , Benjami n B. Bec k document s man y examples o f th e us e o f tool s b y othe r animals , includin g invertebrates, fish, amphibians, birds, an d mammals . Even the makin g of tools is not uniquely human. For example, blue jays kept in a laboratory were observe d t o use newspaper t o make a tool with which to rake i n foo d pellet s tha t wer e ou t o f their reach , an d on e bird als o made pellets of wet paper to mop it s food dish.24
Most mammals pic k up food an d other objects with their mouths, but i n primate s th e han d ha s becom e specialize d for this purpose . Primates vary, however, in the degree to which they can modify thei r grip accordin g t o th e siz e an d shap e o f th e object . For example, prosimians an d mos t Ne w World monkeys grasp an object , regardless of its size or shape, by simply closing the hand around it. This is known as a power grip. All Old World monkeys and apes , by contrast,

The Human Condition 6

are able to use what is called a precision grip, in which small objects

may b e picke d u p an d hel d b y th e finge r tips . Th e precision gri p

depends on the ability to oppose th e thumb and forefinge r b y rotating the thumb at th e base.25 This ability is most highly developed in

humans; accordin g t o Richard E . Passingham, "The skill and preci -

sion of the huma n han d i s without doub t th e resul t o f selection for greater dexterity in the use and manufactur e of tools."26

Primates, however, are als o inveterat e tool users. Cebus monkeys

seem t o b e exceptiona l amon g monkey s for th e variet y of ways i n

which the y us e object s t o serv e thei r ow n ends . They use sticks t o

rake i n food, arrange stick s s o that the y ca n clim b the m t o reac h

food, us e twig s t o pus h foo d fro m tube s o r t o pr y ope n lids , stack

boxes i n order t o reach food , thro w object s at peopl e or other ani -

mals, thro w object s t o knock down suspende d food , an d us e stones or sticks t o break th e shell s o f nuts.27 Chimpanzees also use tools in

similar ways, adding some variants of their own. Modern chimpan -

zees i n th e wil d use twig s to extract termite s from thei r hole s and,

indeed, fashio n th e twig s fo r thi s purpos e b y strippin g the m o f leaves and bark. 28 They also use stones for cracking open palm nuts, even transportin g the m t o where th e nut tree s grow. 29 Robert Foley

writes tha t "too l us e can thu s b e said t o be a plesiomorphic (ancestral, primitive) trait o f the African hominoids."30

Foley suggests tha t th e next development was the manufacture of

stone tools, and that this was unique to the genus Homo. The earliest

stone tool s tha t have bee ago and wer e discovered

extensive documentation o f early tools has come from thos e found a t

Olduvai Gorg e i n Tanzania , thi s too l cultur e i s know n a s th e

Oldowan culture. Oldowan tools were made by striking flakes from a

stone core, giving rise to two sorts of tools. Core tools consisted of the

core itself , sharpened alon g one edge by the removal of the flakes. An

example is the stone chopper , which made up some 65 percent of the

early Oldowa n toolkit . The flakes could als o b e modifie d b y trim -

ming the edge to produce flake tools. An example is the stone scraper ,

which mad e u p som e 1 9 percent o f th e Oldowa n kit. About seve n

different tool s ca n b e identifie d fro m th e earlies t Oldowa n phase , rising to over ten i n the so-called Developed Oldowan phase.32

Although thes e tool s ar e usuall y attribute d t o H . habilis, i t ha s

recently bee n claime d tha t a t leas t on e australopithecine , A . ro-

bustus (sometime s known a s Paranthropus robustus), may also hav e

developed tools . Thi s claim i s base d o n recen t fossi l evidenc e con-

However, the precision gri p in robustus may have had to do with the

use of bones o r stick s a s instrument s for digging, rather tha n with

the manufacture of stone tools. Certain bones discovered i n associa-

tion wit h A . robustus revea l a distinctiv e pattern o f wear tha t ca n only be reproduced, it is claimed, by digging.34

The development of stone tool s is therefore probably characteris-

tic only of the lin e that led to Homo. Ston e tools seem to have been

primarily associated with the cutting and scraping of carcasses, an d

thus with the eating of meat. Whereas robustus adapted to life on the

dry grasslan d an d woodlan d environmen t b y seekin g plant foods ,

Homo probably scavenged for animal meat, and by 1.6 million years

ago, H. erectus is though t o have consumed animal meat at a higher level tha n an y livin g nonhuman primate. 3.5 Sinc e source s o f mea t

would have been widel y dispersed, thi s would have encouraged co-

operation amon g males in the search for meat. We begin to see, then,

the emergence o f a social order in which specialized tools and per -

haps ways of communicating becam e important .

There ha s bee n som e debat e a s t o whethe r th e manufactur e of

stone tools represents a conceptual advance, or whether it was essen-

tially at th e leve l of, say, the shapin g of twigs for termiting, as prac-

ticed b y chimpanzees . Th e actua l manufacturin g proces s wa s

scarcely mor e complex ; the tool s were made by simply striking the

core ston e wit h a hammerstone, an d i t has bee n suggeste d that n o more tha n thre e o r fou r blow s wer e required,,36 a techniqu e tha t

could probabl y b e learne d b y simpl e observation . Indeed , i t ha s been successfull y taught t o a n orangutan 37 an d eve n t o graduat e students in California.38

However, the manufactur e of Oldowan stone tools seems t o hav e

been more purposeful than too l construction by other primates. For

example, the tool s used b y chimpanzees ar e typicall y found withi n

reach o f the foo d source , wherea s ther e i s evidence that H . habilis carried ston e tool s t o site s u p t o 1 0 km away. 39 Ralph L . Holloway

has argued tha t Oldowa n tools were mad e accordin g to a standar d plan, implying a creative abilit y that i s uniquely human.40 In simi-

lar vein, Mary D. Leakey has suggested that the mere modification o f

tools should b e distinguishe d from too l manufacture; th e chimpan-

zee modifie s a twi g t o mak e i t mor e effective , wherea s H . habilis actually manufactured ston e tool s according to a prescribed plan..41

Manufacture ma y als o be distinguished from modificatio n i n that

it involve s operating o n on e objec t wit h another ; a s Bec k notes,

"Unquestionably ma n i s the onl y anima l that t o date has bee n ob-

served to use a tool to make a tool."42 It may not be too fanciful t o see

in thi s proces s th e firs t sig n o f recursion, whic h i s critica l t o th e

nature of human language, as we shall see in Chapter 5. Beck goes on

to warn, though , that attempt s t o defin e wha t i s special abou t th e

morphic—part of the often desperat e campaign , perhaps, to charac-

terize ourselves as superior t o other animals.

extract mea t fro m carcasses , no w though t to have been scavenged

rather tha n hunted. Beck points out that the manufacture of tools is

also extractive in th e sens e tha t th e too l i s derived from a piece of

stone. The idea tha t on e objec t ma y b e embedded i n anothe r ma y

have been another precursor of language; as we shall see in Chapter

5, huma n languag e characteristicall y involve s the embeddin g of

structures (phrases , clauses ) in other structures.

Whatever the importance o f Oldowan tool culture, it does seem to

have marked the beginning of a progression. With H. habilis' succes-

sor, H . erectus, and th e emergenc e o f the so-calle d Acheulea n tool

culture, w e find tools tha t are mor e sophisticated tha n thos e of the

Oldowan culture . Th e mai n developmen t i n th e so-calle d Lowe r

Acheulian wa s th e emergenc e o f the bifacia l handaxe , made b y re-

moving flakes from two faces of the stone core to produce a sharper, more pointed tool that could fit comfortably into the hand.44 Indeed,

the handax e wa s th e hallmar k o f H. erectus and wa s par t o f th e

baggage whe n erectus migrated fro m Afric a t o Europe an d Asia . In

the lat e Acheulean, cores wer e also prepared s o that flake s o f speci-

fied sizes and shape s coul d be struck from the m to produce special-

ized tool s for such activitie s as cutting, scraping, boring, and skinning.45 The techniqu e of using prepared core s i n this way i s known

as th e Levallois technique, an d wa s mor e full y exploite d by th e ar -

chaic H. sapiens that followed.

Unlike Oldowa n tools , Acheulea n tool s wer e probabl y shar p

enough t o cut flesh . I t has bee n suggested tha t th e skill required t o

make th e tool s o f thi s perio d coul d no t easil y be gaine d b y mer e

observation bu t require d instruction . I n any event, the California n

graduate student s introduce d earlier , wh o wer e abl e t o cop y th e

manufacture o f Oldowa n tool s fro m mer e observation , wer e evidently unable to learn Acheulean technique in this way.46

With th e sprea d o f erectus to differen t location s throughou t th e

Old World , and wit h th e emergenc e of archaic H. sapiens, the too l

cultures develope d characteristics peculia r t o individua l popula-

tions. For example, in eastern Asi a ther e was a reversion to pebble

tool industries , whil e i n Indi a th e handax e traditio n wa s main tained. The biface industry prevailed i n Africa, Europe , and wester n Asia, with distinctiv e variations, such a s the Levalloi s technique in sub-Saharan Africa. .47 Throughout this period, however, the development of tools was ver y slow, with little change for tens of thousands of years at a stretch. Tools were associated wit h the different populations themselves . Tha t is , H. habilis ha d thei r distinctiv e tool technology, and th e differen t group s of H. erectus and archai c H. sapiens had theirs , bu t ther e was very little change within thes e groups , a t least up to about 70,00 0 years ago. Tools were as distinctive of different populations as the morpholog y of the fossil s themselves.
Things began t o change dramaticall y wit h th e en d of the archaic world an d th e emergenc e o f so-called blad e technologies . This occurred first about 70,000 years ago in Africa, wher e it emerged fro m the earlier flake industr y tha t ha d develope d there . Recall that thi s involved th e populatio n tha t ha d probabl y evolve d into anatomi cally moder n humans . Th e appearanc e o f blad e technolog y wa s more abrup t durin g th e so-calle d evolutionar y explosion 48 of th e Upper Paleolithic , beginnin g som e 30,00 0 t o 40,00 0 years ago , n o doubt coincidin g wit h th e arriva l o f H. sapiens sapiens. Among th e Cro-Magnons of that era in Europe, tool making took on new dimensions, wit h ove r 13 0 different tool s bein g identified . Th e Levallois technique was develope d further so that a number of different tool s could be mad e fro m th e flake s struc k fro m a single core—tools for such varied activities as carving, engraving, chiseling, gouging, and so on. This activity may reflec t somethin g of the hierarchical property of language, whereby sentences can be elaborated into words or words into the primitive alphabet o f spoken speech (phonemes).
At thi s stage i n evolution we also find the cleares t evidenc e of the joining of parts, as in the haftin g o f a wooden handle to an axehead or a ston e poin t t o a woode n spear . I t i s possible , however , that hafting emerge d earlier, .49 and , o f course, component s o f tools that were mad e o f wood o r othe r perishabl e substance s hav e no t sur vived fo r our inspection . In an y event , the joinin g of parts t o for m new entities is also a characteristic o f human language , as we shall see in Chapter 5.
From tha t tim e on, tool technology never looked back. It became central to human surviva l and adaptation. Technologies change rapidly both within and between populations, adapting flexibly to local demands. Accordin g to Foley , thes e characteristics hol d for all ana tomically modern humans, whereas for all other forms of hominids, including the Neandertals and archai c //. sapiens, tool technologie s remained stabl e fo r lon g periods.50 I suggeste d above that som e of the primitiv e features of languag e may b e glimpse d i n primitiv e

stone tools , bu t wit h th e appearanc e o f blade technolog y an d th e ensuing explosion o f manufacture and invention , we see a propert y that i s more unequivocall y associated wit h human language . That property i s generativity—the abilit y to construct a n unlimited number of different form s from a finite number of elementary parts. This theme wil l play a major rol e later in this book.

Brain Size

As we have seen, the brain has virtually tripled in size since the time

of th e earlies t hominids , a n increas e tha t i s much to o grea t t o b e attributed t o th e muc h les s dramati c increas e i n bod y size. 51 I t i s

due almost entirel y to the species Homo, sinc e there wa s very little

increase i n brai n siz e among th e australopithecine s durin g th e 1.5 million year s o f their recorde d history. 52 However, the brai n siz e of

the earliest clea r form o f H. habilis, ER-1470, was already consider-

ably large r tha n tha t o f any o f th e australopithecines . Dea n Falk

suggests, however , tha t thi s creatur e probabl y descende d fro m a gracile australopithecine,,53 i n whic h cas e ther e mus t hav e bee n a

fairly rapi d increas e i n brain siz e in the process o f transition.

Initially, a t least , th e large r brai n wa s probabl y a consequenc e

rather tha n a cause o f behavioral changes brought about as a result

of bipedalism . Fo r example , we hav e see n tha t th e manufactur e of

stone tools was associated wit h H. habilis, but probably not with the

australopithecines. Thi s ma y i n par t explai n habilis' large r brain.

Nevertheless, i t woul d b e wron g t o attribut e increasin g brain siz e

wholly t o a selectiv e pressure t o develop more sophisticate d tools .

We sa w tha t too l technolog y change d relativel y littl e fro m habilis

through erectus to archaic sapiens, and actuall y remained stati c for

long periods, despit e th e fact tha t brai n size increased dramaticall y

over thi s sam e interva l t o reac h it s presen t level . Falk suggests ,

moreover, tha t th e increas e proceeded gradually, though

bu t that

the greates t change s occurre d durin g a period whe n tool s scarcel y

changed at all . The real explosio n in manufacturing took place only

after th e emergence o f H. sapiens sapiens and wa s not accompanie d

by any increase i n brain size .

Although th e manufactur e o f stone tool s may hav e given the ini-

tial kick to an increas e i n brain size , then, the subsequen t develop-

ment mus t hav e ha d othe r causes . On e possibilit y i s tha t th e

The cooperative foraging fo r sources o f meat woul d have favored mor e sophisticated forms o f communicatio n an d perhap s th e developmen t of specialized skill s within th e socia l group . I t ma y hav e been thes e factors that wer e largel y responsible fo r the increase in brain size.
The possession o f a larg e brain i s not itsel f a sufficien t guarante e of superio r intelligence . If it were , we shoul d hav e to yiel d prid e of place t o th e whale , whose brai n weigh s a massive 6800 gm. In fac t the huma n brain , whic h weigh s aroun d 140 0 gm, rank s n o higher than fourth , followin g thos e o f th e elephan t (abou t 470 0 gm ) an d dolphin (somewha t ove r 170 0 gm) . It i s als o amusin g t o conside r something o f the rang e o f variation between humans. The philosopher Immanuel Kan t is said to had a brain weighin g 160 0 gm, while the poet Joha n Christolp h Friedrich Schille r carried a brain of 1785 gm. Mos t massiv e o f all wa s tha t o f Ivan Serveyvic h Turgenev, th e Russian novelist and short-story writer, whose spinal column had to support a brai n weighin g 201 2 gm. However , the novelis t Anatole France i s sai d t o hav e ha d a brai n weighin g only 101 7 gm, a siz e normally associate d wit h idiocy ! In fairness , it shoul d b e sai d tha t he was 8 0 years ol d when h e died , and th e brai n i s known to grow smaller fro m abou t th e ag e o f 3 0 on. Me n hav e a n averag e brai n weight o f abou t 144 0 gm , compare d wit h abou t 123 0 g m fo r women—a differenc e tha t i s presumed t o b e o f no importance , except tha t boy s may be slightly more susceptibl e tha n girl s to minor brain injur y a t birth.55
Anxious no doubt to restore human s t o the top of the evolutionary tree, a number o f scientists have tried t o devise measures involvin g brain siz e tha t compensat e fo r difference s i n bod y size . Kar l S . Lashley argue s tha t th e rati o o f brain tissu e t o tota l bod y weight should indicat e th e amoun t o f tissu e i n exces s o f that require d t o serve th e integrative centers of the body , and s o should reflec t mor e intellectual function. .5. 6 Harr y J . Jerison ha s develope d a somewha t more sophisticate d index , called th e encephalization quotient (EQ), which is the ratio of the actual brain siz e to the size expected for an animal of equivalent body size. 57
It i s with relie f that w e learn tha t th e E Q restores human s t o th e top o f th e pile , wit h a valu e o f 7.4416 . The dolphin , interestingly enough, comes second , with a n E Q of 5.3055, followed b y the chimpanzee with 2.4865. The elephant, sometimes praised (probably erroneously) for it s power s o f memory, has a quotient of 1.8717 , and th e rat, onc e th e darlin g of experimental psychology, ha s a quotien t of 0.4029.
Richard E . Passingham and Georg e Ettlinger have also examined

the relation between brai n size and bod y size among the primates.58 If one leaves out humans, there is an orderly increase in brain size as body siz e increases . However , there i s a strikin g discontinuity between humans an d th e other primates, described by Passingham as "perhaps th e single most important fac t about mankind. Our brain is three times as large as we would expect for a primate of our build."59
Another quotien t o f som e interes t i s th e rati o o f th e siz e o f th e cerebral cortex , th e outsid e laye r o f th e brai n an d th e on e mos t recently evolved , t o tha t o f th e brai n a s a whole . In human s th e cerebral corte x constitute s abou t 8 0 percent o f the brain , i n ape s about 7 4 percent, i n monkey s about 6 8 percent, and i n prosimians about 5 0 percent. In this case, however, there is no suggestion of any discontinuity, fo r example, humans diffe r fro m ape s b y as muc h a s apes differ fro m monkeys .

Changes in Stages of the Lif e Span
Another development tha t was o f undoubted significance i n human evolution was a change in the duration s o f stages in the lif e span. In the well-know n passage fro m Shakespeare' s A s Yo u Like It, Jaque s identifies seve n "ages" of man, but fo r present purpose s five will do. First i s the gestational phase, betwee n conception and birth. Second is infancy, ,wit h much mewlin g and puking , betraying a total dependence on the parents. Third is the subadult phase, when the whining school-boy unwillingl y follows hi s mor e agreeabl e siste r t o school. Fourth is adulthood, the sighing lover and the soldier, the stage when reproduction i s possible, a t leas t whe n th e sighin g and th e fighting are over . Fifth i s the postreproduction phase , th e lea n and slippere d pantaloon, and th e oblivion of second childishness.
Figure 3.1 shows the duration of each phase i n humans and i n four other primat e specie s ordere d accordin g t o thei r similarit y to humans. All five phases are longest in humans and increase in duration in th e primate s a s the y approac h human s i n similarity . Thus eac h phase i n th e chimpanzee , ou r closes t relative , i s shorte r tha n th e corresponding phas e i n humans , an d th e postreproductiv e phas e appears t o be unique to humans.60 Perhaps th e most striking aspect of huma n development , though , is th e prolonge d period o f infanc y and childhood. Although the gestational period is also longer than in other primates , it is comparatively short relative to the other stages of development .
It ca n b e argue d i n fac t tha t huma n infant s ar e bor n prema turely.61 The newborns of other species of primate are relativel y well developed and capabl e at birth, while human newborns are as help-

This means that human babies ar e i n effec t embryo s fo r about th e first 9 months afte r the y are born. On e reason fo r the early birth o f humans i s probably me chanical. Our large heads make birth difficul t enoug h as it is, and t o delay birt h beyon d th e nine-mont h gestationa l period , whe n th e brain is undergoing rapid growth, would surely make it impossible. The size of the pelvic canal, through which the newbor n must pass, is als o limite d by th e structura l requirement s of bipedal walking.

The Human Condition 6

According to David Premack, human infant s are at a disadvantage relative t o apes an d monkey s onl y for the firs t 1 0 months followin g birth. Th e monkey infant i s better tha n th e ape, an d th e ape bette r than the human, on such skills as grasping an object, reaching for an object, or sitting up unassisted . Afte r 1 0 or 1 1 months, the superior ity of the huma n infan t begin s to assert itself. 62
There is some debate a s to when the prolonged infanc y that distinguishes human s fro m othe r primate s evolved . Pattern s o f denta l development provid e on e sourc e o f evidence. In apes , fo r instance, the three molar teet h appear a t ages 3.3, 6.6, and 10. 5 years, whereas in human s th e correspondin g age s ar e 6 , 12 , and 1 8 years. Give n a fossil specimen, one could therefor e theoreticall y determine the duration o f infancy i f one coul d relat e th e presenc e o f molar teet h t o the ag e o f the specime n a t death . I t ha s generall y been conclude d from evidenc e of this sort that eve n the earliest hominids resembled humans rather than apes with respect to the duration of infancy, but this conclusio n ha s recentl y bee n challenged . Th e difficult y i s t o determine the age of a fossil a t death . For instance, the Taung child, the fossi l A . africanus discovere d b y Raymon d Dart , wa s unti l recently assume d t o have bee n aroun d 6 years ol d a t death , bu t i t is now claimed tha t th e age was closer t o 3 years. This recent evidence suggests in fact that the dental patterns of A. africanus an d H. habilis were mor e ape-lik e tha n human-like , implying that th e prolonge d childhood o f our specie s evolve d after th e tim e of H. habilis.63
On th e othe r hand , ther e i s evidenc e tha t i t wa s presen t i n H . erectus. Judging fro m th e skeleto n o f th e 12-year-ol d boy foun d a t western Lak e Turkana and fro m othe r evidenc e on sex differences i n morphology, th e birt h cana l i n H. erectus was significantl y smalle r than that of H. sapiens, yet H. erectus grew to a size approaching that of moder n humans . Fran k Brow n an d hi s coauthors , wh o describ e the Lak e Turkan a skeleton , writ e tha t "b y 1. 6 [million years ] ago , the secondary altricia l conditio n (which leads t o increased feta l dependency) mus t hav e bee n present." 64 The best guess , then , is tha t the prolonged childhood tha t is a distinctively human characteristi c was a developmen t tha t too k plac e i n tha t narro w perio d o f time between H. habilis an d H. erectus.
The prolonged infanc y and childhoo d of humans has an especially marked influenc e on th e developmen t of the brain , and indeed , it is through prolonge d growt h rathe r tha n a n unusua l rat e o f growth than th e huma n brai n reache s it s exceptiona l size.65 Th e brains of many mammal s ar e essentiall y full y forme d at birth , an d i n othe r primates brai n developmen t extends int o earl y postnata l growth. The brain of a newborn chimpanzee is about 60 percent of its ultimate weight, while that of a newborn human is only 24 percent of that of an

adult. Moreover, during th e first quarter o f the period fro m birt h to puberty, the chimpanze e brai n increase s onl y 30 percent, while the human brain increase s 6 0 percent..66 Most of the growth of the human brain therefor e take s plac e afte r birth, when the child is exposed to the modifyin g influences of the environment , whereas th e brain s of apes are more tha n hal f developed at birth .

Neoteny
According to some, humans no t only take longer to grow up than do other primates , the y neve r actuall y mak e it . I n 1926 , the Dutc h anatomist Loui s Bolk listed some 20 ways in which the adult human retains child-lik e characteristics, a phenomeno n known as neoteny (which means "holdin g youth").67 At the embryonic stage, the skulls of apes and monkey s ar e ver y lik e ou r own , rounde d an d bulbous , with small jaws and teeth an d weak brow ridges. However, humans retain thes e characteristics , wherea s th e skull s of other primate s grow flatte r an d smalle r relativ e t o th e res t o f the body , and th e jaws, teeth , an d bro w ridge s gro w muc h mor e pronounced . Th e foramen magnum , th e hol e i n the skul l from whic h th e spina l cor d emerges, is at th e botto m o f the skul l in the embryos of most mam mals. In humans i t remains so , but in other mammals it migrates to the back o f the skul l s o that th e head become s tilte d relative to the spinal cord. There are other changes that occur in mammalian development, such as the backward rotatio n of the vaginal canal and th e sideways rotatio n o f the bi g toe , but i n human developmen t these features retain thei r embryonic form.
Such feature s sugges t tha t huma n growt h ma y b e retarded , a n idea explore d t o goo d effec t b y Aldou s Huxley in hi s nove l After Many a Summer. A character i n th e novel , the fifth Earl o f Gonister, has managed t o prolong his life and that of his lover well beyond 200 years b y ingestin g car p guts . However, this prolongatio n o f lif e i s achieved at a price, fo r the two aged lovers have grown into apes. So much for dreams o f immortality.
The concept o f neoteny is not withou t problems . Tha t w e should be ape s i s ba d enough , bu t t o sugges t tha t w e ar e retarde d ape s borders o n th e insulting . Nevertheless, the ide a ha s bee n defended by Stephe n Ja y Gould. 68 Som e o f ou r retarde d features , lik e th e position of the foramen magnum o r the non-opposable toe, are simply convenien t adaptation s t o ou r upright , two-legge d stance. The more interesting aspect has to do with the brain. The human brain is exceptional i n tha t i t continue s t o gro w lon g afte r birth , which is why the human skull retains its bulbous appearance. This may pro-

Genes versus Culture
From th e beginnin g o f homini d evolution , cultur e ha s playe d a prominent role , and indeed cultural an d biological evolution cannot always b e disentangled. Ralp h L . Holloway has argue d i n fact tha t the socia l componen t wa s paramoun t fro m th e beginning . "We are unique," he writes, "becaus e w e have evolved the capacit y t o alter our environment s t o a n exten t unprecedente d b y an y othe r crea ture."69 Activities such a s tool making , hunting, and gatherin g too k place i n a socia l context , so that hominid s effectivel y create d thei r own environments . Sinc e biologica l evolutio n consists o f adaptin g to th e environment , th e earl y hominid s bega n i n effec t t o contro l their own evolution. This mutual interactio n between biological and cultural evolution , accordin g t o Holloway , explain s th e rapi d changes that occurred in hominid evolution.
This i s also essentiall y th e poin t mad e b y Lumsden an d Wilson , the sociobiologists , when the y write of gene-culture coevolution.70 As we saw in Chapter 1 , however, these authors also make the controversial clai m tha t significan t geneti c change s ar e stil l occurrin g an d can tak e plac e withi n 5 0 generations. To me, i t i s more likel y that, genetically speaking , th e huma n conditio n wa s reache d wit h th e advent o f H. sapiens sapiens, an d th e significan t change s sinc e the n have been cultura l rathe r tha n genetic . The further question, however, i s whethe r th e gene-cultur e spira l wa s sufficien t eve n t o explain th e arriva l o f H. sapiens sapiens, o r whethe r ther e wa s som e sudden genetic shift , th e product of exaptation o r some hitch-hiking gene, that gave us our distinctive characteristics .
It is a curious fac t tha t th e increas e i n the siz e and complexit y of the human brai n i s achieved with very little genetic change. Chapter 2 noted th e clos e genetic similarity between humans an d chimpan zees. Eve n mor e remarkable , perhaps , th e tota l amoun t o f genetic information, a s coded i n the DN A molecule, has remaine d virtually constant throug h mammalian evolution . It ha s bee n estimated , i n fact, tha t th e numbe r o f genes i s abou t 1 million, whether i n th e mouse, th e cow , the chimpanzee , o r th e human . Moreover some 40 percent o f chromosomal DN A appears t o b e redundant , and i t ha s been estimated tha t there may be only about 10,00 0 genes available for constructing the brain and th e central nervous system.71
This number seems remarkably small when compared to the complexity o f the huma n brai n alone , which consists o f some 10 10 neu-

rons, and 10 14ssynapses (o r connections betwee n neurons). It there -

fore seem s likel y that th e vast complexity of the human brai n i s not

achieved solely by genetic coding, but i s determined in part by inter-

actions wit h th e environment . Thi s ma y be related, i n turn, t o the

long period of postnatal developmen t experienced by humans and t o

the closel y kni t famil y bond s tha t ensur e exposur e t o appropriat e

The idea tha t the human brai n i s distinguished from th e brains of other specie s b y it s plasticit y an d capacit y fo r learning has bee n a persistent one . Th e ver y notio n o f intelligenc e ha s ofte n bee n equated wit h th e abilit y t o learn , an d seemingl y cleve r behavio r from animal s ha s often bee n dismissed with the suggestion that it is merely instinctive . However , th e poin t i s a contentiou s on e an d raises a n issu e tha t goes bac k t o the early philosophers. On the one hand ther e i s a n associationis t doctrine , runnin g fro m Aristotle , through th e Britis h associationist s suc h a s Locke , t o th e moder n behaviorists, that the human min d is a tabula rasa at birth awaiting the imprin t o f experience. O n the othe r hand , ther e i s an idealisti c tradition goin g bac k t o Plato' s notio n o f pure ideas , resurfacin g in Kant's ide a o f a prior i knowledge , an d represente d toda y i n Chomsky's approach to language.
Perhaps th e most extrem e moder n idealis t is Jerry A. Fodor. In his 1983 book The Modularity o f Mind, h e conceived of the huma n mind as consisting largely of a set of independent, innately endowed modules, each dedicate d t o some specifi c computationa l function , suc h as the analysis of spoken speech or the segmentation of objects in the perception o f a visual scene .
Modern biolog y suggest s a compromise betwee n thes e extremes . James L . Gould and Pete r Marler write of "innately guided learning processes" that constrai n bot h th e typ e of learning tha t ma y occu r and th e developmental stag e at whic h it occurs.73 A good example of this is again supplie d b y song learnin g i n birds. The white-crowned sparrow learn s t o imitate songs , but i n order t o do so it must hea r the song before it i s 7 weeks old. (Unlike the canary, it gets only one chance; i t doe s no t lear n song s i n adulthood. ) Thi s perio d o f time during which the son g must b e heard i s known as the critical period for learning..74
There ar e man y other examples of learning that is constrained b y a critica l period , including , i t ha s bee n argued , huma n language . More generally, the questio n o f genetic versus cultural influences i s especially critical wit h respect t o the learning o f language, and wil l be discussed furthe r i n that contex t in Chapter 5.

According to E. S. Deevey, there hav e been three cultural "revolutions," each producin g a surge i n population followe d b y a leveling off towar d a state of equilibrium.75 The first of these had t o do with the developmen t o f tools an d th e sprea d o f population. From abou t 1 millio n t o 25,00 0 year s ago , th e tool-makin g revolution wa s ac companied b y th e sprea d o f populatio n fro m Afric a t o mos t o f Europe an d Asia , an d a n estimate d increas e i n tota l populatio n from abou t 125,00 0 t o somewha t ove r 3 million . As noted above , there ma y i n fac t hav e bee n tw o migration s fro m Africa , wit h th e later migratio n o f H. sapiens sapiens i n the las t 200,00 0 or s o years replacing th e earlie r archai c variety . By th e Mesolithi c Ag e some 10,000 year s ago , th e populatio n ha d sprea d als o t o th e America s and th e Pacific—ove r most o f the earth, i n fact—and had increase d to over 5 million.
Then came th e agricultural revolution , when hunters an d gatherers gav e wa y t o plowme n an d herdsmen , an d village s and town s developed. The population increase d b y an estimate d 16-fold , fro m somewhat ove r 5 millio n t o betwee n 8 0 an d 9 0 million , between 10,000 an d 600 0 year s ago , an d the n a t a slowe r rat e t o about 54 5 million about thre e centuries ago . The last three centuries have seen the scientific-industria l revolution, with anothe r shar p increas e i n population, said t o have reached 5 billion on 1 0 July 1987.
The population increase s brough t abou t b y each o f these revolutions wa s presumabl y du e i n par t t o increase s i n th e mean s o f subsistence. It has bee n estimated, fo r instance, that th e shif t fro m animal foo d t o plant foo d allows a 10-fol d increas e i n food pe r unit of are a eve n withou t agricultura l labor , an d th e scientific industrial revolutio n als o brough t abou t a dramati c shif t i n th e efficiency o f food production . Bu t th e increas e i n population is also due i n par t t o increasin g lif e expectancy .

There i s little reason t o believe that H. sapiens sapiens of 150,000 years ago differed genetically from thos e of today, at least with respect t o intelligence or adaptability, jus t a s ther e i s littl e reaso n t o suppos e tha t differen t racia l groups o f people toda y diffe r geneticall y i n thes e respects . Wher e modern human s i n industrialized societ y differ fro m thei r forebears is i n thei r vas t resource s o f technology an d information . Although language itself is a human universal , language also creates the critical conditions fo r a high degre e of specialization. Human s diversif y their knowledge and skill , so that societ y itself attains a complexity that i s well beyond the capacity o f the individual.

Summary
The mos t decisiv e even t i n huma n evolutio n was bipedalism . Precisely why the hominids stoo d an d walked upright i s still not clear. I have discussed conventiona l accounts, along with the controversial theory tha t bipedalism ma y have been an adaptation t o an aquatic phase durin g th e transitio n betwee n th e Pliocene and th e Miocene. The aquati c theor y ma y als o explai n th e peculia r sexua l habits of humans, although ou r obsessive sexuality may simply have been an adaptation t o the earl y hominids ' wandering, scavenging life style, which required clos e famil y bonds . The reader is , of course, free t o choose from amon g th e various scenarios, and may rest assured tha t the aquatic theor y wil l scarcely intrud e from thi s point on.
But whatever th e reaso n fo r bipedalism, i t allowed th e forelimb s to b e exapte d fo r othe r purposes , suc h a s manipulation , carryin g things, and making and using tools. However, the australopithecines do not seem t o have capitalized on the extra opportunities offered by bipedalism, but remained creature s wit h brains no larger than those of th e ape s an d eventuall y became extinct . The next decisive event may hav e bee n th e choic e o f survival strategy. With the goo d sens e to whic h w e hav e becom e accustomed , th e lin e tha t emerge d a s Homo ma y hav e scavenge d fo r meat, a strateg y tha t ma y hav e favored th e developmen t o f specialized stone tool s fo r scrapin g an d later cuttin g meat . Th e scavengin g lif e ma y als o hav e favore d a more cooperative societ y and mor e sophisticated ways of communicating, which would, in turn, favor an increase in brain size. In such a society, diversification might also have been an advantage, so that different individual s migh t b e specialize d t o d o differen t things . This may have favored a prolonged childhood, increasing the contribution of experience to th e shapin g of skills. In H. habilis, therefore , we see the beginnin g of the positiv e feedback loo p between biologi -

cal and cultura l changes , identifie d b y Holloway as the mechanism driving human evolution.
One thing no doubt led to another. The use of the hands for the use and manufactur e o f tools an d fo r communication woul d have ha d survival value of its own, but i t required cooperatio n an d communication betwee n differen t individuals , leading t o selectiv e pressur e for furthe r increase s i n brai n size . The developmen t o f tool s ma y also have free d th e mout h fro m som e o f its mor e arduou s dutie s in food consumption , permittin g it s involvemen t in th e evolutio n of oral language. The upright stance may also have eventually brought about change s i n th e shap e o f th e voca l trac t tha t coul d als o b e exploited in vocal communication. The evolution of language will be discussed i n more detai l in Chapter 6.
One o f th e issue s i n theorie s o f human evolutio n is whethe r w e
evolved gradually over the past 4 million or so years to become what we are , o r whethe r ther e wa s a relativel y sudde n change , a s suggested by the evolutionary explosion of the Upper Paleolithic.76 Holloway is representative o f the gradualist approach, althoug h control gained over th e environment would have speeded th e evolutionary process throughou t th e period of hominid development. That is, the positive feedbac k betwee n environmenta l an d biologica l chang e would n o doub t hav e create d a positivel y accelerating function , with both biological and cultural changes occurring more rapidly in recent time s compare d wit h earlie r times . This might explai n th e relative stagnation i n th e developmen t of tools from abou t 1. 8 million unti l abou t 200,00 0 year s ag o or later . Others , however, have suggested a discontinuit y i n evolutio n withi n th e las t 200,00 0 years.77 The argument fo r a discontinuity rests i n part on the evolutionary explosio n tha t occurre d som e 35,00 0 years ag o and i n part on the special natur e o f human language , which is held to represen t an abrupt chang e fro m othe r forms of animal communication. This issue will surface again i n later chapters .

Human Handedness
Mine hand als o hath lai d the foundatio n o f the earth, and my right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them, they stand up together.
ISAIAH 48:1 3
IN OUTWAR D APPEARANCE, huma n being s are bilaterall y symmetrical, as are most other animals. Except perhaps fo r the parting of the hair or a twisted smile , each sid e of the body seems t o be almost exactly the mirror image of the other side. As we shall see, however, this is a deceptive impression , sinc e ther e ar e man y asymmetrie s tha t lur k beneath th e surface .
We share some o f these asymmetrie s wit h other species , but tw o are o f particular relevanc e t o th e them e o f this boo k because the y seem t o single out huma n being s as being different. Th e most obvious asymmetry i s that th e great majorit y of human beings are righthanded. Less obvious, but n o less striking, is the functional asymmetry of the huma n brain . Thi s asymmetry is manifest i n a number of ways, the most compellin g of which is that in most of us the lef t sid e of the brai n control s speech . It i s also dominant fo r other aspect s of language, includin g readin g an d writing . Could these asymmetrie s hold the key to our uniqueness ?
Before considerin g th e evidenc e o n thes e matters , I shoul d not e that asymmetr y itsel f i s no criterio n fo r uniqueness or superiority. The very molecules o f which al l animal s ar e constructe d ar e asym metrical, and interna l organ s suc h as the heart, stomach, and live r are asymmetricall y placed , leadin g th e eminen t biologist Jacques Monod to remark that "our outwardly 'bilateral' appearance is some-

thing o f a fake." 1 Eve n outwardly , many primitiv e organisms ar e manifestly mor e asymmetrica l tha n humans , a s Fleu r Adcoc k eloquently expressed i n her poem Last Song:2

Goodbye, sweet symmetry . Goodbye, sweet world of mirror-images an d matchin g halves, where animals usually have four legs and people nearly always have two; where birds and bats and butterflie s can fl y straight i f they try. Goodbye to one-a-side for eyes and ears and arm s and breasts and balls and shoulder blades and hands; goodbye to the straight line drawn dow n the central spine, making us double in a world where oddness is acceptable only under th e sea, for the lop-sided lobster, the wonky oyster, the creepily rotated flatfish wit h both eyes over one gill; goodbye to the swee t certitudes of our mammalian order , where to be born wit h one eye or three thumb s points t o not being human. It will come.

In the next world, when this one's gone skew-whiff , we shall be algae or lichen, things we've hardly even needed to pronounce. If the flounde r still exists it will be king.

Far fro m bein g a natura l biologica l state, bilatera l symmetr y is itself a n evolutionar y adaptation . T o freel y movin g animals , th e world i s essentially indifferen t wit h respec t t o lef t an d right ; ther e are no pressures or contingencies that should make us more respon sive to one side or the other. Limbs are symmetrically placed so that movement, whether achieved by running, swimming, or flying, may proceed i n a straight line . Any asymmetry in legs or wings would be likely to cause an animal or bird t o proceed i n fruitless (and perhaps meatless) circles. Sense organs, such as the eyes, ears, and nostrils, are symmetrically placed s o that we may be equally alert t o either side. Those parts of the brai n an d centra l nervou s syste m tha t ar e concerned wit h thes e function s mirror th e symmetr y o f the func tions themselves.
Symmetry, however , i s readil y abandone d i f asymmetr y proves more adaptive. To a flounder a t th e botto m o f the sea , lying flat on
its side, survival is more likel y if the tw o eyes gaze upward from th e

same sid e of the bod y than i f one of them i s forever doomed to star e at the blackness of the ocean bed. Similarly, the asymmetrical placement o f the interna l organ s o f the bod y n o doub t allow s for mor e efficient packaging , and ther e i s no survival value to be gained fro m bilateral symmetry i n such matters .
What i s potentiall y interestin g abou t huma n handednes s an d cerebral asymmetr y i s that the y represent asymmetrie s i n systems that ha d presumabl y bee n largel y symmetrica l i n ou r ancestors . Again, thi s i s no t unique—th e eye s o f th e flounde r provid e an other example—bu t it doe s sugges t a possibl e basi s fo r a discontinuity betwee n human s an d othe r primates . Moreover , th e func tions t o whic h thos e asymmetrie s apply , namel y manipulatio n and speech , see m themselve s t o bea r somethin g o f th e stuf f o f human uniqueness .
Let me begin, then, with handedness .

The Nature of Huma n Handedness
Nearly 90 percent o f humans ar e right-handed . That is , they prefer the right hand for most task s requiring a single hand, and th e right hand dominate s i n tasks involvin g both hands, such a s unscrewin g the lid of a jar. Those who prefer to use a particular hand ar e nearly always more skillfu l wit h that hand , suggesting that relative preference is determined b y relative proficiency. 3 Th e difference i n skill is quite strikin g i n activitie s suc h a s writing , drawing , throwing , o r playing games suc h as tennis or squash .
There are , o f course , individua l variations . Som e peopl e prefe r different hand s for different activities , and a fe w are ambidextrou s rather tha n right - or left-handed . It i s possible t o construct wha t is called a laterality quotient fro m a compariso n o f right - wit h left hand preference s o n variou s task s though t t o b e representativ e o f human manua l activities . On e widel y use d inventor y is shown i n Table 4.1, along with instructions for scoring. Although instruments such a s thi s revea l mor e o r les s continuou s gradation s o f handedness fro m extrem e righ t t o extrem e left , th e quotient s ar e heavily skewed towar d extrem e right-handedness , an d individual s tend t o fall toward one or the other extrem e rather than in the middle of the range.
It is sometimes claime d tha t handedness i s not unitary, but rather that hand preference s o n different cluster s o f activities are relatively independent o f on e another . Fo r example , i t ha s bee n foun d tha t hand preferenc e o n skille d activities , such a s th e us e o f tools , is distinct fro m tha t o n unskille d activities, such a s picking up eithe r

Preferenc e o n two handed activities, such as using an axe or a baseball bat, may constitute anothe r dimension. 4 Bu t regardles s o f whether handednes s is viewed as a single entity or as a cluster of dimensions, the overriding fact i s that th e righ t han d i s the dominan t or preferred on e in th e
great majorit y o f people. At least superficially, astriking aspect of handedness is the discrep-
ancy betwee n structur e and function . As the French anthropologis t Robert Hertz , in an essa y first published in 1909 , exclaimed: "What resemblance i s more perfec t tha n tha t betwee n the tw o hands! And yet wha t a strikin g difference ther e is!" 5 That is , the tw o hands ar e physically almos t perfect mirror image s of one another, but i n performance they are very different.

tional asymmetr y ma y explai n th e symboli c potenc y o f lef t an d right. Almost universally, the right sid e ha s been see n as sacred an d the lef t sid e a s profane. 6 W e need loo k no furthe r tha n th e Bibl e to find examples, as in Matthew 5:25:

And He shall set the sheep upon His right hand and the goats upon His left. Then shall the Kin g say to those upon His right, "Come ye blessed of m y Father , an d inheri t th e kingdo m prepare d fo r yo u fro m th e beginning of the world. " . . . Then shall He also say to those on the left , "Depart fro m me , y e accursed, int o everlasting fire prepared fo r th e Devil and hi s angels."

Table 4.2 Questions to Asses s Hand, Foot, Eye, andEar Preference

Hand Preference 1. Wit h whic h hand would you throw a ball t o hit a target ? 2. Wit h which han d do you draw? 3. Wit h whic h hand do you use an eraser on paper ? 4. Wit h which han d do you give out th e top card when dealing ? Foot Preference \. Wit h whic h foot d o you kick a ball? 2. I f you wanted t o pick u p a pebble wit h you r toes, whic h foo t would yo u use ? 3. I f you had t o step up ont o a chair, which foo t would yo u place on the chai r
first? Eye Preference 1. Whic h ey e would you use t o peep through a keyhole ? 2. I f you had t o loo k int o a dar k bottle to see how ful l i t was, whic h ey e would yo u
use? 3. Whic h eye would you use t o sight down a rifle ? Ear Preference 1. I f you wanted t o listen i n on a conversation goin g o n behind a closed door,
which ea r would you place against the door? 2. I f you wanted to hear someone's heart beat, which ea r woul d yo u place against
the chest? 3. Int o which ear woul d you place the earphone of a transistor radio?

Some Related and Unrelated Asymmetries

Besides handedness , ther e ar e othe r latera l biase s tha t ar e easil y

observable in most people. For example, most of us like to kick a ball

with th e righ t foo t o r loo k through a telescop e wit h th e righ t eye .

These asymmetries ar e rathe r les s pronounce d tha n i s handedness.

To assess th e proportion s showin g a right-side d preferenc e for th e

hand, foot, eye, and ear , Clare Porac an d Stanle y Coren asked mor e

than 500 0 individual s th e question s liste d i n Tabl e 4.2, and foun d

the percentages favorin g the right to be 88.2 for handedness, 81.0 for footedness, 71.1 for eyedness, and 59. 1 for earedness.8

They als o foun d that thes e biase s tende d to be congruent, that is ,

that th e preferred sid e on one measure tende d to be the same as the

preferred sid e on another. Fo r example, 84 percent showe d th e same

preference (lef t o r right ) for th e han d an d foot . Th e percentag e of

congruence was lowe r for the other pairing s and lowest of all for the

ear an d eye , where onl y 61.8 percent preferre d th e sam e side . In a

sense it is not surprising t o find congruence, since in each case ther e

is an overall bias in favor of the right side , and even if two measure s

It seems likely , then, that thes e various asymmetries reflect som e common underlyin g bias , bu t tha t th e expressio n o f th e bia s i s
strongest i n handedness . Thu s th e Britis h psychologis t Maria n Annett note s fro m severa l survey s tha t som e 9 5 percen t o f righthanders ar e right-footed , compared wit h abou t one-thir d o f left handers..10 Eyednes s is mor e weakl y relate d to handedness ; abou t two-thirds o f right-hander s ar e right-eyed , compared wit h abou t one-half o f left-handers . In general , left-hander s see m t o b e mor e mixed tha n right-hander s with respec t t o other asymmetries . This includes cerebral dominanc e fo r language, which will b e discussed in Chapters 7 and 8 .
Some asymmetries d o not seem t o be related t o handedness at all, although i t i s often suppose d tha t the y are. For example, most peo-
ple clasp their hands with the left thum b on top, but this seems to be equally tru e o f right- an d left-handers . In a surve y of students i n large classe s i n undergraduat e psychology , Marian Annet t foun d that slightl y more left-hander s (62 percent) than right-hander s (54 percent) claspe d thei r hand s thi s way , but th e differenc e wa s no t statistically reliable . Similarly , about 5 9 percent folde d thei r arm s with th e lef t ar m o n top, about 7 5 percent parted thei r hair o n the left, and about 6 5 percent had a clockwise hair whorl, but right- and left-handers di d no t diffe r reliabl y in these respects.
One asymmetr y tha t i s relate d t o handednes s i s cerebral domi nance for language. This relation will be discussed further in Chapter 8 , where I shall try t o develop a unified vie w of human laterality.

The universality of Huma n Handedness
Andrew Buchanan, i n th e Proceedings of th e Philosophical Society of Glasgow of 1860—1864 , was bol d enough t o write as follows :
The use of the right hand in preference t o the lef t mus t be regarded as a general characteristic of the famil y o f man. There is no nation, race, or trib e o f me n o n th e eart h at th e presen t day , among who m th e preference does not obtain; while, in former times , it is shown to have existed, both b y historical document s an d b y th e stil l mor e an d au thentic testimon y o f certain words , phrases , and mode s of speaking, which are, I believe, to be found i n every spoken language.11
This assertion hold s as true today as it did in Buchanan's time. There ar e occasiona l suggestion s that some nation or race of peo-
ple ma y hav e bee n predominantl y left-handed, bu t th e evidenc e is typically indirec t and fail s t o withstan d closer scrutiny . For example, i n a popula r articl e writte n i n 1956 , Trevor Holloway asserts

that "th e Antanalas of Madagascar ar e uniqu e amon g th e race s of

the worl d fo r almos t ever y membe r o f this trib e o f 100,00 0 is left handed."12 I have bee n abl e t o find no basis fo r this extraordinar y

claim.

It has also been argued tha t th e ancient Hebrews must have been mostly left-hande d because Hebre w i s writte n fro m righ t t o left. 13

But s o are a lot of other scripts. U p to about 150 0 A.D. there were in

fact abou t a s many right-to-left scripts a s left-to-right ones , and th e

gradual predominance o f left-to-right script s i s probably du e to historical factor s unconnecte d wit h handedness. 14 Althoug h i t ma y

seem more "natural " for the right-hander t o write from lef t t o right,

this applie s primaril y t o cursive script, an d i s in any event due in

part t o th e fac t tha t mos t o f us hav e bee n taugh t tha t way . To the

ancients who formed symbols by engraving them on stone tablets, it

may hav e bee n mor e natura l t o start o n the right , simpl y becaus e

that is the side of the preferred hand .

It was once commonl y believe d tha t th e ancien t Egyptian s were

predominantly left-hande d becaus e the y usuall y depicted human s

and animal s i n righ t profile , whereas i t i s mor e natura l fo r right-

handers t o dra w lef t profile s (that is , with th e lef t sid e facin g th e

viewer). Figure 4. 1 shows a typical example of a person depicte d in

right profile from an Egyptia n tomb relie f dated a t abou t 3,50 0 B.C.

But notic e that th e person himself is evidently right-handed, for he

is holding a stylus in his right hand. A survey has in fact shown that,

despite th e predominanc stances of right-hand use

rable to that observed in modern societies. 15 The preference for right

profiles ma y simpl y reflec t a widesprea d cultura l belie f tha t th e

right sid e i s sacre d an d th e lef t sid e profane , a dichotom y tha t i s

itself a manifestation of the universalit y of right-handedness.

Against thes e isolate d claim s fo r los t tribe s o f left-handers , the

evidence for universal right-handednes s i s overwhelming. It come s

not just fro m th e measuremen t o r even the observatio n o f handed-

ness but i s woven into virtually all human culture s i n their myths,

their superstitions, and eve n their languages. The preference for the

right han d i s manifes t i n th e positiv e value s associate d wit h th e

right and the negative values associated wit h the left. In the Pythago-

rean Tabl e of Opposites, recorded b y Aristotle, the right was associ -

ated wit h th e limited , the odd, th e one, th e male, th e straight, the

light, and th e good, while the left wa s linked with the unlimited, the

even, th e many , the female , the curved , the dark , an d th e evil . Re-

markably similar tables can be drawn up fro m th e symbols of quite unrelated cultures.16

bolic potenc y o f lef t an d right , an d s o o f th e universalit y of right-

handedness. The right han d i s used fo r shaking hands, makin g the

sign o f the cross , saluting , laying on of hands, and swearin g on th e

Bible, while th e lef t han d i s the "han d o f the privy " and th e han d

that traditionally delivers the coup de grace to a dying opponent. We

speak o f a "right-han d man " bu t a "left-hande d compliment. " Th e

terms "adroit " an d "dexterous " hav e positiv e connotations, while

"gauche" and "sinister " have decidedly negative overtones.

Given th e negativ e association s wit h th e left , i t i s not surprisin g

that th e left-hande d have ofte n bee n victim s of abuse an d persecu -

tion. I n man y cultures , left-hander s hav e bee n force d t o change ,

especially fo r activitie s lik e eatin g an d writing . Accordin g t o

Barsley, th e left-hande r ha s bee n largel y "emancipated " i n Nort h

fo r Oriental school children living in the United cultural pressure ha s bee n relaxed. In a study of

schoolchildren in Japan, 7.2 percent were non-right-handed, but this

figure rose to 1 1 percent if those who had change d their handedness from lef t t o righ t wer e included. 2.3 Th e proportion s usin g th e lef t

hand fo r writing an d eatin g wer e onl y 0.7 and 1. 7 percent, respec -

tively, again showing the strong cultural pressure.

In Australia and Ne w Zealand, the percentage of individuals writ-

changes reflec t a n increase d toleranc e o f left-handers . The emer -

left-handed scissor s and corkscrews, indicates a new awareness that

left-handers d o have special problems in a world largely constructed

by and for right-handers .

It i s sometimes argue d tha t huma n right-handednes s is du e en-
