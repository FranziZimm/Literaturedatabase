The Evolutionary Emergence of Language
Language has no counterpart in the animal world. Unique to Homo sapiens, it appears inseparable from human nature. But how, when and why did it emerge? The contributors to this volume – linguists, anthropologists, cognitive scientists and others – adopt a modern Darwinian perspective to offer a bold synthesis of the human and natural sciences. As a feature of human social intelligence, language evolution is driven by biologically anomalous levels of social cooperation. Phonetic competence correspondingly reﬂects social pressures for vocal imitation, learning and other forms of social transmission. Distinctively human social and cultural strategies gave rise to the complex syntactic structure of speech. This book, presenting language as a remarkable social adaptation, testiﬁes to the growing inﬂuence of evolutionary thinking in contemporary linguistics. It will be welcomed by all those interested in human evolution, evolutionary psychology, linguistic anthropology and general linguistics.

Language: A Darwinian Adaptation?
CHRIS KNIGHT, MICHAEL STUDDERT-KENNEDY AND JAMES R. HURFORD
Let me just ask a question which everyone else who has been faithfully attending these sessions is surely burning to ask. If some rules you have described constitute universal constraints on all languages, yet they are not learned, nor are they somehow logically necessary a priori, how did language get that way?
Stevan Harnad, in a conference question to Noam Chomsky (Harnad, Steklis and Lancaster 1976: 57)
As a feature of life on earth, language is one of science’s great remaining mysteries. A central difﬁculty is that it appears so radically incommensurate with nonhuman systems of communication as to cast doubt on standard neo-Darwinian accounts of its evolution by natural selection. Yet scientiﬁc (as opposed to religious or philosophical) arguments for a discontinuity between human and animal communication have come into prominence only over the past 40 years. As long as behaviourism dominated anglophone psychology and linguistics, the transition from animal calls to human speech seemed to offer no particular difﬁculty (see, for example, Mowrer 1960; Skinner 1957). But the generative revolution in linguistics, begun with the publication of Noam Chomsky’s Syntactic Structures in 1957 and developed in many subsequent works (e.g. Chomsky 1965, 1966, 1972, 1975, 1986; Chomsky and Halle 1968) radically altered our conception of language, and posed a challenge to evolutionary theory that we are still striving to meet.
The central goal of Chomsky’s work has been to formalise, with mathematical rigour and precision, the properties of a successful grammar, that is, of a device for producing all possible sentences, and no impossible sentences, of a particular language. Such a grammar, or syntax, is autonomous with respect to both the meaning of a sentence and the physical structures (sounds, script, manual signs) that convey it; it is a purely formal system for arranging words

(or morphemes) into a pattern that a native speaker would judge to be grammatically correct, or at least acceptable. Chomsky has demonstrated that the logical structure of such a grammar is very much more complex and difﬁcult to formulate than we might suppose, and that its descriptive predicates (syntactic categories, phonological classes) are not commensurate with those of any other known system in the world, or in the mind. Moreover, the underlying principle, or logic, of a syntactic rule system is not immediately given on the surface of the utterances that it determines (Lightfoot, this volume), but must somehow be inferred from that surface – a task that may defeat even professional linguists and logicians. Yet every normal child learns its native language, without special guidance or reinforcement from adult companions, over the ﬁrst few years of life, when other seemingly simpler analytic tasks are well beyond its reach.
To account for this remarkable feat, Chomsky (1965, 1972) proposed an innate ‘language acquisition device’, including a schema of the ‘universal grammar’ (UG) to which, by hypothesis, every language must conform. The schema, a small set of principles, and of parameters that take different values in different languages, is highly restrictive, so that the child’s search for the grammar of the language it is learning will not be impossibly long. Specifying the parameters of UG, and their values in different languages, both spoken and signed, remains an ongoing task for the generative enterprise.
By placing language in the individual mind / brain rather than in the social group to which the individual belongs, Chomsky broke with the Saussurean and behaviouristic approaches that had prevailed in anglophone linguistics and psychology during the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century. At the same time, by returning language to its Cartesian status as a property of mind (or reason) and a deﬁning property of human nature (Chomsky 1966), Chomsky reopened language to psychological and evolutionary study, largely dormant since The Descent of Man (Darwin 1871).
We have no reason to suppose that Chomsky actually intended to revive such studies. For although he views linguistics as a branch of psychology, and psychology as a branch of biology, he sees their goals as quite distinct. The task of the linguist is to describe the structure of language much as an anatomist might describe that of a biological organ such as the heart; indeed, Chomsky has conceptualised language as in essence the output of a unitary organ or ‘module’, hard-wired in the human brain. The complementary role of the psychologist is to elucidate language function and its development in the individual, while physiologists, neurologists and psychoneurologists chart its underlying structures and mechanisms. As for the evolutionary debate, Chomsky has had little to offer other than his doubts concerning the likely role of natural selection in shaping the structure of language. This scepticism evidently stems, in part, from

the belief (shared with many other linguists, e.g. Bickerton 1990 and Jackendoff 1994) that language is not so much a system of communication, on which social selection pressures might indeed have come to bear, as it is a system for mental representation and thought. In any event, Chomsky has conspicuously left to others the social, psychological and biological issues that his work has raised.
The ﬁrst to take up the challenge was Eric Lenneberg (1967). His book (to which Chomsky contributed an appendix on ‘The formal nature of language’) is still among the most biologically sophisticated, thoughtful and stimulating introductions to the biology of language. Lenneberg drew on a mass of clinical, comparative and evolutionary data to construct a theory of epigenetic development, according to a relatively ﬁxed maturational schedule, with ‘critical periods’ for the development of speech and language. Lenneberg saw language as a self-contained biological system, with characteristic perceptual, motoric and cognitive modes of action; for its evolution he proposed a discontinuity theory, intended to be compatible both with developmental biology and with the newly recognised unique structure of language.
Other researchers were less willing to accept a gap in the evolutionary record. Indeed, it was apparently concern with the discontinuity implicit in the new linguistics that prompted the New York Academy of Sciences in 1976 to sponsor a multidisciplinary, international conference entitled ‘Origins and Evolution of Language and Speech’. In his opening remarks at the conference, Stevan Harnad observed:
Virtually all aspects of our relevant knowledge have changed radically since the nineteenth century. Our concept of language is totally altered and has become both more profound and more complex. The revolution in linguistics due to Noam Chomsky has provided a very different idea of what the nature of the ‘target’ for the evolutionary process might actually be. (Harnad, Steklis and Lancaster 1976: 1)
While assembling many diverse and often still useful contributions on virtually every topic that might conceivably bear on the evolution of language, the conference did little to meet the challenge it had undertaken to address. In fact, its main achievement was to reveal the ﬁerce recalcitrance of the problem, and the need for a more sharply focused attack on the evolution of linguistic form.
Such an attack came ﬁrst from Derek Bickerton (1981, 1990, 1995, 1998), a linguist and an expert on pidgins and creoles. Bickerton has been at the controversial center of discussions on language evolution for nearly twenty years, and several aspects of his work deserve comment. First is his contribution to the continuity/discontinuity debate. Our difﬁculties arise, according to Bickerton, because we have focused too heavily on communication instead of on more

basic systems of underlying representation. Natural selection favours increasingly complex systems of perceiving and representing the world. This is because enhanced sensitivity to aspects of the environment predictably affords an animal advantages over its fellows (cf. Ulbaek 1998). Eventually, however, curiosity, attention and long-term memory reach a point of development such that any further gain in knowledge of the world can come only from more complex representation, and this is what language provides. ‘Language . . . is not even primarily a means of communication. Rather it is a system of representation, a means for sorting and manipulating the plethora of information that deluges us throughout our waking life’ (Bickerton 1990: 5).
How and when did the new representational system arise? According to Bickerton, the ﬁrst step was taken by Homo erectus somewhere between 1.5 million and ﬁve hundred thousand years ago. This was the step from primatestyle vocalizing into ‘protolanguage’, a system of arbitrary vocal reference that called only ‘for some kind of label to be attached to a small number of preexisting concepts’ (Bickerton 1990: 128). Bickerton’s protolanguage is a phylogenetic precursor of true language that is recapitulated in the child (cf. Lamendella 1976), and can be elicited by training from the chimpanzee. Speakers (or signers) of a protolanguage have a referential lexicon, but essentially no grammatical items and no syntax. Bickerton justiﬁes the concept of protolanguage as a unitary mode of representation, peculiar to our species, because it emerges, naturally and in essentially identical forms, through mere exposure to words. This happens not only in children under age two, but also in older children deprived of language during the ‘critical period,’ and even in adults obliged to communicate in a second language of which they know only a few words. The pidgins of the Caribbean and the Paciﬁc, and of Russian and Scandinavian sailors in the Norwegian Sea, are adult forms of protolanguage.
The ﬁnal step, the emergence of syntax in anatomically modern Homo sapiens, is more problematic. In his ﬁrst book, Roots of Language (1981), Bickerton argued for the gradual evolution of a syntactic ‘bioprogram’, a dynamic, epigenetic process according to which language unfolds in the child, guided by the ambient language. He stressed that ‘evolution has advanced not by leaps and bounds, but by inﬁnitesimal gradations’ (Bickerton 1981: 221). In his second book, however, Bickerton (1990: 177ff.) was troubled by logical difﬁculties in conceiving an ‘interlanguage’ that might have mediated between protolanguage and full language. He abandoned his gradualist bioprogram in favor of Chomskyan UG, and proposed a saltationist account of its origin. To support this account he drew on three main lines of evidence. First was fossil evidence for a sudden increase in the hominid ‘tool kit’ (bladed tools, cave paintings, stone ﬁgurines, lunar calendars and other artefacts) at the ‘erectus-sapiens interface’,

without any corresponding increase in brain size. Second were studies of child development, including the emergence of syntactically structured creole languages out of structureless pidgins in a single generation. Third was evidence, from the distribution of mitochondrial DNA in modern populations, that all modern humans descend from one female who lived in Africa about 220,000 (± 70,000) years ago (Cann, Stoneking and Wilson 1987). Bickerton proposed this female as the carrier of a single ‘crucial mutation’ that, in a catastrophic cascade of sequelae, reshaped the skull, altered the form of the vocal tract and rewired the brain (1990: 196).
Prominent archaeological contributors to debates on the evolution of ‘modern’ behaviour (e.g. Klein 1995; Mellars 1991, 1998) endorsed the notion of some such genetically based cognitive leap. But among evolutionary biologists Bickerton’s syntax-generating macromutation met with incredulity and a barrage of forceful criticism. In response Bickerton (this volume) has moderated his position to allow for a slower, though still rapid, process of genetic assimilation through cumulative ‘Baldwin effects’ (Baldwin 1896). On this account, syntax emerged by cognitive exaptation of thematic roles (Agent, Theme, Goal) that had already evolved in the service of a social calculus of reciprocal altruism.
Criticism of Bickerton’s saltationist Darwinism doubtless owed much of its vigour and conﬁdence to a change in intellectual climate precipitated by the ‘selﬁsh gene’ revolution in the life sciences (Hamilton 1964; Trivers 1971; Dawkins 1976). Notice of the impact of this revolution on linguistics was served by Steven Pinker and Paul Bloom, who broke the barrier between generative linguistics and language evolution with a widely discussed article entitled ‘Natural language and natural selection’ (Pinker and Bloom 1990). In this article, they portrayed the human language faculty (speciﬁcally, the capacity for generative grammar) as a biological adaptation that could be explained in standard neo-Darwinian terms (see also Newmeyer 1991). Appearing in a respected and widely read interdisciplinary journal, Behavioral and Brain Sciences, the article situated language evolution for the ﬁrst time as a legitimate topic within the natural science mainstream, prompting a debate that has continued to this day.
In championing gradualist Darwinian adaptationism against the scepticism of Chomsky and others, Pinker and Bloom in fact set themselves a modest agenda. They attributed the language module to unspeciﬁed selection pressures whose onset they traced to the Australopithecine stage. They exempted themselves from having to offer a more precise or testable theory by arguing that Darwinians need not address the emergence of novelty, being required only to provide evidence that a novel adaptation – once it has emerged – confers ﬁtness. The two authors therefore by their own admission said ‘virtually nothing’ (Pinker and Bloom 1990: 765) about language origins. They were satisﬁed

Knight, Studdert-Kennedy and Hurford

with having established language as a biological adaptation, its evolution falling within the remit of standard Darwinian theory.
We may easily suppose that the evolution of language is unproblematic since it seems so beneﬁcial to all. Indeed, as Nettle (1999a: 216) has pointed out, Pinker and Bloom in their seminal paper clearly take this view:
[There is] an obvious advantage to being able to acquire information second-hand: by tapping into the vast reservoir of knowledge accumulated by other individuals, one can avoid having to duplicate the possibly time-consuming and dangerous trialand-error process that won that knowledge. (1990: 712)
For a strategy to evolve, however, it must not only increase ﬁtness, but also be evolutionarily stable. That is, there must be no alternative strategy which gives competitors higher ﬁtness. In the case of information exchange, there are such strategies: individuals who deceive others in order to further their own interests, or who ‘freeload’ – enjoying the beneﬁts of cooperation without paying the costs – will, under most circumstances, have higher ﬁtness than those abiding by the social contract (Nettle 1999a: 216). In the light of what we know about the ‘Machiavellian’ manipulative and deceptive strategies of the great apes (Byrne and Whiten 1988), it is far from self-evident that reliance on second-hand information would have been a viable strategy for early hominids. Or rather, unless there were additional mechanisms to ensure against cheating on contractual understandings, it would seem that language could not have been adaptive (Nettle 1999a; Knight 1998; Power 1998, this volume). We return to this point.
Pinker and Bloom dated language to some two to four million years ago, arguing that it allowed hominids to share memories, agree on joint plans and pool knowledge concerning, say, the whereabouts of food. Built into this model was the assumption that something resembling the lifestyle of extant huntergatherers was already being established during the Plio-Pleistocene. Such an approach has one clear advantage: it apparently allows sufﬁcient time for slow, gradualist evolution of the posited complex module. However, palaeolithic archaeologists have been unable to conﬁrm claimed evidence for hunter-gatherer levels of cooperation among Australopithecine or other early hominids. Even as brain size exceeded the ape range, corresponding lifestyles seem to have remained essentially primate-like: Homo erectus males may have been relatively competent hunters and scavengers, but they were not provisioning dependents with hunted meat carried back to base camps (O’Connell et al. 1999). If these hominids had ‘language’, then it seems remarkable how little its effects show up in the archaeological record, which affords no evidence for home bases, logistically planned hunting, personal ornamentation, art or ritually enforced

social contracts until late in the Pleistocene (Bickerton 1990; Binford 1989; Knight 1991; Mithen 1996, 1999; Stringer and Gamble 1993).
While these debates were under way, primatologist Robin Dunbar (1993, 1996) intervened with a substantially novel methodology and explanatory framework. In work conducted jointly with palaeontologist Leslie Aiello (Aiello and Dunbar 1993), he correlated language evolution with the fossil record for rapid neocortical expansion in Homo sapiens, dating key developments to between 400,000 and 250,000 years ago. For the ﬁrst time, this work speciﬁed concrete Darwinian selection pressures driving language evolution. The outcome was a model consistent with primatological theory and testable in the light of palaeontological and archaeological data.
Dunbar (1993) set out from the observation that primates maintain social bonds by manual grooming. Besides being energetically costly, this allows only one individual to be addressed at a time; it also occupies both hands, precluding other activities such as foraging or feeding. As group size in humans increased, multiplying the number of relationships each individual had to monitor, this method of servicing relationships became increasingly difﬁcult to afford. According to Dunbar (1993), the cheaper method of ‘vocal grooming’ was the solution. Reliance on vocalisation not only freed the hands, allowing simultaneous foraging and other activities, but also enabled multiple partners to be ‘groomed’ at once.
For Dunbar, the switch from manual to vocal grooming began with the appearance of Homo erectus, around two million years ago. At this early stage, vocalisations were not meaningful in any linguistic sense but were experienced as intrinsically rewarding, much like the contact-calls of geladas and other primates. Then from around four hundred thousand years ago, with the emergence of archaic Homo sapiens in Africa, ‘vocalisations began to acquire meaning’ (Dunbar 1996: 115). Once meaning had arrived, the human species possessed language. But it was not yet ‘symbolic language’. It could enable gossip, but still fell short of allowing reference to ‘abstract concepts’ (Dunbar 1996: 116). Language in its modern sense – as a system for communicating abstract thought – emerged only later, in association with anatomically modern humans. According to Dunbar, this late reﬁnement served novel functions connected with complex symbolic culture including ritual and religion.
Dunbar’s account left many questions unanswered. Darwinians have recently come to understand that the discernible costliness of animal signals underscores their reliability (Zahavi 1987, 1993; Zahavi and Zahavi 1997). This requires us to build into Dunbar’s model some way of explaining how the low-cost vocalisations which we term ‘words’ could have replaced costly manual grooming in signalling commitment to alliance partners (Power 1998). We also need to

8

Knight, Studdert-Kennedy and Hurford

explain language’s most remarkable, distinctive and unprecedented feature – its dual hierarchical structure of phonology and syntax. Instead of highlighting such challenges, Dunbar sought to minimise them by suggesting continuity with primate vocal communication. For example, he pictured the vocal signalling of vervet monkeys as ‘an archetypal protolanguage’, already incipiently speechlike. These monkeys, in Dunbar’s view, are almost speaking when they emit ‘quite arbitrary’ sounds in referring to ‘speciﬁc objects’. Grammar, argues Dunbar, is present long before human language, being central to primate cognition including social intelligence (cf. Bickerton, this volume). Dunbar has not addressed the problem of how ‘meanings’ came to be attached to previously content-free vocalisations; he glosses this development as a ‘small step’ not requiring special explanation (1996: 141). Nor does he see any theoretical difﬁculty in his scenario of premodern humans ‘gossiping’ in the absence of ‘symbolism’, their vocalisations counting as ‘language’ even though not permitting ‘reference to abstract concepts’.
For psychologist Merlin Donald (1991, 1998) and for neuroscientist Terrence Deacon (1997), by contrast, the question of how humans, given their nonsymbolic primate heritage, came to represent their knowledge in symbolic form is the central issue in the evolution of language. The emergence of words as carriers of symbolic reference – without which syntax would be neither possible nor necessary – is the threshold of language. Establishment of this basic speech system, with its high-speed phonetic machinery, specialised memory system and capacity for vocal imitation – all unique to humans – then becomes ‘a necessary step in the evolution of human linguistic capacity’ (Donald 1991: 236; cf. Deacon 1997: ch. 8).
What selective pressures drove the evolution of the speech system? Donald (1991) starts from the assumption that the modern human mind is a hybrid of its past embodiments, still bearing ‘the indelible stamp of [its] lowly origin’ (Darwin 1871: 920). Much as Bickerton takes the structureless word strings of modern pidgins as evidence for a protolanguage, Donald ﬁnds evidence for a prelinguistic mode of communication in the gestures, facial expressions, pantomimes and inarticulate vocalisations to which modern humans may have recourse when deprived of speech. ‘Mimesis’ is Donald’s term for this analog, largely iconic, mode of communication and thought. The mode requires a conscious, intentional control of emotionally expressive behaviours, including vocalisation, that is beyond the capacity of other primates. We are justiﬁed in regarding mimesis, like Bickerton’s protolanguage, as a unitary mode of representation, peculiar to our species, not only because it emerges naturally, independent of and dissociable from language, in deaf and aphasic humans unable to speak, but also because it still forms the basis for expressive arts such

9

as dance, theatre, pantomime and ritual display. The dissociability of mimesis from language also justiﬁes the assumption that it evolved as an independent mode before language came into existence.
Despite the current dominance of speech-based communication, we should not underestimate the continuing power of mimesis. Donald builds a strong argument for the necessity of a culture intermediate between apes and Homo sapiens, and for the value of a prelinguistic, mimetic mode of communication as a force for social cohesion. Homo erectus was relatively stable as a species for well over a million years, and spread out over the entire Eurasian land mass, its tools, traces of butchery and use of ﬁre affording evidence of a complexity of social organization well beyond the reach of apes. Of particular importance for the evolution of language would have been the change in habits of thought and communication that a mimetic culture must have brought in its train. Mimesis, Donald argues, established the fundamentals of intentional expression in hominids, and laid the basis on which natural selection could act to engender the cognitive demand and neuroanatomical machinery essential to the emergence of words and of a combinatorial syntax as vehicles of symbolic thought and communication.
Can we specify more precisely the symbolic function fulﬁlled by words and syntax? As we have seen, many linguists insist that the primary function of language is conceptual representation, not communication. If we were to accept this argument, we would have no a priori grounds for attributing language to the evolutionary emergence of novel strategies of social cooperation. Most chapters in this book, however, take a different view. Language – including its distinctive representational level – is intrinsically social, and can only have evolved under fundamentally social selection pressures. Perhaps the most sophisticated, ambitious and elaborate presentation of this case was made by Terrence Deacon (1997) in his extraordinary book, The Symbolic Species, a work unique in its subtle meshing of ideas from the behavioural and brain sciences. Here, Deacon argues that language emerged concurrently with the emergence of social contracts. A contract, he observes, has no location in space, no shape or color, no physical form of any kind. It exists only as an idea shared among those committed to honouring and enforcing it. It is compulsory – one is not allowed to violate it – yet wholly nonphysical. How, then, might information about such a thing be communicated?
Deacon’s insight was that nonhuman primates are under no pressure to evolve symbolic communication because they never have to confront the problem of social contracts. As long as communication concerns only current, perceptible reality, a signaller can always display or draw attention to some feature as an index or likeness of the intended referent. But once evolving humans had begun

to establish contracts, reliance on indices and resemblances no longer sufﬁced. Where in the physical world is a ‘promise’? What does such a thing look like? Where is the evidence that it exists at all? Since it exists only for those who believe in it, there is no alternative but to settle on a conventionally agreed symbol. In Deacon’s scenario, such a symbol would originally have been an aspect of the ritual involved in cementing the contract. Selection pressures associated with such novel deployment of ritual symbolism led to the progressive re-engineering and enlargement of the primate brain.
Deacon argues that the key contracts whose symbolic representation preadapted humans for linguistic competence were those through which human females, increasingly burdened by child care, managed to secure long-term commitment from males. This argument ties in closely with recent Darwinian theory premised upon potential male/female sexual conﬂict, and brings speculation about the origins of language into the domain of anthropology in its widest sense – including current debates in sexual selection and mate choice theory, palaeoanthropology, evolutionary psychology, human palaeontology, archaeology and social anthropology. If Deacon is right, then his argument would add force to a growing contemporary awareness that language evolution must have been driven by strategies not just of cooperative males, but crucially of females (cf. Dunbar 1996; Key and Aiello 1999; Knight 1991, 1998, 1999, this volume; Knight et al. 1995; Power and Aiello 1997; Power 1998, this volume). In any event, regardless of the fate of Deacon’s detailed anthropological scenario, his work in ‘putting it all together’ has raised our collective sights, lifting us decisively to a new plane.
The present book is the second published outcome of a series of international conferences on the evolution of language. Like its predecessor (Hurford et al. 1998), it addresses the need for a sharply focused attack on the evolution of language from a post-Chomskyan perspective. We have limited it to papers that deal directly with some aspect of form or function unique to language – points at which continuity with lower primate cognition and communication seems most difﬁcult to establish.
In the introduction to the previous volume, we remarked on ‘the interactive evolutionary spiral through which both individual language capacity and a communal system of symbolic communication must have more or less simultaneously emerged’ (Hurford et al. 1998: 4). Yet few of the chapters in that volume in fact discussed that interactive spiral. By contrast, roughly half the chapters in the present volume are concerned directly or indirectly with language transmission across generations. One reason for this is their concern with social function. For only its early social function, whatever that may have been, can have launched language on its evolutionary path.

Language: A Darwinian Adaptation?

General recognition of this simple fact has perhaps been hindered by Chomsky’s (1986) proscription of externalised language (E-language), the Saussurean language of the community, as a coherent object of linguistic and psychological study. Students of language evolution have instead chosen as their proper object of study Chomsky’s internalised language (I-language), a structural property of an individual mind/brain. For Darwinians, an attraction of this focus is that the individual (or the gene), not the group, is the unit of natural selection in any adaptively complex system. But we have yet to work through the implications of the fact that it is only through exposure to fragments of E-language, to the utterance-meaning pairs of daily conversation, that a child learns its I-language. It is through others’ performance – in other words, through language as embodied in social life – that speakers internalise (and, in turn, contribute to) the language in which they are immersed.
Theoretical models of such social processes are necessarily speculative, top-heavy with questionable assumptions, even when they draw on hard facts, such as the energetic costs of brain growth or fossil evidence of neuroanatomy. Mathematical modelling is often then the best method we have for objective testing of our assumptions. The following chapters illustrate several modes of mathematical modelling. Jason Noble, for example, applies game theory to test the Krebs-Dawkins predictions of the cooperative or competitive social conditions under which communication systems might arise (Krebs and Dawkins 1984). He assesses, within the limits of his own assumptions, a powerful, hitherto untested, verbal argument that has had wide impact on theories of animal communication. At the other end of the volume, Mark Pagel pursues the analogy between languages and species (Darwin 1871: ch. 3). He draws on methods from mathematical statistics, previously used to gauge past species diversity and rates of speciation, to estimate prehistorical language diversity and rates of change. He also estimates mathematically the role of both intrinsic (‘glottochronological’) and extrinsic (ecological and cultural) factors in language change.
Perhaps most remarkable among the modelling chapters are those that simulate social interaction between speakers and learners (Bart de Boer, Simon Kirby, James Hurford and others). Here, aspects of linguistic structure are shown to arise by self-organisation from the process of interaction itself without beneﬁt of standard selection pressures. These papers might be read as an unexpected, if only partial, vindication of Chomsky’s scepticism concerning the relevance of Darwinian evolution. Certainly, they promise a sharp reduction in the amount of linguistic structure that has to be attributed to natural selection. Computer simulations of birth, social engagement in linguistic action, and death, within a group of individuals, promote a novel view of language as an emergent, self-organising system, a view as unfamiliar to biologists and psychologists as to linguists.

Yet to explain the emergence of group phenomena from the premises of Darwinian individualism is certainly not a new idea. We have long recognised that biological processes involve complex hierarchies, with structure manifested on more than one level. The need to distinguish between analytic levels, and the possibility of modelling major evolutionary transitions between them, have indeed become central to modern Darwinism (Maynard Smith and Szathma´ry 1995). Genes as such are never altruistic; yet few today would dispute that it is precisely gene-level ‘selﬁshness’ which drives the emergence of altruism and cooperation at higher levels. Many of the contributors to this book argue that linguistic communication emerges and varies as an expression of distinctively human coalitionary strategies. Such models acknowledge no incompatibility between the methodological individualism of modern Darwinism and the grouplevel focus of much social, cognitive and linguistic science (Dunbar, Knight and Power 1999; Nettle 1999b).
Linking all the following chapters is the idea that language is no ordinary adaptation, but will require ‘special’ Darwinian explanation (cf. Maynard Smith and Szathma´ry 1995). This is explicit in Part I, which isolates biologically anomalous levels of social cooperation as central to the evolutionary emergence of language. It remains a theme in Part II, in which emerging phonetic competence is attributed to unique evolutionary pressures for vocal imitation, social learning and other forms of social transmission. Finally, it is central to Part III, where the emergence of syntax is acknowledged to be entangled in complex ways with novel social and cultural strategies. Language, in short, is remarkable – as will be any adequate Darwinian explanation of its evolution.

PART I
THE EVOLUTION OF COOPERATIVE COMMUNICATION

1
Introduction: The Evolution of Cooperative Communication
CHRIS KNIGHT
‘Selﬁsh gene’ Darwinism differs from earlier versions of evolutionary theory in its focus on one key question: Why cooperate? The faculty of speech which distinguishes Homo sapiens from other species is an aspect of human social competence. By inference, it evolved in the context of uniquely human strategies of social cooperation. In these chapters, therefore, Darwinism in its modern, socially aware form provides our theoretical point of departure.
Where, previously, attention has focused on speech as the biological competence of individuals, here our themes are social. To study communication is inevitably to study social structure, social conﬂict, social strategies, social intelligence. Communication, as Robbins Burling observes in the next chapter, ‘does not begin when someone makes a sign, but when someone interprets another’s behaviour as a sign’. Reminding us of this elementary principle, Burling spells out the logical corollary: where the evolution of language is concerned, it is comprehension, not production, which sets the pace. Even a purely instrumental action, after all, may be read by others as a signal. Where this has evolutionary signiﬁcance, instrumental behaviour may then undergo modiﬁcation in the service of novel, socially conferred, signalling functions. Chomsky’s focus upon the innate creativity of the speaker has been enormously productive. But over evolutionary time, Burling points out, ‘the only innovations in production that can be successful, and thus consolidated by natural selection, are those that conform to the already available receptive competence of conspeciﬁcs’. If Burling is correct, then that syntactical structure which so radically distinguishes speech from nonhuman primate signalling must have become progressively elicited and then consolidated by generations of comprehending listeners. First, conceptual complexity is ‘read into’ signalling by the attentive mind reader; subsequently, the signaller – given such encouragement – may succeed in externalising aspects of that complexity in the signal itself.

Consistent with this scenario, one possible speculation is that speech emerged in the human lineage thanks to novel levels of care, solicitude and understanding shown by mothers toward immature offspring. Drawing on Tomasello’s work, Burling cites the infant chimpanzee ‘nursing poke’ – a conventionalised begging gesture suggestive of a human speech act. To this might be added the ‘head nod’, ‘head shake’, ‘wrist ﬂap’ and ‘tap/poke’ – cognitively expressive gestures, each with its own meaning, used by immature apes in playful interaction with each other or with mothers (Blount 1990: 429). Poignantly, however, such incipiently symbolic signs do not survive into adulthood. As potential ‘memes’, therefore, they lack any prospect of being passed on. Each mother-infant dyad or immature peer group is condemned within each generation to ‘reinvent the wheel’.
Associated with this is a social fact: whereas the human infant may anticipate long-term kin-based solicitude, beneﬁting from social provisioning well beyond infancy, the young chimp, from around age ﬁve, must fend for itself. Deprived of the prospect of caring support, it abandons the now irrelevant nursing poke along with any other subtle indications of need. Given the competitive exigencies of impending adulthood, the best preparatory training for the ape youngster may in fact be to avoid excessive reliance on cooperative understanding from others. From this perspective, elaboration of symbolic potential as young apes mature appears constrained less by cognitive deﬁcits than by a decisive social one – the obvious absence, in the wild, of any unconditionally supportive or caring audience. Why bother to elucidate one’s aims or interests to others who may at best show indifference – or at worst exploit such intelligence for their own ends?
Jason Noble takes up the theme of cooperation versus competition to ask whether a ‘pure’ state of competition is consistent with any kind of signal evolution at all. He sets out to test a theory ﬁrst proposed by John Krebs and Richard Dawkins (1978), according to whom conﬂict in the animal world leads to costly, manipulative signalling. Noble’s simulations suggest that contrary to these authors’ expectations, intensiﬁcation of competition does not culminate in maximally manipulative, inefﬁcient signals. Rather, the outcome is simply a breakdown in all communication. If empirically conﬁrmed, this would endorse the more traditional standpoint of theoretical linguistics, linking communication with shared interests. However, we need not assume generalised social harmony. According to Zahavi and Zahavi (1997), even violent antagonists may communicate on the basis of interests which they share. Predator and prey, for example, may share an interest in avoiding a chase if the potential victim is able to demonstrate that pursuing it would be a waste of time. Likewise, human military combatants may seek to retain at least certain honest channels of communication to avoid costly misunderstandings.

Evolution of Cooperative Communication

21

From all this, it would appear that there is no ultimate incompatibility between Noble’s ﬁndings, Zahavi’s and the tenets of Krebs and Dawkins. In the real world, both competition and cooperation may prevail simultaneously, albeit on different levels. Babblers collectively ‘mobbing’ a predator, for example, are on one level cooperating. Yet on another, they are competing in advertising to one another their ability to afford taking such risks (Zahavi and Zahavi 1997).
Dessalles (1998) roots speech evolution in a comparable dynamic, in which status-seeking individuals compete to emit signals perceived as relevant by their peers. Dissolving simplistic dichotomies, such behaviour might be termed ‘competition to cooperate’. Consistent with Krebs and Dawkins, however, is the ﬁnding – conﬁrmed from all sides – that fast, cheap, efﬁcient communication presupposes at least some level on which interests converge. Signals become costly and inefﬁcient – culminating eventually in physical violence – in proportion as mutual conﬂict on that level intensiﬁes.
In his contribution to this volume, Dessalles sets out to delineate more precisely the cooperative social matrix in which speech must therefore have evolved. With Dunbar (1996), Deacon (1997) and many others, he posits an evolutionary background in which increasingly large, stable coalitions engage in group-on-group competition and local conﬂict. The decisive selection pressure is status-linked social inducement to provide information relevant to the concerns of one’s own group. Dessalles accepts that such coalitionary activity amounts to cooperation, driven by strategies of reciprocal altruism which are a precondition for the evolution of speech. In his view, however, speaking as such is not reciprocal altruism.
A speaker, according to Dessalles, does not donate valuable information on a tit-for-tat basis, checking to ensure repayment in kind. Rather, it is listeners – not speakers – who are left to pay the costs of checking up on cheats. This is because, whether honestly or dishonestly, speakers are always striving to persuade their audience to reward them with status. Those coalitions which can award such status, according to Dessalles, are ‘groups of individuals showing solidarity in action, i.e. being able to take collective decisions’. In competing against the out-group, each coalition seeks to allocate internal status exclusively in return for relevance. Rather than displaying altruism, therefore, conversationalists – like contestants in any competitive board game – strive to win through linguistic ‘moves’ capable of earning status while diminishing the relative signiﬁcance of rival contributions.
Why is it that within human coalitions, status is earned this way – whereas in ape society it may be earned more effectively by manipulation or concealment of relevant information? In suggesting an answer, Dessalles points to the intrinsic dynamic of group-on-group conﬂict, whose effect may be to progressively

exclude physical aggression and/or manipulative signalling from the sphere of in-group communication. ‘In primate societies, the company of strong individuals is much sought after. From the perspective we propose, relevant information may have replaced physical strength as a determining factor in the decision to join a coalition and remain in it’. As threats and correspondingly exploitative signals become reserved for outsiders, internal status – emancipated from determination by such factors – becomes allocated on quite different grounds. Internally, signallers may now avail themselves of a novel opportunity – to compete in producing messages valued by other members of their group. As Dessalles concludes: ‘Social status among humans is not extorted by brute force. It emerges from others’ willingness to establish social bonds with you. The decision to become closer to somebody is taken according to deﬁnite criteria. Linguistic relevance may be an essential component of this choice’.
Adopting the same perspective with respect to coalitionary dynamics, status and relevance, Camilla Power reminds us of the evolutionary centrality of sexual and reproductive strategies. In Power’s model as in those of Dunbar (1996) and Knight (1991), the stable coalitions responsible for speech arise out of longterm strategies of reciprocal altruism between females. A key area of potential conﬂict between females is the issue of differential male sexual attention and associated provisioning. In particular, according to Power, pregnant and nursing mothers may experience younger and/or imminently fertilisable local females as a sexual threat. In Power’s model, they respond by coercively controlling and bonding with pubescent females from the moment of menstrual onset. Signals of imminent fertility, which might potentially incite males to differentially target menstruants, are now deliberately scrambled.
On this basis, Power explains the ethnographic pattern in which ﬁrst menstrual onset in pubescent girls triggers coercive initiation into a ritual group. Although the subjects of such treatment surrender freedom of movement and incur numerous immediate costs, in the longer term these should be outweighed by beneﬁts. Each menstruant will one day be a nursing mother herself, whereupon she will reap the beneﬁts of a coalitionary strategy aimed at preventing younger or more attractive female rivals from gaining disproportionate provisioning and attention. Moreover, the costly and often painful process of initiation has intrinsic value, acting as a demonstration of personal commitment. Here is Power’s answer to Dessalles’s question about how listeners can check up on ‘cheats’ – speakers who falsely gain status by faking the relevance of their utterances. In Power’s model, nobody even listens to speakers who have not already paid the costs of initiation into the secret society or coalition. Gossip depends on the relationships of trust that are established as commitment to the sisterhood is signalled via hard-to-fake, costly display. Relevance-based in-group status allocation operates only within such a framework.

Evolution of Cooperative Communication

23

Power demonstrates the precision with which this model’s expectations match details of the ethnography of women’s ‘secret’ language use in the context of African initiation rites. In her case studies, however, in-group solidarity is neither uniform nor unconditional. Instead, ritually bounded coalitions do show internal status differentials. Depending on their status, speakers can control or determine the relevance and availability of vital social information – such as who has been having sex with whom, or who has fathered a given child. ‘Gossip’ is the exchange of social information; inevitably, it is manipulated to serve sectional interests. The relevance or irrelevance of an utterance, according to Power, depends less on any objective informational content than on prior ritually established relationships linking the speaker with her audience.
Power observes that during an actual ritual performance, or when deployed to signal ritual status, an utterance may be accepted as relevant despite lack of propositional meaning or content. Theoretically, even a nonsense rhyme learned during initiation might appear relevant. This recalls Maurice Bloch’s (1975) ethnographic study, in which Merina political elders display ritual status through verbose speeches almost devoid of creativity, syntactical combinatoriality or any novel content. At ﬁrst sight, all this might seem in conﬂict with Dessalles’s expectation that status should depend on linguistic relevance. Ethnography indeed suggests the reverse possibility: where the purpose of signalling is to display evidence of ritually conferred status, the most relevant strategy may be to produce propositionally meaningless, repetitive verbiage.
If this is accepted, then to retain consistency with Dessalles, we must distinguish between two contrasting settings in which ‘authorised language’ (Bourdieu 1991) is used. Where internal status differentials are in the process of being established by ritual as opposed to verbal means, we expect displays or negotiations of such status to violate Dessalles’s ‘relevance’ maxims. In such contexts – as Power shows – signalling may be relevant without informational content and without making any contribution to collective decision making or problem solving.
‘Relevance’ in Dessalles’s terms, however, cannot be a property of nonsense rhymes or ritualistic, repetitive verbiage. Neither can it be a feature of simple ritual marks such as bodily scars, cosmetic designs or tattoos. Where group members demand information relevant to cooperative decision making, the necessary vehicle is syntactical speech. Here, the social matrix is one in which preordained status can be ignored, for the simple reason that in principle, everyone shares the same such status. In this democratic setting, the ground is cleared for a quite different contest, in which communicators make no prior assumptions about status differentials dividing them. Conversationalists set out with a level playing ﬁeld, in which the contest is to provide information of value to the group. Power has outlined a persuasive, ethnographically testable

model to explain how such status-conferring groups in the human case came to be established.
Knight turns from an examination of costly ritual signals to an examination of low-cost symbolic communication. Young primates frequently engage in play behaviour, whose make-believe creativity often seems suggestive of human cultural symbolism. In contrast to primate vocal signalling, the playful gestures of young apes may be rich in cognitive expressivity and complexity. Whereas ape vocal calls are analog indices of physical and/or emotional condition, the distinction between a play bite and its functional prototype is cognitive and categorical. Whereas ape vocal calls, when delivered in sequence, can yield only a blended compromise between meanings, a gesture indicating ‘This is play!’ may systematically reverse the signiﬁcance of subsequent ‘chases’ or ‘bites’. If we are seeking a primate precursor for speech creativity and combinatoriality, Knight suggests that the most convincing candidate is primate play.
But if conversational speech including humour in the human case extends and develops the creative, combinatorial potential of immature primate play, then we must ask how the conditions for such creativity came to be extended into adulthood during the course of human evolution. For Knight, the key factor acting to deny animals freedom to play is reproductive competition and conﬂict. The onset of sexual maturity brings with it the Darwinian imperative to engage in potentially lethal sexual competition. In the primate case, this impinges upon life concurrently with sexual maturity, setting up anxieties, divisions and status differentials which permeate and effectively constitute adult sociality. If imaginative playfulness diminishes in frequency, it is because autonomous, freely creative expressivity is simply not compatible with a situation in which individuals feel anxious or externally threatened. Admittedly, adult primates – most notably bonobos – do sometimes play with one another. But as competitive stresses intensify, the dominant tendency is for play ﬁghts to give way to real ones. On a more general level, by the same token, involvement in shared makebelieve yields to a more narrow preoccupation with the serious competitive imperatives of adult life.
Among humans, however, the transition to adulthood takes a different form. Human offspring go through an extended period of childhood followed by adolescence (Bogin 1997). During this extended period, the young are enabled to rely to a considerable extent on social as opposed to ‘fend-for-yourself’ provisioning. Hunter-gatherer ethnography demonstrates in addition that at a certain point, young adolescents become coercively incorporated into ritual coalitions. Rites of initiation – central to intergenerational transmission of human symbolic culture – may be viewed as a modality of animal play. In fact, they are spectacular ‘pretend-play’ performances, drawing on hallucinatory techniques

such as trance, dance, rhythm, face painting and so forth. Whether or not genital mutilation is involved, the declared aim is to curb individualistic pursuit of sexual advantage. Bonds of coalitionary solidarity, typically modelled on sibling solidarity, are accorded primacy over sexual bonds.
How did such coalitions and associated rituals become established? Power’s model of reciprocal altruism within female coalitions suggests a route through which the playfulness of infancy and childhood might have been preserved into adult life. If young fertile females are simply prohibited from presenting themselves as objects of male competitive attention, being instead retained under control by siblings and other protective kin, then such kin-based coalitionary solidarity might reduce sexual conﬂict and so establish extended opportunities for adults to engage in ‘play’. Knight argues that with the emergence of Homo sapiens, the childhood signiﬁcance of kinship indeed became preserved within adult sociality, overriding sexual bonds and thereby opening up a new social space within which language – an extension of the creativity of primate play – could now for the ﬁrst time ﬂower.
What is clear from all these contributions is the extent to which they dovetail and support one another. Burling sets the scene by reminding us that speakers could not effectively innovate in the absence of prior understanding on the part of listeners. The ensuing chapters in their different ways explore the evolutionary roots of such creative and rewarding acts of cooperative understanding. All are agreed that speech evolved to enable thoughts to be shared, its emergence inseparable from distinctively human strategies of social cooperation.

Comprehension, Production and Conventionalisation in the Origins of Language
ROBBINS BURLING
The Priority of Comprehension
This chapter explores the implications of two observations that should be reasonably obvious, or at least familiar, but when they are considered together, they lead to an unfamiliar but interesting way of thinking about the early stages of language. The ﬁrst of the two observations is simply that all of us, humans and animals alike, are always able to understand more than we can say. Comprehension runs consistently ahead of production. The second observation extends the ﬁrst: both humans and animals are sometimes able to interpret another’s instrumental behavior even when that other individual had no intention at all to communicate. In the ﬁrst part of this chapter I seek to justify these two observations. I will then consider their implications for our understanding of the origins of language.
Children, who appear to learn their ﬁrst language with such magical ease, give us the most familiar example of the priority of comprehension. Parents are always convinced that their children understand far more than they can say. Linguists have occasionally been sceptical of the superior comprehension of children, partly because a vaguely behaviourist bias makes the ‘behaviour’ of speaking seem more important than mere ‘passive’ comprehension, but also for the much better reason that it really is very difﬁcult to study comprehension. How do we know whether or not a child understands, and how do we know how he understands? Hold out a cookie to a child and ask “Do you want a cookie?” When he responds enthusiastically, how do we know whether he understands the words, or simply interprets the situation correctly? It is difﬁcult to prove to the satisfaction of a linguist, let alone some kinds of hard-nosed experimental psychologists, that children always understand more than they can say, but parents are rarely in doubt. At the time when one of my grandsons had a total productive vocabulary of exactly three words, one of which was a loud repeated

grunt meaning ‘Give it to me’, he could point appropriately not only in response to a request to show his eye, nose or mouth, but also to show his elbow, knee or shoulder. He could point not only to a window or door, but to the wall, ceiling or ﬂoor. He appeared to have a receptive vocabulary of hundreds of words at a time when he articulated only three. Comprehension is so consistently ahead of production that we ought to recognize that much that is essential about language learning happens silently as children learn to understand. Speaking should be seen as merely the ﬁnal step in a long process, the point at which language that is already under ﬁrm passive control is ﬁnally made active.
Even as adults, we understand more than we can say. We all understand dialects that we cannot produce. English speakers from opposite sides of the Atlantic and from the southern extremities of the globe can generally understand each other with no more than an occasional hitch, but few of them would ever try to speak another’s dialect. We all understand words that we would not use. We understand some of the slang of ethnic groups or generations other than our own, even if we would not risk using it ourselves. We understand some technical terminology from ﬁelds with which we are only partially familiar. We understand, and even admire, rhetorical styles that we cannot, ourselves, duplicate. In New Guinea people have a nice way of distinguishing receptive and productive skill. They may say ‘I can hear that language but I cannot speak it’, recognising that it is possible to have a skilled ability to understand a language without the ability to speak.
If we had been clearer about the ability of human beings, both young and old, to understand more than they produce, we might not have waited so long to ask how much spoken human language nonhuman primates can learn to understand. Even if an ape is incapable of uttering a single spoken word, an ability to comprehend would demonstrate some genuine knowledge of a language. Anecdotal reports have suggested that captive chimps have sometimes learned to understand a good deal of spoken language even though they said nothing at all. These reports have sometimes been met with some scepticism for the same reasons that parental claims for their children’s ability to comprehend have been doubted, partly because production seems more real than passive comprehension, but also because it so difﬁcult to measure skill in comprehension. Like people, apes can infer a great deal from the context in which language is used. It is always difﬁcult to know how much any listener, even an ape, depends upon context, and how much upon the language. Hayes and Nissen suggest that Viki learned to understand a considerable amount of spoken English, but they were so eager to teach her to articulate words that they did not systematically study her comprehension (1971). As a result, Viki is remembered for her failure to speak, rather than for her success at understanding.

With the help of Savage-Rumbaugh and her colleagues, Kanzi, the famous bonobo, has now dramatically conﬁrmed the ability of apes to learn to comprehend a signiﬁcant amount of spoken language (Savage-Rumbaugh et al. 1993). At the age of eight, Kanzi was compared to a two-year-old human girl, and their ability to understand English was remarkably similar. Kanzi, like the girl, was able to respond correctly to a large number of different words and to a considerable variety of spoken sentences. Kanzi’s receptive skills give far better evidence of linguistic ability than has ever been shown by any nonhuman primate who has been trained to produce language or language-like signals, whether by articulating spoken words, signing, manipulating plastic chips or pressing buttons. Indeed, Kanzi’s ability to comprehend a human language seems sufﬁciently extensive that he should be credited with a degree of linguistic competence that linguists have most often presumed to be exclusively human. No one need fear that a bonobo or any other ape is about to give serious competition to human children in their speed or thoroughness of language learning, but I do not doubt that Kanzi has learned a good deal of English. The pattern is consistent. Not only humans of all ages, but apes as well, are always able to understand more than they can say.

Ritualisation
Comprehension plays a crucial role in the origin of animal signals, for signals become communicative not when they are ﬁrst produced, but only when they are ﬁrst understood. The gestures and vocalisations by which animals communicate with one another develop from acts that were originally purely instrumental (Tinbergen 1952). Instrumental acts are the movements or noises that form a part of the ordinary business of living – moving around, eating, scratching, yawning. Although instrumental behavior is produced with no communicative intent whatsoever, conspeciﬁcs may still be able to interpret it. Only after such behavior has come to convey some sort of meaning to another animal can it develop into a speciﬁcally communicative signal. A classic example is a dog’s snarl.
Snarls began as simple instrumental gestures, nothing more than a part of getting ready to bite. The lip had to be moved out of the way of the teeth, but at ﬁrst, the gesture had no communicative intent and probably no communicative result. Eventually, however, potential victims came to recognize the retracted lip as a signal that a bite was imminent. Those clever enough to read the signs would then be encouraged to ﬂee, and so they could avoid the bite and live to reproduce. Comprehension, in other words, came before any communication was intended by the snarler. Comprehension was the ﬁrst step but once the victims were

30

Robbins Burling

able to understand, the aggressor was presented with a new opportunity. By retracting his lip as if to bite, he might manage to frighten off his enemy but avoid the much riskier activity of really biting. It might even help to move the lip in a stereotyped or exaggerated manner and so reduce the sign’s ambiguity. As production and comprehension of the signal evolved together, the sign can be said to have become ‘ritualised’, modiﬁed from a purely instrumental act into a stereotypic communicative signal.
The instrumental lip movement evolved into a communicative snarl, transmitting information that was useful both to the aggressor and to his potential victim. All this happened, of course, under the slow but relentless pressures of natural selection, and it required no individual learning. The term ‘phylogenetic ritualisation’ is sometimes used for this process so as to emphasise that signals like the snarl develop by slow evolution, not by rapid learning, but the point that I want to stress here is that the process has to start with comprehension. The ritualisation of the lip movement could not even begin until it was understood. Other animal signs probably began much as did the snarl. Some sort of instrumental gesture or noise that was already being made for purposes other than communication was understood by other animals. Only then could it be ritualised into a speciﬁcally communicative signal.
By recognising that comprehension has priority over production, both in our own language and in the origin of animal signals, we can start to solve a puzzle that has hovered over the ﬁrst appearance of language: what could the ﬁrst speaker have hoped to accomplish with her ﬁrst words if no one else was around with the skills to understand her? The puzzle disappears as soon as we recognize that communication does not begin when someone makes a sign, but when someone interprets another’s behaviour as a sign. Comprehension must have been ahead from the very beginning. The original behaviour that was understood in a language-like way could not have been intended as a sign at all. A lonely producer who tries out a new kind of sign will almost certainly fail to communicate. A lonely comprehender, on the other hand, may gain considerable advantage by being able to interpret another’s actions even when no communication at all had been intended. At every stage of evolution, the selective pressures favouring skill at comprehension are likely to have been considerably more insistent than the selective pressures favouring skill at production. Producers often beneﬁt by not giving themselves away. Comprehenders have little to lose and much to gain by understanding more.
The precocity of comprehension implies that at every point along the evolutionary path toward language, understanders needed to be ready before another complexity could be added to production. More accurately: The only innovations in production that can be successful, and so consolidated by natural

selection, are those that conform to the already available receptive competence of conspeciﬁcs. At every point, production would have been limited by and directed by the ability to comprehend that was already found in the population. Only when others were able to understand would a speaker be able to use new linguistic tricks. This disposes of any mystery about the communicative usefulness of the ﬁrst wordlike signs. They would not even have been produced with communicative intent. Their communicative value came from the skill of the receiver, not from the intent of the producer.
The question that we should ask, therefore, is not ‘Why did the ﬁrst speaker try to communicate if no one was around who shared his talents?’ The answer to this is very simple: ‘He didn’t. It would have been useless’. A much better question is ‘Why would anyone make wordlike signs in the absence of any intention to communicate?’ A plausible answer to this question is that the ﬁrst interpretable language-like signs were instrumental acts. Once these instrumental acts could be interpreted by conspeciﬁcs, it became possible to conventionalise them as deliberate communicative signals. This implies that wordlike signs could have had an origin that is quite similar to that of animal signals like the snarl, but there is one crucial difference. Almost all animal signals have been ritualised by the long process of natural selection. Early wordlike signs, on the other hand, could have been conventionalised within the lifetime of a single individual.
The process that I am calling ‘conventionalisation’ is sometimes referred to as ‘ontogenetic ritualisation’ (Tomasello and Call 1997: 299–302). By using the word ‘ritualisation’, this phrase acknowledges the parallels between the origin of animal signals such as the dog’s snarl (phylogenetic ritualisation) and the origin of signals that depend upon individual learning (ontogenetic ritualisation). I prefer to keep the jargon under at least partial control by calling the latter process ‘conventionalisation’ (or, when I want to be very explicit ‘ontogentic conventionalisation’) but, whatever it is called, it must be distinguished from the ritualisation that is phylogenetic. If we are to ﬁnd examples of conventionalisation today, we should look for instrumental acts that can be interpreted by conspeciﬁcs, but that then become conventionalised as communicative signals. Such instrumental acts can be found among both humans and apes. Indeed, conventionalisation can take place so easily that we hardly realise that it is happening.

Conventionalisation
Consider, for example, the simple and familiar ‘arms-up’ gesture by which toddlers ask to be picked up. This begins instrumentally. It is simply one part of a baby’s adaptation to the impinging world, in this case a part of his interaction

32

Robbins Burling

with bigger people. After being lifted often enough by adult hands that have been placed under his arms, a baby learns to spread and then raise his arms in anticipation. Adults, in turn, learn to recognize the gesture, and it quickly becomes conventionalised into a stylised request. The arms-up gesture is so common that we might almost suppose it to be an innate and species-wide signal, but it is more dependent upon learning than, for example, our facial expressions of anger or joy. Unlike the words of a language and unlike our ‘quotable gestures’ such as the bye-bye wave, the arms-up gesture is ordinarily learned not by imitation or direct instruction, but rather through mutual adjustment to the actions of other people. It is conventionalised from an instrumental gesture, but it comes to act as a deliberate communicative signal.
The begging gesture – hand extended, palm upward with the ﬁngers together – is learned in much the same way. Humans share this gesture with chimpanzees so it has deep roots, but it requires more learning by each infant than do the calls and gestures that form the inherited communicative repertory of each species.
A parallel example, this one audible rather than visible, is provided by the humble grunt. Lorraine McCune and her colleagues have studied grunting in human and nonhuman primate infants, and have followed the development of human grunting from a purely instrumental noise to a communicative signal (McCune et al. 1996; McCune 1999). They were able to distinguish three stages of grunting in the children they observed. First came effort grunts that occurred when babies exerted themselves, as when reaching for an object, when changing position or when crawling. Effort grunts occurred in the ﬁrst month of life and, of course, we all still make them. Those observed by McCune were purely instrumental, a by-product of a baby’s exertion. Attention grunts appeared a bit later and occurred when children were paying attention to something by looking at it or by touching it, but they were made without any indication of special effort or any sign of an intention to communicate. These attention grunts could still have been noticed and responded to by caretakers, however, and the children could have discovered that they could attract attention with a grunt. Finally, the children made communicative grunts. These occurred while the child looked at its mother, reached toward her or tugged at her when trying to attract, or be certain of, her attention. Communicative grunts appeared during the second year, close to the time when words began to be used. Like words, the communicative grunts were deliberate communicative signals.
Examples of conventionalised instrumental acts that I ﬁnd even more interesting than those of human children come from the observations of Michael Tomasello and his co-workers who have studied the communication of young

Origins of Language

33

chimpanzees who were growing up in a semi-naturalistic situation at the Yerkes Primate Center Field Station in Georgia, USA (1985, 1989, 1994). These young chimpanzees use a wide variety of gestures to communicate with each other and with adults. For example, infants develop idiosyncratic ways to let their mothers know that they want to nurse. These gestures begin when a baby simply pushes his mother’s arm aside so that it can reach the nipple. Mothers learn to recognize this instrumental act and this, in turn, permits the gesture to be conventionalised until the infant needs only to touch its mother in a characteristic way, and she will understand that it wants to nurse. The interesting point is that the gestures are quite idiosyncratic. Each infant uses them only with its own mother, never with another individual, so each pair is free to develop its own convention.
Young chimps also learn to use a considerable number of other idiosyncratic gestures. Some slap the ground, stamp their feet or throw things as an invitation to play. They direct an adult’s hand or point to their side when they want to be tickled. They present their back when they would like to be groomed. They beg with an extended hand. Many of these gestures vary from one individual to another, and many are never made to a young chimp by an older animal, making it impossible to learn them by imitation. Nevertheless, these communicative gestures of young chimps are under far less tight genetic control than a dog’s snarl. They have to be learned by each individual, conventionalised in the course of ontogeny.

Signal Types
Table 2.1 places conventionalised instrumental acts in the context of other forms of animal and human communication. Examples of human and animal signals are listed on the left, and their most relevant properties are shown at the right. The two sets of rows at the top are all examples of signals that I like to call ‘gesture-calls’. This term is simply a way to recognise the unity of the auditory and visible aspects of mammalian signaling and, at the same time, to acknowledge the similarity of one component of human communication to the communication of other mammals. We do not usually think of human beings as having ‘calls’ but our laughter, screams and sobs join with our bodily postures and facial expressions to form a thoroughly primate system of communication. This is the gesture-call system of the human primate, unique to our species in its details, just as the details of each gesture-call system are unique to its species, but consisting of signals very much like those of other primates, both in the way they are produced and in the kinds of messages they convey (Burling 1993). Our gesture-calls have been built into each of us by the long process of phylogenetic ritualisation. Like the gesture-calls of other primates, they need, at most, to be

triggered by the experiences that come to each individual in the normal course of maturation. They are narrowly determined by our genetic inheritance.
Toward the bottom of the table are the most language-like parts of human communication. These include language itself, both the spoken languages of hearing people and the signed languages of the deaf, and also the gestures that Kendon has aptly called ‘quotable’ (1993). These include hand signals such as the V-for-victory sign, the thumbs-up gesture, the head screw to suggest that someone is crazy, and a great many more. Like the words of a language,

these quotable gestures have to be learned. They differ much more from one community to another than do our gesture-calls, and they form a part of the community’s cultural tradition. In addition to these wordlike gestures, we also use a number wordlike noises, such as oh-oh and tsk-tsk. These noises are not quite words because they neither conform to the phonological system of a language (which is why they are difﬁcult to spell) nor ﬁt into its syntax. Like true words and like quotable gestures, however, these not-quite-words have to be learned, are passed down by tradition and vary from one community to another. By analogy with ‘quotable gestures’ they might be called ‘quotable noises’.
Between the gesture-calls and the language-like signs in the table are the conventionalised gestures and noises that have already been discussed. They share some properties with gesture-calls and other properties with language.
These three types of communicative signals differ most sharply in the way they are acquired. Both gesture-calls and conventionalised gestures or noises begin as instrumental acts, but snarls and other gesture-calls have become communicative by being ritualised through the long process of natural selection. The arms-up gesture, communicative grunts and nursing pokes have to be learned, or in a sense invented, by each individual while interacting with others. Like language and like quotable gestures and noises, the conventionalised signals have to be learned by each individual, but only the language-like signals are learned by imitation. Only they can be perpetuated as a part of the cultural tradition of a community.
In addition to being learned, conventionalised gestures share one other important characteristic with language: instead of grading into one another they are in contrast. There are no half-way signals between two conventionalised gestures any more than there are half-way signals between two contrasting words. A different way of making this point is to say that the conventionalised gestures belong to a digital system, while our gesture-calls form an analog system. Giggles, laughs and guffaws are connected by a continuum of signals that are intermediate both in the way they are formed and in the meaning they convey. Many of our facial expressions, such as those that show our anger, joy and fear, also grade into each other. So, apparently, do many or most of the gesture-calls of the great apes (Marler 1976). The conventionalised gesture by which a chimpanzee infant shows that it wants to nurse, on the other hand, does not grade into anything else. Unlike a laugh, it does not occur in a range of slightly varied forms with related but slightly varied meanings. An arms-up gesture is unambiguously a request to be picked up. No intermediate gestures connect it to the equally unambiguous begging gesture. These signals are as discrete as human quotable gestures, and this makes them considerably more language-like than are gesture-calls. It is true, of course, that some animal signals are discrete.

36

Robbins Burling

The famous vervet alarm calls, for example, appear to be safely distinct from one another, but if ape and human gesture-calls are predominantly graded, the discreteness of vervet alarms is hardly relevant to the phylogeny of language.

Words and Conventionalised Gestures
Ontogenetically conventionalised acts are more wordlike than are gesture-calls but they are by no means words, and once we have isolated them as a special type of signal we can see both the ways in which they resemble words and the ways in which they differ.
One difference is the greater degree of iconicity of the conventionalised gestures and noises. It is true that the sign languages of the deaf have considerably greater iconicity than does spoken language, but as linguists like to insist, most spoken words have no resemblance at all to the things they stand for. Linguists illustrate this by such obvious examples as the words for head. The French say teˆte and the Germans say Kopf, and any other form would do equally well so long as it is accepted by the community. Many, though not all, of the gesturecalls of both humans and animals might also be regarded as arbitrary. A dog’s wagging tail tells us that he is happy, while the wagging tail of a cat conveys a very different emotion. The relationship between the form and the meaning of a tail wag may seem to be every bit as arbitrary as the relation between the form and meaning of a spoken word. However, unlike words, but like other animal signals, tail wags are ﬁrmly set by the genetic inheritance of the species. This gives the ritualised arbitrariness of gesture-calls an utterly different basis than the conventional arbitrariness of words.
Conventionalised instrumental gestures are far from arbitrary, for they reﬂect the instrumental origin of the gestures or noises from which they were derived. In spite of their conventionalisation, for example, the arms-up and begging gestures retain a good deal of the iconicity of their instrumental origins. Comparing the iconicity and arbitrariness of various types of signs is difﬁcult because most varieties of signs, even words, show a mixture of arbitrariness and iconicity so the differences are far from sharp. Nevertheless, the relatively high degree of iconicity of conventionalised signs seems clear.
Another difference between the conventionalised signs and language is that none of the conventional signs are used symmetrically between two individuals. A parent and child can use the same words with one another, but parents do not use the arms-up gesture to their children as a request to be picked up. If a parent uses the arms-up gesture it is in playful imitation of the child, not a serious request. Chimpanzee infants make nursing gestures to their mothers, but mothers do not make the same gesture to their offspring. Moreover, unlike most

Origins of Language

37

words, none of the conventionalised gestures are names for things. They are, instead, imperatives – requests or commands for an action by another individual. Even the attention grunt is a request for attention.
Finally, it must be emphasised once more that the conventionalised signs are not learned by imitation. Without imitation, it is impossible for an entire community to share the same sign, or for signs to be passed down from one generation to the next. There is no indication that chimpanzee nursing gestures, infant grunts or the arms-up gesture are learned by imitation. In the absence of imitation, individuals or pairs of communicating individuals are free to differ in the forms of their signals. Ontogenetically conventionalised gestures do not lead a species across the boundaries of culture.
In spite of their asymmetrical use and imperative function, the absence of imitation and their relatively high degree of iconicity, conventionalised signs resemble words in important ways. Like language, but unlike gesture-calls, the conventionalised signs are learned, conventional and discrete. These characteristics make them a much more promising source for early language than is any part of a gesture-call system.

Conclusions
As soon as we recognise that comprehension had to come ﬁrst in the phylogeny of language, just as it came ﬁrst in the history of animal calls and gestures and just as it comes ﬁrst for each individual child, we are led to ask some new questions about the ﬁrst stages of human language. We should ask about the kinds of selective pressures that might have driven our prehuman and early human ancestors toward an increasingly skilled ability to interpret the instrumental acts of others. We should also ask how, at later stages, they could have begun to understand the acts of others in increasingly wordlike and then sentence-like ways. The origins of comprehension should, after all, be less mysterious than the origins of production. Producers may have excellent reasons not to give themselves away, so it is often highly advantageous not to communicate. On the other hand, any animal, including a human animal, has little to lose and potentially a great deal to gain by understanding as much as possible from the behaviour of conspeciﬁcs: What is that fellow likely to do? What does she want? Why is she moving off in that direction? What does that grunt mean? The more one animal can infer from the actions of others, the more skillfully it can plan its own behavior. As mutual comprehension improves, of course, a time will come when it will be advantageous for individuals to exploit the comprehension of others. Then they can adapt their own production to the comprehension skills of their conspeciﬁcs. They can act in deliberately informative ways. Then, and

38

Robbins Burling

only then, does the coevolutionary development of productive and receptive skills begin.
A focus on improved comprehension might give us a different picture of the sequence by which new features enter language than does a focus on production. It is not at all obvious that we would expect the same sequence if we ask how people might have built up their understanding as we would expect if we ask how they would come to produce an increasingly complex language. If, for example, we assume that our forebears used single words before joining them together into orderly sequences, we will want to ask how the joining could have begun. A focus on comprehension should lead us to ask how understanders could start to make inferences from the sequence of the words they hear, even when the producer had made no effort to arrange them in orderly ways. The ﬁrst step, quite plausibly, could have been nothing more than a gradual increase in the frequency of individual words. As more and more words were used, they would begin to bump up against each other. They would emerge in more rapid succession, but without any deliberate structure having been imposed upon them. Even without intending to do so, however, speakers might use words in consistent ways. If they thought chronologically, for example, they might utter their words in a sequence that iconically reﬂected the chronology of events. Once comprehenders began to perceive the chronological signiﬁcance of the word order that they heard from others, producers might ﬁnd it advantageous to exploit that understanding in order to communicate more precisely. A rudimentary iconic syntax would then become possible. As soon as we recognise that it becomes useful for speakers to use a new form of communication only after their interlocutors have the ability to understand it, we should ask, for every feature that must enter a language, why producers would have begun to use it without any intention of communicating. How could understanding develop even before speakers began to exploit it?
The questions that I have raised in this concluding section of the chapter are different from those that have most often been asked by those of us who are interested in the origin of language, but they arise naturally as soon as we recognise the central role of comprehension. I believe these questions deserve careful thought and debate.

1. Language Origins and Darwinian Thought
Theories of the origin of language are necessarily speculative. Calvin (1983) suggests that the development of language involved a transfer of the skills involved in stone throwing; Knight (1998) puts the roots of language in ritual; Bickerton (1998) argues that language arose from protolanguage in a single catastrophic mutation. Any one of these accounts might be true, but it is difﬁcult or impossible to gather direct evidence that would allow us to decide between them. An unkind observer might conclude that anything goes, and that one foundation myth is as good as another.
However, such cynicism would be misplaced. In recent years the range of acceptable speculation has been greatly narrowed by the recognition that any account of language origins must be consistent with the principles of evolution by natural selection. For instance, modern Darwinism tells us that complex traits do not evolve without having some function, that all of the intermediate stages in the evolution of modern linguistic capacity must themselves have had adaptive value and that gradual development is more plausible than catastrophic change. These sorts of constraints immediately rule out many stories of language origin, such as the suggestion by Gould (1987) that language is a mere by-product of having a large and complex brain.
The chief problem for a Darwinian account of human speech, however, is the apparent level of altruism involved. The orthodox position in evolutionary biology (Dawkins 1976) suggests that organisms are best understood as products of their selﬁsh genes: they do not do things for the good of the group or the species, but in order to propagate copies of their own genetic material. Given this perspective, speech (and many other forms of cooperative behaviour) can be difﬁcult to account for. Why do speakers freely exchange valuable information when the theory of natural selection predicts selﬁshness? In a hypothetical
40

protolinguistic community, what would prevent the rise of a selﬁsh mutant strain that listened but did not speak? Speaking or signalling always costs something in terms of time and energy, and may involve more indirect costs such as exposing the signaller to greater predation risk. Why not reap the beneﬁts of the informative signals of others, without paying the costs of signalling oneself? Or worse, why not use the communication system to lie, misinforming others for one’s own beneﬁt?
Possible answers to this dilemma are usually phrased in terms of kin selection (Hamilton 1964) or reciprocal altruism (Trivers 1971): speakers or signallers remain honest because they are helping their relatives or because they want others to do the same for them, respectively. There are alternative explanations. Dessalles (1998, this volume) presents the intriguing suggestion that honest information is given freely because it is a way of competing for status within the group. Knight (1998) argues that the cooperative exchange of information that characterises speech involves a great risk of deception, and therefore that speechlike communication could only be evolutionarily stable if there was some mechanism that made it strategically sound to trust other members of the group. Knight believes that this mechanism is ritual; group members demonstrate their allegiance to the common cause by performing a costly ritual act, and this allows the rest of the group to believe their potentially fakeable signals in future.
Knight’s argument relies in part on a view of communication presented in the behavioural ecology literature by Krebs and Dawkins (1984). Krebs and Dawkins do not deﬁne animal communication in terms of information transmission but as a method whereby one animal exploits the muscle power of another. They outline two possibilities for the coevolution of signalling and response behaviour (see Section 3): one that leads to costly, manipulative signals and another that leads to quiet, efﬁcient and honest communication. The latter – cooperative signalling – occurs when it is in the interest of both animals that the signaller successfully ‘manipulate’ the receiver. Knight argues that human speech is the sort of system that one would expect to have resulted from the second process, and this motivates his hypothesis that ritual was the key to creating the necessary cooperative context.

2. Simulating the Evolution of Communication
Interesting as Knight’s work is, the goal of this chapter is to explore not his theory but that of Krebs and Dawkins (1984), using game theory and computer simulations of evolution. The sceptical reader may need convincing, however, that Krebs and Dawkins’s ideas are relevant to the evolution of language. It is true that their work is most easily applied to simple animal signalling systems, and it

42

Jason Noble

is certainly true that the communication systems presented here (in simulation) will be much simpler than language. Nevertheless, Krebs and Dawkins’s theory is important and relevant because it forces us to recognise the Darwinian truth that animals, including ourselves, must be expected to be manipulative rather than informative, all things being equal. This fact must be constantly borne in mind in trying to account for the anomalous levels of altruism in speech. Furthermore, modelling simple prelinguistic communication is useful because it puts further constraints on theories of how language itself evolved – as things stand there is room for far too many plausible possibilities.
Mathematical and simulation modelling are necessary steps if we are to go beyond an impasse in which the proponents of competing theories merely trade rhetoric. Formal models can produce counterintuitive results, and show, for instance, that of two apparently plausible theories only one is internally consistent. An excellent example of the value of a good model in theorising about communication is the story of the handicap principle. This idea was introduced by Zahavi (1975), who proposed that signallers sacriﬁce some of their ﬁtness (i.e. impose a handicap on themselves) in order to produce signals that will be believed by receivers. When the handicap principle was ﬁrst introduced, it was generally not accepted by theoretical biologists. Simple population-genetic models seemed to show that it could not be evolutionarily stable. However, an elaborate mathematical model developed by Grafen (1990) appears to have vindicated Zahavi’s idea, and has made the handicap principle a respectable explanatory construct.
Simulation models of the evolution of communication have been put forward before, but have rarely considered the general case that is implied by Krebs and Dawkins’s theory: the possibility that different kinds of communication may evolve under conditions of conﬂict and of cooperation. Earlier models have often been constructed such that honest signalling was always in the interests of both signallers and receivers. Thus, only cooperative communication systems could possibly emerge. For example, Werner and Dyer (1991) postulated blind, mobile males and sighted, immobile females: the evolution of a signalling system was in the interests of both parties as it allowed mating to take place at better-than-chance frequencies. In MacLennan and Burghardt’s (1994) model, signallers and receivers were rewarded if and only if they engaged in successful communicative interactions.
Other models (Ackley and Littman 1994; Oliphant 1996) have considered the special case where communication would beneﬁt receivers, but the potential signallers are indifferent. Oliphant argues that this is a good way to model the evolution of alarm calls, for example: if one bird in a ﬂock spots an approaching hawk, it is clear that its conspeciﬁcs would beneﬁt from an alarm call. However,

Evolution of Prelinguistic Communication

43

why should the bird in question, considered as a product of its selﬁsh genes, give the call?
Finally, some simulation models have considered the evolution of communication in situations where the two parties appear to have conﬂicting interests. Wheeler and de Bourcier (1995) modelled aggressive territorial signalling. Bullock (1997) constructed a general model in which signallers of varying degrees of quality solicited receivers for a favourable response; receivers were rewarded for responding positively only to high-quality signallers. A secondary goal of the current chapter is to try to position this earlier simulation work in an overarching theoretical context.

3. Expensive Hype and Conspiratorial Whispers
Krebs and Dawkins (1984) view signalling as a competitive affair involving mind reading and manipulation. Mind reading consists of one animal exploiting tell-tale predictors about the future behaviour of another, such as a dog noticing the bared teeth of an opponent, concluding that it is about to attack and ﬂeeing in order to avoid injury. Manipulation is what happens when those being mind-read ﬁght back, inﬂuencing the behaviour of the mind readers to their own advantage. For example, a dog could bare its teeth despite not having the strength or inclination to attack, and thereby scare off its mind-reading opponent. Krebs and Dawkins predict evolutionary arms races between manipulative signallers and sceptical receivers: ‘selection will act simultaneously to increase the power of manipulators and to increase resistance to it’ (1984: 390). The result will be increasingly costly, exaggerated signals; examples from nature include the roars of red deer stags and the elaborate tails of peacocks.
Krebs and Dawkins admit, however, that not all interactions are competitive in nature. There are some situations in which it is to the receiver’s advantage to be manipulated by the signaller. For example, a pack-hunting predator may attempt to recruit a conspeciﬁc in order to bring down prey too large for either to tackle alone. Foraging bees, on returning to the hive, may indicate to their closely related hivemates the direction and distance to a source of nectar. In these cases the receiver’s compliance is to the beneﬁt of both parties, i.e. there exists the possibility of cooperation. Krebs and Dawkins argue that when the two parties share a common interest in this way, then a different kind of signal coevolution will result. Speciﬁcally, there will be selection for signals that are as energetically cheap as possible while still being detectable; Krebs and Dawkins suggest the phrase ‘conspiratorial whispers’ to describe these signals. Rather than signallers needing to be more and more extravagant in their attempts to persuade receivers, the opposite process occurs: receivers are eager

44

Jason Noble

to be persuaded, and selection will favour subtle signalling and low response thresholds.
Krebs and Dawkins’s argument has been inﬂuential but no formal justiﬁcation of it exists. The models presented here will test their prediction that evolved signals will necessarily be more costly when there is a conﬂict of interests than when the two parties have common interests. In order to do so, it will ﬁrst be necessary to determine whether communication should be expected at all when signallers and receivers have a genuine conﬂict of interests.

4. Conﬂicts of Interest
The ﬁrst requirement in constructing a general model of communication is a classiﬁcation scheme for determining when a conﬂict of interests exists between signallers and receivers – Figure 3.1 shows such a scheme, adapted from Hamilton (1964). Assume that a successful instance of communication in a particular scenario has ﬁtness implications for both participants. The ﬁtness effect on signallers, PS, and the ﬁtness effect on receivers, PR, together deﬁne a point on the plane in Figure 3.1. For example, consider a hypothetical food call, by which one animal alerts another to the presence of a rich but limited food source. By calling and thus sharing the food, the signaller incurs a ﬁtness cost; by responding to the call, the receiver beneﬁts through obtaining food it might otherwise have missed. Thus, the call would be located in the ‘altruism’ quadrant. The situations modelled by Ackley and Littman (1994) and Oliphant (1996), where receivers beneﬁt but signallers are ambivalent, can be thought of as points on the positive vertical axis, i.e. where PS = 0 and PR > 0.

Figure 3.1. Possible communication scenarios classiﬁed by their effects on the ﬁtness of each participant.

Evolution of Prelinguistic Communication

45

Conﬂicts of interest can be deﬁned as interactions in which natural selection favours different outcomes for each participant (Trivers 1974) or in which participants place the possible outcomes in a different rank order (Maynard Smith and Harper 1995). Conﬂicts of interest therefore exist when PS and PR are of opposite sign, i.e. in the upper left and lower right quadrants. Selection will, by deﬁnition, favour actions that have positive ﬁtness effects. In the upper left and lower right quadrants, one animal but not the other will be selected to participate in the communication system: their interests conﬂict. The ‘spite’ quadrant does not represent a conﬂict of interests because the two parties will each be selected not to communicate.
If the speciﬁed ﬁtness effects of participating in a communicative interaction are truly net values, and already include such factors as the cost of signalling and the cost of making a response (as well as inclusive ﬁtness considerations and costs due to exploitation of the signal by predators, etc.), then predicting the evolution of the communication system is trivial. Reliable communication requires, on average, honest signallers and trusting receivers, and thus will only develop when PS > 0 and PR > 0, i.e. when both participants are selected to participate. However, real animals sometimes communicate despite apparent conﬂicts of interest (Hinde 1981). Recent models (Grafen 1990; Bullock 1997) have established that, in certain situations where communication would otherwise be unstable, increasing the production costs of the signal can lead to a prediction of evolutionarily stable signalling. Therefore, in the current model, PS and PR refer to gross ﬁtness effects before the speciﬁc costs of producing the signal, CS, and making the response, CR, have been taken into account.

5. A Simple Signalling Game
If the signalling interaction is to involve information transmission, and allow for the possibilities of deception and manipulation, it must be modelled as a game of imperfect information, in which the signaller knows something that the receiver does not. Figure 3.2 shows the extended form of a simple action-response game that fulﬁls this requirement. The game begins with a chance move (the central square) in which some state is randomly determined to be either ‘high’ or ‘low’. The signaller has access to this state, and we can suppose that it represents some feature of the environment that only the signaller has detected, e.g. noticing an approaching predator. Based on this state, the signaller (Player I) must decide whether or not to send an arbitrary signal of cost CS. The receiver (Player II) is ignorant of the hidden state and only knows whether or not a signal was sent – the dashed rectangles show the receiver’s information sets. The receiver can respond either positively by performing some action appropriate to the high

46

state, or negatively by not responding at all. Positive responses incur a cost, CR. If and only if the hidden state is high, a positive response results in the payoffs PS and PR to the signaller and receiver, respectively. Table 3.1 speciﬁes the payoff matrix. Hurd (1995), Oliphant (1996) and Bullock (1997) used similar games with different payoff structures.
The game models a range of possible communicative interactions. For example, suppose that the high state represents the signaller’s discovery of food. Sending a signal might involve emitting a characteristic sound, while not sending a signal is to remain silent. For the receiver, a positive response means approaching the signaller and sharing the food, whereas a negative response means doing nothing. Various possibilities exist besides honest signalling of the high state: the receiver might always approach the signaller in the hope of obtaining food, regardless of whether a signal was sent. The signaller might be uninformative and never signal, or only signal when food was not present. One important feature of the game is that the signaller is ambivalent about the receiver’s response in the low state – in terms of the example, this represents the assumption that when no food has been discovered, the signalling animal does not care about whether the receiver approaches or not.
The strategies favoured at any one time will depend on the relative values of PS, PR, CS and CR, as well as on what the other members of the population are doing. (Another parameter of interest in the signalling game is the relative frequency of high and low states; in the models presented here each state occurs 50% of the time.) Allowing the base ﬁtness effects PS and PR to vary across

positive and negative values will allow the payoff space of Figure 3.1 to be explored, and thus determine whether changes in signal and response cost can produce stable signalling in situations that would otherwise involve conﬂicts of interest. This will be a ﬁrst step towards assessing Krebs and Dawkins’s conspiratorial-whispers theory.

6. Stable Strategies in the Simple Game
A signalling strategy in the simple game speciﬁes whether to respond with no signal (NS) or with a signal (Sig) to low and high states, respectively. Likewise, a response strategy speciﬁes whether to respond negatively (Neg) or positively (Pos) when faced with no signal or with a signal. A strategy pair is the conjunction of a signalling and a response strategy. For instance, the strategy pair (NS/Sig, Neg/Pos) speciﬁes signalling only in the high state, and responding positively only to signals – call this the honest strategy.
It can be shown (Maynard Smith 1982) that honesty will be an evolutionarily stable strategy (ESS) if:
PS > CS > 0 PR > CR > 0.
That is, honest signalling is stable if the costs of signalling and responding are both positive and if the payoffs in each case outweigh the costs. The requirement that PS and PR must both be positive means that the honest strategy is only expected to be stable in cooperative contexts.
Of the 16 possible strategy pairs, there are three besides the honest strategy that involve the transmission of information in that the receiver responds differently to different hidden states. None of these three strategy pairs are ESSs if CS and CR are both positive; these two values represent energetic costs and so cannot sensibly be negative. If CS = 0, i.e. if giving a signal is of negligible cost, then the reverse of the honesty strategy (Sig/NS, Pos/Neg) can be stable, although PS and PR must still be positive. It is also worth noting that any mixed strategy involving (NS/NS, Pos/Pos) and (NS/NS, Pos/Neg) – both nonsignalling strategies where the receiver always responds positively – can be an ESS if the payoff to the receiver is large enough, i.e. if:
CS > 0 PS > −CS PR > 2CR > 0.
The analysis indicates that while the cost of signalling plays some role in stabilising the honest strategy, there are no circumstances in which stable

communication is predicted when a conﬂict of interests exists. This is true even though we have separated the costs of signalling and responding from the base ﬁtness payoffs of a communicative interaction.

7. An Evolutionary Simulation Model
Game theory is limited to describing equilibria; an evolutionary simulation model of the simple game was also constructed in order to determine whether communicative behaviour might sometimes be found outside the range of identiﬁed ESSs.
A straightforward genetic algorithm (GA) was used; see Mitchell (1996) for an introduction to this technique. Each individual could play both signalling and receiving roles, and a strategy pair was speciﬁed by a four-bit genotype as shown in Table 3.2. The population size was 100, the mutation rate was 0.01 per locus, and crossover was not used. For each generation, 500 games were played between randomly selected opponents. An individual could therefore expect to play 5 games as a signaller and 5 as a receiver. The individual’s ﬁtness score was the total payoff from these games. For breeding purposes, the ﬁtness scores were normalised by subtracting the minimum score from each, and proportionate selection was then applied to the normalised scores. The genetic algorithm was run in this manner for 500 generations. In the results presented below, the games played in the ﬁnal, i.e. 500th, generation have been used as a snapshot of the evolved signalling strategies.
In order to see how communication might arise from a noncommunicative context, the initial population for the genetic algorithm was not randomly generated (as is usually done), but was constructed in such a way that no communication occurred. Populations underwent 100 generations of preliminary evolution in which their receiving strategies were free to evolve but their signalling strategies were clamped at ‘00’, i.e. no signalling. A simulation run was performed for all combinations of integer values of PS and PR between −5 and +5, making 121 runs in all. Each run was repeated 25 times with different random seeds. The values of CS and CR were ﬁxed at 1.
Communication was indexed by cross-tabulating the hidden state value with the receiver’s response and calculating a chi-squared statistic. The receiver has no direct access to the hidden state, so any reliable correspondence between state and response indicates that information has been transmitted and acted upon. Values of the χ 2 statistic close to zero indicate no communication, and values close to the maximum (in this case χm2ax = 500, given the 500 games played in the ﬁnal, snapshot generation) indicate near-perfect communication.

Figure 3.3 shows the average values of the communication index over the repeated simulations; the cooperative quadrant is at the left rear of the graph. Clearly the conditions for the stability of the honest strategy, as established by the game-theoretic analysis in Section 6, are not the same as the conditions established here for the evolution of honest signalling from noncommunicative beginnings. If PS > 1 and PR = 2, communication develops but if PS > 1 and PR > 2 it does not. In the latter region PR > 2CR and the population remains at the nonsignalling ESS described earlier: although communication would result in a higher average ﬁtness, the high value of PR keeps the receivers responding positively at all times, removing any incentive for the signallers to bother signalling. Note that under no circumstances does stable communication occur when there is any conﬂict of interest between the two parties, i.e. outside the cooperative quadrant.
8. A Game with Variable Signal Costs
In the simple signalling game, signallers can choose between a costly signal or no signal at all. The model does not allow for a range of possible signals with differing costs, and in this respect it is unrealistic. It may be that Krebs and Dawkins’s implicit prediction, that signalling can occur when a conﬂict of interests exists, is in fact true, but can only be demonstrated in a more complex game with a range of signal costs. The simple signalling game (see Figure 3.2) was therefore extended to incorporate signals of differing costs.

52

Jason Noble

In the extended game, the signalling player has three options: not signalling, which costs nothing; using the ‘soft’ signal, which costs CS, and using the ‘loud’ signal, which costs 2CS. Strategies in the extended game require specifying the signal to give when the hidden state is low or high and the response to give to no signal, soft signal and loud signal. The two strategies representing conspiratorial whispers or cheap signalling are (NS/Soft, Neg/Pos/Pos) and (NS/Soft, Neg/Pos/Neg). Both strategies call for the soft signal to be used in the high state, and for positive responses to the soft signal; they differ only in the response to loud signals. Neither of these strategies can strictly be considered an ESS on its own (because neutral drift can take the population from one to the other) but it can be shown that the set of all mixed strategies involving these two is an ESS under the familiar conditions:
PS > CS > 0 PR > CR > 0.
Costly signalling would involve the use of the loud signal for the high state, and either the soft signal or no signal to denote the low state, with a corresponding response strategy. None of the four strategies in this category can be an ESS. For example, (NS/Loud, Neg/Pos/Pos) cannot be an ESS assuming positive costs of signalling and responding. The similar strategy (NS/Loud, Neg/Neg/Pos) is almost stable if PS > 2CS, but can drift back to the previous strategy, which can in turn be invaded by the cheap strategy (NS/Soft, Neg/Pos/Pos).
Analysis of the extended game indicates that if signalling is favoured at all, then at equilibrium the signallers will always use the cheapest and the secondcheapest signal available (i.e. no signal and the soft signal). Further extensions of the game, by adding ever more costly signalling options, do not alter this conclusion. None of the costly signalling strategies can even be an ESS, let alone support communication in the face of a conﬂict of interests. The possibility of expensive signalling arms races starts to look remote. However, it may be that the discrete signals used in the games presented so far have had an unwarranted effect on the results.

9. Simulation Model with Continuous Signal Costs and Reception Threshold
A second evolutionary simulation was constructed, in which the cost of signalling was continuously variable. Signalling strategies were represented by two positive real numbers Clow and Chigh: the cost of the signals given in the low state and in the high state, respectively. Response strategies were represented by a real-valued threshold T; positive responses were given to signals

53

with costs greater than the receiver’s threshold value. Note that threshold values could be negative, indicating a positive response to any signal.
A real-valued GA was used to simulate the evolution of strategies over time. Generally, the same parameters were used as in the previous simulation model, e.g. a population of 100. Mutation was necessarily a different matter: each realvalued gene in each newborn individual was always perturbed by a random Gaussian value, µ = 0, σ = 0.05. If a perturbation resulted in a negative cost value the result was replaced by zero. In addition, 1% of the time (i.e. a mutation rate of 0.01) a gene would be randomly set to a value between 0 and 5 for signal costs, or between −5 and +5 for the threshold value. This two-part mutation regime ensured that offspring were always slightly different from their parent, and occasionally very different.
The CS parameter was no longer relevant, but CR, the cost of responding, remained ﬁxed at 1. Nonsignalling initial conditions were implemented by setting T to a random Gaussian (µ = 0, σ = 1) and then clamping Clow = Chigh = 0 for 100 generations of preliminary evolution.
Figure 3.4 shows the average values of the communication index. The results are qualitatively similar to those for the discrete simulation model: communication occurs in a limited region of the cooperative quadrant, and never outside it.
The continuous model also allows investigation of the cost and threshold values over the payoff space. Clow, the cost of the signal given in response to the low state, always remained close to zero – this was unsurprising as signallers

are ambivalent about the receiver’s response to the low state. However, the value of Chigh varied both inside and outside the region where communication was established: Figure 3.5 shows the mean values of Chigh. The signals given in response to the high state are most costly when PS, the payoff to the sender, is high and when the receiver’s net payoff is marginal, i.e. PR ≈ 1. In order to study this effect more closely, additional simulation runs were performed, with PS ﬁxed at 5 and PR varying between −5 and +5 in increments of 0.1. These runs can be thought of as exploring the cross section through PS = 5 in Figure 3.5. Figure 3.6 shows the cross-sectional mean values of Chigh. Note that the ‘energy’ devoted to signalling is at a maximum around PR = 1 and drops off as PR increases – it can be seen from Figure 3.4 that PR = 1 is approximately the point where signiﬁcant communication is established.
The threshold values showed corresponding variation. Figure 3.7 shows the mean value of T across the payoff space. The threshold values are typically very high (a ‘never respond’ strategy) or very low (an ‘always respond’ strategy), but in the region where communication evolved, receivers become progressively less demanding, i.e. T decreases as PR increases. Figure 3.8 shows the crosssectional results for PS = 5.
Figure 3.9 plots the mean cost of high and low signals and the mean reception threshold on a single graph. This makes the relationship between costs and threshold clear: at approximately PR = 1, the threshold falls to a level where the mean high-state signal generates a positive response. As PR increases, i.e. as the

two players’ payoffs approach each other, the signallers become less extravagant and the receivers less ‘sceptical’. This contradicts the game-theoretic result of the previous section, which implies that when signals of varying costs are available, either the cheapest pair of signals will be used, or no signalling will occur. That is, something like Figure 3.10 would be expected if the soft-loud signalling game accurately modelled the continuous case.
10. Discussion of Results
In all of the models presented, communication evolved or was predicted to evolve only within the cooperative region of the signaller-receiver payoff space. This means that no signalling at all (costly or otherwise) was observed when the signaller and the receiver were experiencing a conﬂict of interests. The ﬁrst game-theoretic model, in which discrete signals of varying costs are available, suggests that communication, if selected for, will use the cheapest pair of signals available. However, the second simulation model, incorporating the more realistic assumption that signals can vary continuously in cost, implies that cheap signals will only be used when both parties stand to gain a high payoff from effective communication. When the net payoff to the receiver is marginal, evolved signals will be more costly than strictly necessary to convey

58

Jason Noble

the information. The relationship is not symmetrical: when the net payoff to the signaller is marginal, a nonsignalling equilibrium, in which the receiver always responds positively, is likely to occur.
Krebs and Dawkins (1984) predicted that signalling would be costly if a conﬂict of interests existed, and strictly speaking, the results here neither support nor contradict their prediction, as no signalling occurred in the conﬂict-of-interest cases. However, although the results from the second simulation model do not conﬁrm Krebs and Dawkins’s conspiratorial-whispers theory, they deﬁnitely suggest a modiﬁcation of it. As Figure 3.9 shows, when the net payoff to the receiver is marginal, receivers will be sceptical and express ‘sales resistance’ by responding only to costly signals; signallers in turn will be prepared to invest more energy in ‘convincing’ receivers to respond positively. When communication is unambiguously good for both parties, signals are cheaper and response thresholds lower. Therefore both costly manipulative signals and conspiratorial whispers are expected to evolve, but in a much smaller region of the payoff space than Krebs and Dawkins’s theory suggests, i.e. within the cooperative region. Costly signals evolve when honest signalling is highly proﬁtable to the signaller, but only marginally so to the receiver. For example, if a juvenile beneﬁts by honestly signalling extreme hunger to its parent (because the parent responds by feeding it), but the net inclusive-ﬁtness payoff to the parent is only slight, then costly signals by the juvenile are expected.
There are two qualiﬁcations that must be made concerning the results. Firstly, the signalling game used is not likely to be a universal model of all possible communicative interactions. In particular, and despite having the same basic structure with two signals potentially used to transmit information about a binary hidden state, the signalling game differs from those employed by Hurd (1995) and Oliphant (1996). Hurd’s game models sexual signalling, and the male signaller is not ambivalent about the female receiver’s response when the hidden state is low; the signaller always prefers a positive response. A low hidden state maps to low male quality, a positive response represents a copulative episode, and even low-quality males want mating opportunities. The current signalling game, in contrast, cannot model so-called handicap signalling, because lowstate signallers do not care about what the receiver does. Furthermore, in both Hurd’s and Oliphant’s games, receivers are explicitly rewarded for accuracy in discerning the hidden state, but the game presented here allows the ecologically plausible outcome that receivers simply become disinterested in the signal. The current game is a reasonable model of situations such as alarm calls and food calls, in which potential signallers have no reason to care about what receivers do when no predator has been sighted or no food source has been found.

Evolution of Prelinguistic Communication

59

Secondly, it must be stressed that the simple games and simulations described here are in one sense an unfair way to test Krebs and Dawkins’s (1984) conspiratorial-whispers hypothesis. Krebs and Dawkins were discussing the likely evolution of signals in complex real-world cases, and could therefore appeal to the effects of differing mutation rates in signallers and receivers, and the exploitation of behaviours that had originally been selected for other purposes. Communication in the predicted costly signalling arms races was not expected to be stable. For example, in a real-world situation where it was not in the interests of receivers to respond positively to a particular signal from a predator, they might nevertheless continue to do so for some time if the signal was structurally similar to a mating signal made by members of the same species. The manipulative signalling system would break down as soon as an appropriate sequence of mutations resulted in organisms that could distinguish between the predator’s signal and the conspeciﬁc mating signal. In the simple signalling model all this complexity is abstracted into the base ﬁtness payoffs for signallers and receivers, and there is no guarantee that any transient, unstable evolved communication systems will be detected.

11. Implications for Theories of Language Evolution
Where does all this leave Knight (1998) and others who wish to use Krebs and Dawkins’s ideas as part of the foundations of a theory of language evolution? The simulations seem to show that the costly-arms-race/conspiratorial-whispers theory is simply not correct, at least not without modiﬁcation. However, that is only to say that communication is not expected to evolve under conditions of conﬂicting interest in a simple action-response game. The suspicion that it would have evolved (of which the author is manifestly guilty) can now be put down to careless interpretation of Krebs and Dawkins’s talk about the possibilities of ‘manipulative signals’. Thus we are reminded of the value of formal modelling: when considering Krebs and Dawkins’s verbal argument, it is easy to come away with the impression that communication will readily occur given a conﬂict of interests (and will involve high signal costs). The simulation models demonstrate the falsity of that impression.
Nothing has been established as to the success of Krebs and Dawkins’s theory in more complex scenarios, however. For example, a single communication system may be subject to contemporaneous cooperative and competitive usage, e.g. when social animals use the same signal repertoire to communicate with both in-group and out-group conspeciﬁcs, as Knight (1998) has suggested. Dessalles (1998, this volume) describes a scenario in which competition for social status

provides a new currency which can offset the costs of signal production. In such cases, costly signalling between agents with conﬂicting interests might well be evolutionarily stable – the issue is appropriate for further simulation modelling.
The immediate implications of the results presented should therefore not be overstated. Nevertheless, even such simple models start to put constraints on theories of protolanguage and language evolution. Given the results from the second simulation model, and supposing one suspects that language originated in the food and alarm calls of early hominids, then one has to establish that the balance of cooperative payoffs would have allowed communication to evolve. If one’s theory of language evolution requires low-cost signalling, then the ‘payoff window’ will be even narrower. It is through exploring these sorts of constraints that our theories about the evolution of simple signalling systems will eventually connect up with our theories about language.

Language and Hominid Politics
JEAN-LOUIS DESSALLES
1. Introduction: The Language Gap Language is the main distinctive feature of our species. Why do we feel the urge to communicate with our fellows, and why is this form of communication characterised by relevance – a feature unique in the animal kingdom? This chapter begins by stressing the speciﬁcity of human communication. We then challenge the claim that conversationalists are engaged in reciprocal altruism, arguing instead that the act of speaking must confer a selective advantage on the speaker. This advantage is elucidated by considering speech in its wider social and political context. Given what we know about ‘chimpanzee politics’ (de Waal 1982), it seems reasonable to suppose that ancestral humans were capable of forming large coalitions (cf. Dunbar 1996). We will suggest that relevant speech emerged in this context, as a way for individuals to select one another in forming alliances.
1.1. Uniqueness of Relevant Speech The way we communicate is unique among animal species. Speech differs from nonhuman animal communication not only in its sophisticated syntax and complex semantics. An additional unique feature is that speech must be ‘relevant’.
Relevance is a precise requirement which severely restricts what is acceptable in human conversation (Dessalles 1993, 1998). By human conversational standards, most messages exchanged in animal communication are ‘boring’. Repetitive territorial signalling, individual identiﬁcation, systematic threat displays – these cannot be considered genuine conversation. We expect human speakers to contribute novelty, to perform sound reasoning or to raise important issues. However, because we are immersed in relevant speech, we fail to recognise how peculiar the communicative behaviour of our species is. Human

conversation can be seen as a game in which something is to be won or lost. Think of how easily one may appear ridiculous when uttering a dull remark, especially if there is a large audience. People who repeatedly fail to make relevant points will not gain high social esteem. Conversely, speakers able to make pertinent statements or interesting comments on certain subjects are likely to become the focal point of the conversational group. From such a perspective, language appears more as a kind of ‘sport’ than as a way of communicating information.
This is not, of course, the usual way to consider linguistic ability. Language confers extraordinary advantages upon human groups. Individuals are enabled to share information and knowledge. They may coordinate the group’s actions more efﬁciently, keeping track of important events. Items of factual knowledge, innovations and memories become collective, extending social power well beyond the capabilities of single individuals. In this context, it might seem that the advantages of language are self-evident. Surely, every species would gain from possessing such an adaptation? In practice – according to this anthropocentric line of reasoning – only one species succeeded in developing language, but others started along the path leading to this remarkable achievement. Primates such as chimpanzees or gorillas appear to have remained at the gates of the Promised Linguistic Land. But their backwardness stems merely from quantitative limitations: they are not clever enough to manipulate abstract concepts, or their brain is not large enough to hold a sufﬁciently large vocabulary. This is not, however, the scenario we advocate.
Such accounts of language origin, which rely on quantitative factors, fail to explain the qualitative uniqueness of speech. Did other primate species lack sufﬁcient time to evolve symbolic thinking and language? There is no support for such a hypothesis. On the contrary, descriptions of evolution as a punctuated process (Gould and Eldredge 1977; Dessalles 1996) suggest that evolution can be rapid. The underlying mechanism, which may be termed implicit parallelism (Holland 1975; Goldberg 1989) is used in computer optimisation for its rapidity. The fact that genes are selected in parallel is not considered by those evolutionary accounts which insist on evolutionary speed limits (Worden 1998). With evolutionary changes occurring rapidly, species stay in equilibrium most of the time, occupying different adaptive local optima and thus differing qualitatively. Following Monod (1970), we consider early language to have contributed to the qualitative distinction between humans and apes.

1.2. Linguistic Relevance and Biological Relevance
The kind of content exchanged during conversation is not mere information. As Wa¨rneryd (1994: 407) states: ‘If we encounter people walking around uttering

64

Jean-Louis Dessalles

arbitrary true statements about the state of the world for no particular reason other than telling the truth, we will probably think of them as being insane’. Elsewhere (Dessalles 1993), I have provided a deﬁnition of conversational relevance. In order to be accepted as relevant, a new topic must be either about an unusual state of affairs or present some issue at stake. Facts or events that can be recognised as improbable, paradoxical, undesirable or desirable may thus count as relevant. We say that they contribute conversational information. ‘I damaged my neighbour’s brand-new car with my ladder’ may be said to friends, because they will worry about the consequences. In the utterance ‘I found a tiny medallion I lost last year in the forest’, friends may recognise a very unlikely, ‘unbelievable’ event and may be interested. However, one will not say ‘Jack lost a pound coin last year’ or tell stories such as ‘I woke up this morning, I took a shower, I dressed; then I had breakfast and listened to the news’. Being neither unusual nor (un)desirable, such events are not acceptable as topics of conversation.
Whenever people are brought together, their attention is focused on ﬁnding something worth saying. If they fail, they would rather remain silent than utter a platitude. The task is far from trivial. Because most of us are experts at thinking up relevant utterances,1 we fail to appreciate the true value of this skill. Finding some event in the environment or in recent memory that will contribute conversational information requires sophisticated cognitive abilities. The event must be perceived as unusual by addressees, or should appear as positive or negative. Such topics are, by deﬁnition, not easy to ﬁnd. Admittedly, the relevance threshold varies according to the social context. Making an interesting statement is much easier when talking to one’s best friend than when addressing a large audience. In the latter case, we devote all our attention to the task.
The knowledge we require in order to survive and prosper in human societies is learned mostly through conversation; only a minor portion comes through direct personal experience. We may recall the fate of deaf children who have no access to sign language. Deprived of the experience that other people offer in context during conversation, they may face difﬁculties in ﬁtting into society (Kegl, Senghas and Coppola 1999: 199). What conversationalists make available is not simply information; it is relevant information. Relevant information is more likely to be useful (Dessalles 1998): biologically signiﬁcant events are often unusual, or positive or negative, while events which are both common and neutral have no reason to attract attention. In short, conversational relevance is a good indicator of biological relevance.
If conversational information is so useful, we may wonder why speakers make every effort to offer it for free. Let us consider ﬁrst the possibility that such behaviour is based on symmetrical cooperation between individuals.

Language and Hominid Politics

2. Beyond Symmetrical Cooperation
The notion that human language relies on symmetrical cooperation between individuals seems at ﬁrst glance self-evident. Conversation, which is the most common and universal use of language, involves participants who alternate between speaking and listening. Speakers give one another sufﬁcient reliable, clear and relevant information for intended meanings to be understood (Grice 1975). Conversation, which relies on such solicitude, must be one of our most cooperative behaviours. Speakers express only the required amount of information to be clear and avoid being redundant. Then roles are reversed and the game continues.
However, I wish to offer a different, perhaps counterintuitive, picture of what is going on in linguistic exchange. I will suggest that there is no more cooperation between speaker and audience than between a ﬁgure skater and her judges. Both sides agree to play according to precise rules, but pursue quite different goals. One might then of course wonder why interlocutors exchange roles, if not to insure symmetrical cooperation. Besides the fact that such symmetry is far from systematic, I will consider an alternative explanation for such alternation.

2.1. Evolution of Symmetrical Cooperation
Cooperation is often claimed to be a prime cause of human sociality including language (Wilson 1978). A natural hypothesis is that language is based on reciprocation: A gives valuable information to B because B will give valuable information to A in return. This seems to be the obvious reason why conversation, this strange alternation of communicative moves, exists at all. Likewise, social bonds, friendship, the ability to coordinate collective action and altruistic acts would all result from the same ability to engage in inter-individual cooperative games (Wilson 1978). There are, however, several problems with symmetrical cooperation. One of them is that it may collapse in the presence of ‘cheaters’, who may beneﬁt from the ﬁrst move while failing to reciprocate. In the case of language, the presence of pure listeners is indeed a problem for the cooperation hypothesis. Relevant speech has a cost: those who provide information must spend time and energy ﬁnding interesting topics. If relevant conversational information is fruitlessly given to pure listeners, it is not only a waste of time and energy, but also a way of helping potential genetic competitors (Dessalles 1998). We should thus predict the disappearance of communicators.
A possible defence against pure listeners is for speakers to remember who cooperates and who does not, talking in future only to responsive individuals. This strategy is not absolutely safe, though. To illustrate the problem, let us

66

consider the simulation presented in Figures 4.1–4.3. The simulation models the evolution of a population of ﬁve hundred individuals. They mate, reproduce and eventually die after a few ‘years’ or because their ‘vitality’ becomes too low. Following reproduction, ageing and random accidents decrease vitality and cause deaths until the population reverts to ﬁve hundred individuals. Two genes, C and R, are introduced in the population. These genes are at different positions on the genome, so that each individual may carry both, only one or neither. When an individual carries C, it chooses a fellow and gives it valuable information, which translates into vitality points. If this second individual carries R, it gives information back. Each of these behaviours has a cost, but both individuals eventually beneﬁt from the cooperation. On the other hand, if the addressee is not an R-carrier, it remains unresponsive. It beneﬁts from the information given while incurring no cost, and the speaker has lost its time. Under such conditions, R-carriers tend to be rare, causing C-carriers to die out (Figure 4.1).
There have been many attempts to stabilise the evolution of cooperative strategies by introducing cheat detection (Axelrod 1984; Frean 1996; Ferriere and Michod 1996; Nakamaru, Matsuda and Iwasa 1997; Macy and Skvoretz

1998). When no retaliation is possible in the case of cheating, the basic idea is to diminish the relative importance of the random ﬁrst step, and thus to increase the reliability of subsequent moves by exclusively addressing responsive individuals. In Figures 4.2 and 4.3, individuals ‘mark’ responsive individuals so as to preferentially address them in subsequent trials. Evolution of the frequency of each strategy in the population over time is observed. Results crucially depend on the value of some parameters: the proﬁt made when receiving information, the cost of producing information and the efﬁciency of ‘marking’ responsive individuals. For a very broad range of these parameters, we observe oscillations (Figure 4.3). These are due to the fact that in their ﬁrst trial, speakers have no way to discriminate against unresponsive individuals. If speakers are numerous,2 there is considerable advantage in remaining unresponsive and waiting to be randomly chosen. Consequently, the frequency of both respondents and speakers tends to decrease.2 Conversely, when responsive individuals are rare, they take advantage of being repeatedly chosen for cooperation. They begin to increase in frequency, as do speakers. These conﬂicting effects explain why frequencies tend to ﬂuctuate widely over time.
This simulation may help us to determine whether symmetrical cooperation can explain the evolution of human communication. The situation depicted in Figure 4.3 is not dynamically stable. It is not consistent with the evolution of complex faculties, because it creates no selection pressure. To verify this fact, we introduced two versions of each gene in the simulation. C1 and C2 are communication genes. Both induce their carrier to initiate communicative acts. With C1, however, the speaker gives only a fraction of the information it would have conveyed with C2. Similarly, R1-carriers return only a fraction of what R2-carriers return to the speaker. If the cooperative scenario were a sound explanation of the origin of communication, we would expect selection pressures

The sophisticated features of language – the ability to process about ten phonemes per second, to use complex syntax including recursive structures, case marking and agreement, the existence of a complex conceptual semantics and the ability to control relevance – could not have evolved by accident. There must have been strong selective pressures driving the evolution of capacities for increased precision and expressive power. Can we reproduce such a selection pressure in our simple simulation? The answer is no. Figure 4.4 shows no clear dominance of either allele C1 and C2 over the other. Figure 4.5 shows a similar negative result for alleles R1 and R2. Comparable results have been obtained for iterated cooperation: when individuals can choose intermediate levels of cooperation, several strategies coexist (Frean 1996).

69

The situation illustrated in Figure 4.2 seems more promising. It depends, however, on particular values of parameters: high payoffs, low costs and reliable cheater discrimination. These three favourable characteristics are needed to obtain dynamic stability and thus to enable selection pressures to arise. Unfortunately, human communication matches none of these three requirements. Most of the time, conversation provides no signiﬁcant payoff. Even if acquiring information is proﬁtable in the long run, immediate beneﬁts are far from being guaranteed. Are the costs associated with language especially low? Talk is sometimes said to be ‘cheap’. We stressed, however, the fact that being relevant requires all our cognitive resources and presupposes expenditure of time in acquiring information. This is not a negligible cost. Lastly, it is not the case that speakers perform work in checking up on cheats, as will now be shown.

2.2. Inverse Cheat Detection
Given a model of communication based on symmetrical cooperation, we would expect cheat detection to be performed by speakers attempting to ensure reciprocation by addressees. This prediction is not conﬁrmed. Consider the following example:
Context: A and B have been having trouble with humidity in their house. The house was not heated over the weekend, and their clothes are still cold in the wardrobe.
A1: It’s also wet in here! (in the wardrobe) B1: It isn’t wet. It’s cold.
In A1, A draws attention to a very undesirable state of affairs: she (wrongly) believes that the clothes are wet. A1 contributes conversational information (cf. Section 2.1.) and is thus relevant. B’s reply can be naturally understood as a cooperative act. B1 would help A to correctly assess the situation. Maybe this is B’s subjective feeling. Face-to-face cooperation is generally understood as a symmetrical process: what A gives to B and what B returns to A are of the same nature. This is not, however, what happens here. Contrary to A1, B1 contributes no conversational information. The fact that the clothes are cold is neither unusual nor (un)desirable. Its relevance must be understood in relation to A1. If B’s statement is true, then the situation described in A1 is no longer undesirable. In other words, the objective effect of B1 is to cancel the information contained in A1.
Conversation is inherently asymmetrical. It is not a mere succession of informative statements, as a model based on face-to-face cooperation would lead us to expect. When a relevant topic has been introduced, addressees’ replies either

70

Jean-Louis Dessalles

reinforce or diminish the conversational information contributed by the speaker (Dessalles 1993). This is what we observed with B1. Conversational structure emerges from an alternation between information and evaluation (Dessalles 1993). To perform such evaluation, interlocutors often try to show that a previous utterance is inconsistent with what they know. Logical consistency is indeed an efﬁcient test of reliability: it is very difﬁcult to lie and remain consistent. A possible conjecture is that logical thinking evolved as part of the listener’s ability to evaluate the quality of information.
The behaviour of addressees during conversation fails to match expectations of the symmetrical cooperation scenario. If cheat detection is occurring, it is being undertaken not by speakers – as the cooperative scenario would lead us to expect – but by listeners. This role reversal is totally mysterious if we see in conversation a cooperative game. The only viable strategy is for cooperative speakers to detect and penalise uncooperative addressees. The inverse situation, in which it is listeners who are ‘choosy’, is in this context inexplicable. It does make sense, however, if we depart from the model of symmetrical cooperation.

3. Language and Coalition Formation
3.1. A Social Role for Language
In his book Chimpanzee Politics, de Waal (1982) shows the importance of coalitions in the social organisation of our sister species. Humans are nevertheless unique in one respect: we form especially large coalitions. Dunbar (1966) suggests that language may have played a crucial role in organising these, arguing that linguistic exchanges perform social bonding functions and typically concern social affairs. People are brought together to gossip about the behaviour of others in the group. By denouncing uncooperative individuals, interlocutors reinforce their own solidarity.
Gossip seems to be a very common use of language. However, I do not agree that it can explain the emergence of language. First, information about social ‘cheaters’ is valuable. Why would people willingly give such information to one another? We are back to the difﬁculty highlighted in the preceding section: if gossip is a form of cooperation, how could it emerge through natural selection? It is precisely the efﬁciency of language for social bonding highlighted by Dunbar – the fact that speech reaches several individuals simultaneously – that is also an argument against the symmetrical cooperation scenario (Power 1998). Moreover, we do not see how the gossiping function could determine the speciﬁc way we communicate. Language can be used to convey any kind of information, provided it is relevant. We are not bound to talk about social

Language and Hominid Politics

71

facts, but we are bound to utter relevant messages. The need to exchange social information does not explain relevance. Relevance, however, does explain gossip. Social misbehaviour, when it is unusual or may have harmful consequences, matches our deﬁnition of relevance. Social relationships indeed prove to be an inexhaustible source of relevant information. Yet not all social facts are relevant. Certain forms of misbehaviour might not seem especially unusual or (un)desirable to the participants. In these cases, such behaviour could not be a topic of conversation.
Gossip is at best a secondary function of language; there is no evidence of any inﬂuence it could have had on the design of the language faculty. If there is a primary social function that constitutes a causal factor of language evolution, this function must still be determined.

3.2. Language as a Heterogeneous Exchange
We have seen that any plausible model of language based on cooperation leads to evolutionary instability. Moreover, while such models rely on cheat detection by speakers, observation suggests that such detection is performed instead by listeners. For these two reasons, symmetrical cooperation cannot be the causal factor in the evolution of language. A possible solution to the puzzle of language evolution is to consider that speakers have something to gain by using language to make relevant points, something different from mere reciprocation. We have suggested elsewhere that relevant information is exchanged for social status (Dessalles 1998). Such exchange is asymmetrical, and does not require faceto-face cooperation.
If relevant information were given to obtain social status, it would explain speakers’ willingness to make their contributions as clear and interesting as possible (cf. Grice 1975). From a biological perspective, a communicative behaviour which would give access to social status would have a high selective value. Higher social status among primates is indeed correlated with enhanced reproductive success. Social status in human societies is a complex notion, which goes from esteem granted by friends to ofﬁcial social rank. Status is not always explicitly displayed in tangible form. It may be an emergent attribute resulting from a complex combination of attitudes adopted by other individuals – attitudes such as respect, esteem, deference, loyalty, allegiance, admiration, honour, homage or worship. For the purpose of this chapter, we will adopt a simpliﬁed notion of status, retaining only three features: (1) social status is correlated with biological ﬁtness, (2) it emerges from others’ appraisal of some deﬁnite quality Q, and (3) it is correlated with some form of inﬂuence or leadership within coalitions.

72

Jean-Louis Dessalles

From characteristics (1) and (2), we understand how communicative ability can become biologically meaningful: if Q is competence in contributing relevant information, then relevant individuals will have a selective advantage. The high regard in which eloquent individuals are held has often been acknowledged (Locke 1998). As we will see, characteristic (3) is also an essential hypothesis of the model. It is what makes the model ‘political’. By deﬁnition, coalitions are groups of individuals showing solidarity in action, i.e. being able to take collective decisions. Hypothesis (3) presupposes that higher status individuals are better able to inﬂuence others in taking collective action.
If we accept the assumptions of the model, we understand why cheat detection is performed by listeners (as observed earlier) and not by speakers (as cooperative scenarios wrongly predict). Because of its political signiﬁcance, social status should not be attributed on unreliable grounds. If status is granted according to relevance, addressees must check the informational quality of what they hear, in order to avoid rewarding false or poor information. This explains the actual asymmetry of the conversational exchange at a given moment, with one individual contributing information while the others are checking for consistency and quality. The very existence of conversation as an alternation of argumentative moves is now exactly what one would expect. Conversation emerges from the wish of each participant to reach a correct appraisal of the information initially given. It is not an unstructured series of informative acts. What is at stake is whether the initial speaker’s point is worth giving her a bit of status. We do not claim that this is a conscious goal pursued by interlocutors. It only appears as a likely reason why, from an evolutionary perspective, our communicative behaviour was selected.
This scenario presents human communication as based on a heterogeneous trade – relevant information in exchange for status. It promises to give us a satisfactory explanation for why language was originally selected and why it takes the form of recurrent speech moves. Yet from an evolutionary perspective, the behaviour of addressees who reward good speakers with status remains mysterious. In what follows, we will look for reasons why listeners might willingly give status in exchange for relevant and reliable information. Our third hypothesis about status, namely its correlation with some form of inﬂuence or leadership, will show its necessity.

3.3. Hominid Politics
Chimpanzees may form alliances in establishing leadership over the whole group (Goodall 1971; de Waal 1982). Typically, two or three subordinate male individuals may cooperate to defeat the group leader and take over power. As

Language and Hominid Politics

73

a result, they have privileged access to common resources and to mates. If we follow Dunbar’s (1996) account of early hominid social organisation, our ancestors’ coalitions were larger and more systematic than in other primate societies. Coalitions are associations based on solidarity. As such, they offer some security to their members. But coalitions are more than that. The power of single individuals is limited by comparison with what a sufﬁcient number of allies can achieve. Leadership of a group cannot be exercised without support from at least some of its members. As a consequence, individual competition for leadership is replaced, when coalitions are established, by competition between coalitions. In this context, physical strength is far less important than the ability to enter a successful coalition. The analogy with politics as we know it in modern societies is quite close. We suggest that our remarkable communication system evolved in this context.
To understand the consequences of this new type of organisation with respect to the evolution of behaviour, we must consider the strategic options open to individuals. The best strategy would of course be to join a coalition which will accept the newcomer and which presents the best chances to succeed in the political competition. On which grounds should one take the decision to join? In primate societies, the company of strong individuals is much sought after. From the perspective we propose, relevant information may have replaced physical strength as a determining factor in the decision to join a coalition and remain in it. Coalition formation and maintenance would thus rely on the same mechanism. We suggest that others’ ability to utter relevant messages is what individuals appraise before deciding to join a coalition or to remain in it. In the next subsection, we propose a simple simulation which shows that such an account is consistent: a behaviour like language can evolve as a reliable strategy in a context of political competition between coalitions.

3.4. A Simpliﬁed Account of Language Origin
The simulation used to illustrate the coevolution of status and communication was designed to offer a consistent account. It is of course oversimpliﬁed. The notions of coalition, information, status and leadership bear only little resemblance to their sociological counterparts. In particular, the fact that status increases the inﬂuence on collective decisions is implemented by considering one leader per coalition. The objective here is simply to arrive at a consistent scenario that can then be used as the basis for further reﬁnements.
We consider again a population of several hundred individuals who carry two genes C and R. C-carriers (speakers) make the ﬁrst step by choosing another individual to whom information is given. This is costly to the speaker. Speakers all

differ in their ability to give information. Some random nongenetic coefﬁcient P, given to them at birth, affects the quantity of information they are able to convey. R-carriers join the coalition of good speakers. To do so, they record the best information given to them in preceding interactions, and decide to follow new speakers on the basis of their relevance. At this point, the game is evolutionarily neutral: individuals exchange information and move between coalitions.
Periodically, coalitions confront each other in a contest. Coalitions are ranked according to the intrinsic value, i.e. the coefﬁcient P of their ‘leader’. When an individual joins the coalition of a speaker, the latter automatically receives ‘status points’. The leader of a coalition is the individual with maximum status. After the contest, individuals are rewarded according to the relative performance of their coalition and according to their own status within the coalition. Figure 4.6 shows how both genes, C and R, are eventually carried by virtually all individuals in the population (if we exclude the residual noise due to mutations). We now explain the role of the different concepts introduced in the model.
Communicative competence. Individuals differ in their ability to communicate. Individuals who lack gene C remain silent. The communicative performance of individuals carrying C depends on their competence and on a random modulation affecting each communicative act. The competence, stored in coefﬁcient P, is randomly determined at birth, and remains constant throughout life.
Political competition. The performance of a coalition depends on the competence of its leader. The core of the scenario is that this political competence is correlated with the ability to extract relevant information from the environment and to communicate it. This is a strong, fundamental feature of the model.
Status and coalition membership. Status is considered to be an emergent property. In our simpliﬁed model, status ‘points’ are objectively assigned by followers of successful speakers. Status thus results from several interwoven

acts of allegiance. Real coalitions are often not materially deﬁned. There is no union card to reify friendship, esteem or alliances. Individuals may manifest their adherence to a given coalition by showing interest in other members of that coalition. This is what we mean by an act of ‘allegiance’ or ‘following’; coalition members with ‘followers’ gain status from such acts. Our interpretation of status is consistent with Dunbar’s (1996) grooming metaphor: listeners in effect ‘groom’ relevant speakers.

Information. The intrinsic value of information as such is not so important in this model. We have stressed elsewhere (Dessalles 1998) the potential value of relevant information for listeners. Even if this remains a valid hypothesis, it is not necessary for the model. The potential signiﬁcance of relevant information for listeners’ survival may be a mere by-product of the relevance requirement. What is necessary for the emergence of communication in our model is rather the correlation between speakers’ ability to produce relevant information and their capacity to exert a salutary inﬂuence on their coalition.

To continue the political metaphor, we may say that individuals are involved in an ongoing electoral process. Relevant information is used to advertise one’s ability to lead the coalition. Our simulation indicates that language becomes a stable strategy in this context. It is a good strategy for speakers, because they obtain status. The more status, the more chances to be rewarded after the political competition. The strategy of followers, compared to those who lack gene R, is also proﬁtable. The coalition they join is more likely to be successful, because (1) it already contains a competent speaker, (2) this speaker, or a still better one, is likely to achieve leadership and (3) the success of the coalition is correlated with the competence of its leader.
Could language evolve under such circumstances? This time, the answer is yes. In the experiment depicted in Figure 4.6, there were actually two alleles C1 and C2 of C. When C1 is present in the genome rather than C2, the individual utters only a fraction of the information that it would have conveyed with C2. Figure 4.7 shows that C2 wins decisively over C1. We conclude that there is a selection pressure leading to the expression of the best possible information. Still in the same experiment, there was an allele R of R in the population. An individual who carries R does not respond to speakers, instead randomly joining an individual, who thereby gains status. Figure 4.8 compares the frequencies of R, R and non-R/non-R as they evolve. We see that R wins over the two other alleles. The (responsive) follower’s strategy appears to be evolutionary stable.
This simulation is of course a simpliﬁcation. In human relationships, leadership is gradual and context-dependent. The model simpliﬁes this relative and

gradual inﬂuence by considering only the leader’s role. Status, as understood in this model, represents a weight affecting the inﬂuence of individuals on collective decisions. The model nevertheless indicates that the coevolution of status and language is a sound scenario.
4. Discussion
It has been shown that language could have evolved in a context of political competition between coalitions. In this model, individuals use language to advertise their competence in producing relevant information. A central assumption is that individuals most competent in this respect are those best able to contribute to coalitionary success in political competition. If we look for qualities likely to give better chances to be politically effective, the ability to spot unusual events or to anticipate desirable or undesirable outcomes seems a good candidate. If

we accept this, then the ability to be relevant is a reliable indicator of potential success and thus a good reason to be followed. This is enough for the communication of relevant information to emerge. The strategies leading to this emergence may be formulated as the following maxims: (1) be as relevant as you can, (2) check the consistency and relevance of information contributed by others and (3) try to establish friendship with genuinely relevant individuals.
Our status-based model of language evolution bears some resemblance to Zahavi’s model of prestige. We have claimed that language is used to advertise some competence, namely ‘political’ competence. Its function may therefore be compared in certain respects to that of other forms of animal signalling. For instance, babblers seem to compete over apparently altruistic acts like food sharing and sentinel activities (Zahavi and Zahavi 1997). Such behaviour cannot result from symmetrical cooperation: ‘If guarding were based on reciprocity, there would be no point in striving to do more guard duty than others’ (Zahavi and Zahavi 1997: 135) (emphasis in original). The birds behave this way when they can be witnessed by other individuals, in order to gain ‘prestige’. There is thus no need to invoke face-to-face cooperation to explain these apparently altruistic behaviours. Zahavi’s theory of prestige provides no evolutionary account of status allocation, though. Our political model of language as a signalling behaviour is not only consistent with Zahavi’s theory of prestige, but in addition explains why status should be given to relevant individuals. From Zahavi’s perspective, on the other hand, there remains a problematic issue concerning language. Words are cheap, but only costly signals are reliable. Babblers do not hesitate to engage in costly signalling: they take real risks when serving as sentinel, and lose opportunities to feed when sharing food. Being costly, such behaviour is hard to fake. An overcautious sentinel is not a sentinel, and food sharing cannot be simulated. The case of language is thus enigmatic:
We don’t know how symbolic word language evolved in humans. . . . The rub is that verbal language does not contain any component that ensures reliability. It is easy to lie with words. (Zahavi and Zahavi 1997: 222–223)
Since linguistic acts are so cheap, how can they be reliable indicators of a genuine competence? We suggested above that logic could have evolved as a powerful way to make lying very hard. If we accept this hypothesis, then relevance still appears difﬁcult to achieve. Even if speech itself is not costly, relevance requires continuous effort and attention. Information gathering and processing needs much investment. This may explain why our species can be said to be ‘information-oriented’: some individuals spend part of their lives trying to collect original information on speciﬁc subjects and to become recognised specialists.

We dismissed symmetrical cooperation as a causal factor in language evolution. This does not preclude, however, the possibility that language generates phenomena that are altruistic or cooperative. Offering valuable information, like offering food, is genuinely altruistic, even if it is biologically motivated by the possibility of gaining status. Similarly, language can be seen as a form of emergent cooperation, which differs from face-to-face cooperation. When competing for relevance and for status, individuals behave for the good of the group. But this kind of emergent cooperation is an effect, not a cause, of our status-oriented social organisation.
We concluded earlier that face-to-face cooperation played no causal role in the evolution of language. This does not mean that this form of cooperation cannot exist. Axelrod (1984) showed that external policing, by deterring cheaters, can ensure reliable symmetrical cooperation. The problem is that policing itself is altruistic. In our ‘political’ model, the ability to perform efﬁcient policing might emerge through being rewarded with status, as did the ability to communicate relevant information. The only requirement is that policing be correlated with coalitionary success. In a context in which policing exists, many forms of symmetrical cooperation become possible, including speciﬁc forms of language use. This conclusion is close to Knight’s (1998) claim about the possibility of cooperative symbolic communication among individuals bound together by costly rituals. The risk of being excluded from the coalition by some form of policing is highly dissuasive, because it means losing the large investment necessary to become a member. The use of costly rituals as a means of guaranteeing solidarity and cooperation within the coalition may have led to the emergence of symbolic culture in our species (Knight 1991). However, costly membership does not prevent cheating if there is no form of policing. The point is that some individuals may beneﬁt in terms of status through enforcing loyalty among coalition members.
The sketch of the evolutionary origin of language provided in this chapter is of course far from complete. It addresses the problem of the qualitative difference between speaking and nonspeaking species. In our account, conversational competence, i.e. the ability to make interesting, relevant points, is a way to advertise one’s ‘political’ competence. Human societies, primitive or not, are complex webs of coalitions. Individual success crucially depends on the ability to form efﬁcient coalitions and to acquire status. Social status among humans is not extorted by brute force. It emerges from others’ willingness to establish social bonds with you. The decision to become closer to somebody is taken according to deﬁnite criteria. Linguistic relevance may be an essential component of this choice.

Notes
1. The notion of relevance is deﬁned here as contributing ‘conversational information’. It is a more restrictive deﬁnition than that proposed by Sperber and Wilson (1986). See Dessalles 1998 for a comparison.
2. What we call speaker and respondent here corresponds to a priori independent strategies. A given individual may adopt either strategy, or none, or both of them, depending on its genetic constitution.

Secret Language Use at Female Initiation: Bounding Gossiping Communities
CAMILLA POWER
The idea that ‘gossip’ or vocal exchange of social information was a vital mechanism for bonding early human groups appears plausible and concretely testable (Dunbar 1996, 1998; Dunbar, Duncan and Nettle 1995). The relatively rapid encephalisation seen in archaic-grade Homo sapiens is presumed to reﬂect the increasing size and complexity of these hominids’ social groups (Aiello and Dunbar 1993). Vocal grooming in the ﬁrst place and ultimately gossip offered alternative mechanisms for servicing such extensive social networks, because they saved valuable time compared with the traditional primate means of manual grooming.
This ‘time-saving’ argument leads to a serious problem for the gossip hypothesis of language origins, however. As our ancestors maximised brain size in response to the pressure for larger groups, they maximised their ‘Machiavellian intelligence’ (Byrne and Whiten 1988; Whiten and Byrne 1997). Humans appear to be selected for a capacity involving both social cooperation and alliance formation, but also manipulation and exploitation of their relationships. We cannot consider gossip as a mechanism of social bonding without factoring in this Machiavellian aspect of manipulating information for selﬁsh purposes (cf. Kemmerer 1997). In the case of primate grooming, time becomes a currency (Byrne 1995: 200–202). The time an individual spends grooming an ally reliably quantiﬁes its commitment to their relationship. Correspondingly, if vocal grooming and gossip mechanisms led to a reduction in time spent grooming per individual groomed, this implies a reduction in the level of commitment signalled to each individual (not necessarily equally distributed). Hence, while archaic Homo sapiens had larger numbers of allies than any previous hominid, those more numerous alliances would have been less intrinsically reliable.
This anomaly led Power (1998) to argue that for gossip to function as a means of social bonding, it necessarily coevolved with another independent mechanism for establishing commitment to alliances. Raising the costs, in terms

of time and energy, of forming coalitions safeguards against exploitation by ‘freeriders’ – those who accept beneﬁts of social cooperation without paying the costs (Enquist and Leimar 1993; Dunbar 1999). Knight (1998) posits costly ritual performance as the means for securing trustworthy long-term alliances and sealing the boundaries of speech communities. Deacon (1997: 403–410) similarly argues that ritual cements the contractual obligations which underlie symbolic communication.
In this chapter, I will investigate speciﬁc forms of initiation ritual, drawn predominantly from ethnographic accounts of Bantu groups. In recent history, these rituals may have functioned to demarcate communities within which gossip was assumed to be reliable. In particular, I will look at how forms of special or secret language are integrated with ritual acts to provide mechanisms that prevent freeriding. What factors lead to the elaboration of such mechanisms, and do these factors correlate with increased risk of freeriding or defection from gossiping alliances? Can these case studies of the interface between linguistic and ritual signals in complex modern societies shed light on the politics of communication among Machiavellian gossiping hominids? If gossip is a means of social bonding, should it be modelled as a reciprocal trade of information (Enquist and Leimar 1993) or as a trade of relevant information for status (Dessalles 1998)?

A Prototype for Ritual: Cosmetics and Female Coalitions
In Dunbar’s model for the emergence of gossip, the process is driven by the need for living in larger groups, which compromised social time budgets. Can we model a coevolutionary process giving rise to costly ritual behaviour, resulting from the same selection pressure?
Among primates, the ability to monitor relationships and alliances appears to be limited by relative neocortex size (Dunbar 1992). Pressure for larger groups leads to a greater requirement for coalitionary alliances to act as buffers against the increasing stress of group living. Under the Machiavellian intelligence or social brain hypothesis, this in turn leads to selection for larger-brained individuals. The costs of encephalisation would drive changes in behaviour to alleviate the increasing reproductive stress on females (Power and Aiello 1997; Key and Aiello 1999). Time and energy budgets of female hominids would have been most severely compromised as they were selected to produce more encephalised offspring. This implies that it was females who initially developed more efﬁcient means of servicing alliances, to reduce social time budgets as a direct result of the costs of encephalisation (cf. Dunbar 1996: 148ff., 1998: 99).

Larger group sizes also result in increased opportunities for freeriders. Factors such as size, mobility and dispersal of population affect the rate at which cheats will encounter naive individuals whom they may exploit (Enquist and Leimar 1993). Prisoner’s dilemma simulations suggest that gossip (exchange of information about others’ behaviour) can function as an effective countermeasure against social cheats (Enquist and Leimar 1993, Dunbar 1999). But these models generally assume without question the uniform reliability of such gossip. In real life, that reliability will be affected by many factors including kin relatedness, rank, age and sexual strategies.
The high energetic costs of encephalisation for females imply that a key area where cheating – and exchange of information about cheats – will critically affect reproductive success is in contexts of mating. Early desertion by a mate and subsequent loss of parental investment could compromise offspring survival, or simply lengthen female interbirth intervals. The trade-offs between pursuing mating opportunities and channelling resources into current offspring will not be the same for both sexes (Hill and Kaplan 1988).
It is the asymmetry of the services exchanged between males and females that makes it so difﬁcult to establish reciprocity. Key and Aiello (1999) use prisoner’s dilemma models to investigate the evolution of cooperation as the energetic costs of reproduction rise. Female-female cooperation is the easiest to establish, since females share common goals and can exchange similar altruistic acts, such exchange being easy to monitor. By contrast, ‘cooperation between males and females is much more difﬁcult to establish and is likely to be much less common than intra-female cooperation since the currencies of exchange are usually very different’ (Key and Aiello 1999: 21). However, in certain conditions, according to Key’s simulations, males will cooperate with females even where females do not reciprocate. Such unconditional cooperation implies that a male may offer food or other services to a female and her offspring without guarantee of paternity or even of sexual access. But this strategy depends on two factors. Firstly, female energetic costs of reproduction must be much higher than male energetic costs. Secondly, females must develop strategies whereby males who fail to cooperate unconditionally are severely punished by long-term refusal to cooperate. Key and Aiello (1999: 25) suggest that such factors would have become operative during the late Middle Pleistocene (500,000–100,000 B.P.) period of encephalisation in late archaic to early modern Homo sapiens.
Crucially, in these models a form of male investment emerges without any requirement of paternity certainty. One speciﬁc model of female coalitionary strategies compelling male unconditional cooperation is the ‘sham menstruation/sex strike’ hypothesis (Power 1998; Power and Watts 1996; Power and Aiello 1997; Knight, Power and Watts 1995). Costly ritual behaviour and

symbolism arise as a result of reciprocal altruistic strategies between cycling and non-cycling female members of coalitions. From the viewpoint of a pregnant or lactating female, cycling females represent a threat, capable of diverting male investment away from the current partner. Male philanderers will be most interested in targeting cycling females, and speciﬁcally in locating menstruating females since this is a reliable indicator of imminent fertility. The menstrual signal is economically valuable: males should compete in providing mating effort for chances of access to a female who is soon to be fertile. In other words, males will be unconditionally cooperative with reproductively valuable menstrual females. A possible strategy for non-cycling females is to surround and control access to any local menstruating female, and to ‘borrow’ her signal. The signal could be ampliﬁed by use of blood-coloured substances, including pigment such as ochre, to broadcast to potential male provisioners that there is an imminently fertile female in the vicinity, but also to deter males from discriminating between cycling and non-cycling females. Through costly ritual performance, using dance and body paint, females signal to males: ‘we are all menstruating females’.
This strategy succeeds as long as non-cycling females receive some of the beneﬁts of male mating effort mobilised by the prospect of access to cycling females. It has an inbuilt reciprocity, since any fertile female alternates between cycling and not cycling. It also generates a basic sexual morality. Each time she menstruates, a female is put on the spot. Will she cheat on non-cycling females, and use her attractions for short-term gain? Or will she cooperate in using her attractions for the beneﬁt of a wider coalition? Power (1998) argued that in cooperating, a cycling female offered a costly and reliable signal of commitment to a long-term alliance with non-cycling members of the coalition. Once she herself was pregnant and subsequently lactating, she expected to receive reciprocal beneﬁts, derived from the signals of other cycling members of the coalition. Within such alliances of females who were sharing sexual signals and cosmetics to attract male investment, gossip would be established on a ﬁrm basis of trust.

Bantu Puberty Ceremonial: Cosmetics, Control and Secret Language
Puberty schools, for either sex, function as probationary periods, when behaviour, especially contact with the opposite sex, comes under strictest regulation. They feature centrally some trauma or ordeal which the candidate must endure to become a member of the adult community. Prior to initiation, individuals are not considered as responsible adults; their words carry no weight, they are not trustworthy (cf. Bellman 1984: 8). For girls particularly, the rites

85

advertise onset of fertility and act as a prelude to marriage, taking place in the context of extensive female coalitions.
The key examples of female initiation discussed here are the Venda vhusha/ domba complex, the Bemba chisungu and the Kpe (or Bakweri) liengu schools, all Bantu speakers. The sande bush school of the Mande-speaking Kpelle, a classic illustration from the literature on secret societies, is drawn on for comparison. The Bantu schools maintained operative ‘secret’ languages even as their male counterparts had virtually become defunct (Ardener 1956: 85–86; Blacking 1969b: 69, 74). Certain common features are identiﬁable which offer a standard template for African girls’ initiation.
First of all, the ceremonies were costly affairs. The girl’s immediate kin had to pay ritual experts, providing food for her throughout as well as for visitors at coming-out feasts. The girl herself was removed from the labour force for the lengthy periods of seclusion – several months or upwards of a year in traditional circumstances. The primary impact of economic changes under colonialism was the cutting of these costs by reducing the length of seclusion (Richards 1956: 133; Bellman 1984: 9). However, the generosity of provisioning, the numbers of people drawn into celebrations and the duration of the rituals directly reﬂected on the status of the girl and her kin (Richards 1956: 133–134).
Secondly, older women controlled access to the girl and would be highly aggressive to male interlopers (see e.g. Stayt 1931: 107). While certain men might act as ritual ofﬁcials, they often adopted a female identity, as if to stress the nonsexual, ritual relationship with the candidate (see e.g. Blacking 1969a: 10). Throughout, the subordinate status of the girl was repeatedly emphasised (Richards 1956: 67; Blacking 1969a: 6, 12; Bledsoe 1980: 68). One of several vivid metaphors for ﬁrst menstruation among the Venda is ‘to abuse the old ladies’ (Blacking 1969a: 9). This expression, known only to women, according to van Warmelo (1932: 39–40), indicates the tension between cycling and noncycling women.
Thirdly, there is advertisement of the girl’s imminent fertility, which happens even where she has already been betrothed and is about to marry. The primary medium for this is some kind of red cosmetic – ochre in the Venda case, red camwood among the Bemba and Kpe – which connotes menstruation and which is usually passed between the girl and female associates. The rituals follow a general form of the girl ﬁrst being made dirty and unkempt, then proceeding through a ritual immersion prior to an emergence ceremony which is highlighted by cosmetics.
These features of costly performance, control of access and coalitionary use of cosmetics match expectations of the ‘sham menstruation’ model for establishing alliances between cycling and non-cycling women. The last common

86

aspect concerns education, though it is not always clear what girls are really learning. Richards (1956) and Bledsoe (1980) challenge the functionalist view of puberty schools as an all-purpose tribal education in norms and values, from a perspective of close involvement in Bemba and Kpelle rites, respectively. According to Richards, there was little opportunity for any formal instruction. Girl candidates would be shoved out of the way, told not to look at what was going on and usually had their heads covered in blankets (Richards 1956: 126). If any useful information was handed out, comments Richards, ‘the candidates themselves would be the last people to have a chance of acquiring it’ (1956: 126). Both Richards (1956: 126–127) and Bledsoe (1980: 67) explicitly deny that girls acquire any practical skills that they would not have learned anyway.
Rather than practical classes, these rites are frameworks for transmission of social knowledge that is constructed as secret knowledge (cf. Bellman 1984: 6). What Bemba girls learn, contends Richards, is ‘a secret language’. One aspect comprises secret terms and rhymes which refer to speciﬁc actions and objects within the chisungu rite. Richards writes: ‘What seems to the educationist to be the most mumbo-jumbo and useless aspect of the whole affair may actually constitute one of the most prized items of information to the people concerned’ (1956: 127). A second aspect is a ‘secret language of marriage’, referring especially to the taboos that constrain the physical relationship of husband and wife. Bledsoe emphasizes that ‘what young initiates do learn in the bush schools is absolute obedience to Sande leaders’ (1980: 68), women who are believed to wield sanctions of infertility and death. One of the legends of sande is that girls are taught the art of poisoning food to keep husbands in line (Bledsoe 1980: 67). So, while a re´gime of total obedience is instilled in the girls, they are also being introduced to the secret arts of poisoning. Bledsoe takes this paradox to signify that the girls’ ultimate loyalty is not to their husbands but to the secret society leaders ‘who could command them to poison their husbands for serious transgressions against higher tribal authority’ (1980: 68).
The Bemba reveal similar metaphors linking women’s potential to contaminate with higher powers that may intervene between husband and wife. Because of a complex of beliefs around the magical inﬂuence of sex, blood and ﬁre, every wife takes strenuous precautions to ensure her menstrual blood does not come into contact with the family ﬁre (Richards 1956: 32–33). It is precisely these exigencies – an etiquette of blood and ﬁre – that form the core of chisungu doctrine, which her future husband hopes and expects his bride to be taught. So, the secret ‘knowledge’ transmitted in these rites involves both linguistic formulae referring to the one-off event of an initiation ceremony and metaphors representing a system of taboos which regulate a woman’s life persistently thereafter. When ritually enacted, these taboos invoke a moral authority superseding any mere
