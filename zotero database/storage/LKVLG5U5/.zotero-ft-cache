Language diversity and thought examines the Sapir-Whorf linguistic relativity hypothesis: the proposal that the grammar of the particular language we speak affects the way we think about reality. Adopting an historical approach , the book reviews the various lines of empirical inquiry which arose in America in response to the ideas of anthropolo­ gists Edward Sapir and Benjamin L. Whorf. John Lucy asks why there has been so little fruitful empirical research on this problem and what lessons can be learned from past work. He then proposes a new, more adequate approach to future empirical research . A companion volume , Grammatical categories and cognition, illustrates the proposed approach with an original case study. The study compares the grammar of American English with that of Yucatec Maya, an indigenous language spoken in southeastern Mexico , and then identifies distinctive patterns of thinking related to the differences between the two languages.

Studies in the Social and Cultural Foundations of Language
The aim of this series is to develop theoretical perspectives on the essential social and cultural character of language by methodological and empirical emphasis on the occurrence oflanguage in its communicative and interactional settings, on the socioculturally grounded "meanings" and "functions" of linguistic forms , and on the social scientific study of language use across cultures. It will thus explicate the essentially ethnographic nature of linguistic data, whether spontaneously occur­ ring or experimentally induced, whether normative or variational , whether synchronic or diachronic. Works appearing in the series will make substantive and theoretical contributions to the debate over the sociocultural-function and structural-formal nature of language , and will represent the concerns of scholars in the sociology and anthropology of language , anthropological linguistics, sociolinguistics, and socioculturally informed psycholinguistics.

Acknowledgments
I must first thank my teachers who stimulated , guided , and supported this work. Ruth and Robert Munroe , with whom I worked as an undergraduate , introduced me to the problems of culture and cognition . At the University of Chicago, where the present project was begun, my interdisciplinary orientation was consistently supported both within the Committee on Human Development and by the University as a whole. Robert LeVine long provided intellectual support , and to him lowe the insights that scholarly differences stem as much from disciplinary history and habitual methods as from principled theory and that true interdisci­ plinary work must therefore deal with these existing traditions and their diverse methods. Richard Shweder has been a patient and enthusiastic supporter of the project and has provided a critical perspective on social science methodology that has strongly affected the present work . David McNeill first introduced me to the history and problems of research on the relation of thought and language. Finally, Michael Silverstein, in addition to teaching me most of what I know about language, provided me with a model of how to balance critical analysis with constructive theory and method . I am also in his debt for the actual substance of his research , which informs the discussion at several levels, and for his steady support of this work over many years.
During the writing of this book I had the good fortune to have the intellectual and financial support of the Center for Psychosocial Studies in Chicago. I thank Bernard Weissbourd, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Center, for making my period of residence possible and for his and the Center's continuing commitment to integrative social science research. My involvement at the Center has been marked by continuing contact with a stimulating group of colleagues who have made this book better: Benjamin Lee , Elizabeth Mertz, Richard Parmentier, Moishe Postone, Lee Schlesinger, Greg Urban , and James Wertsch. Of these I must single out Ben Lee for special thanks as having given this project his personal and intellectual support during some difficult times.

Introduction
General orj,entation
This study examines the linguistic relativity hypothesis, that is, the proposal that diverse languages influence the thought of those who speak them. This has been an important issue in our intellectual tradition for several hundred years . How far back the concern can be traced is largely a function of how one understands the terms language and thought and how explicit an hypothesis one requires. Relatively contemporary formulations begin to appear in eighteenth-century Germany with the work of Machaelis, Hamann , and Herder (R. L. Brown , 1967; Koerner, 1977; Penn, 1972; Starn, 1980; cf. Aarsleff, 1982; Friedrich , 1986) . Interest continues in the nineteenth century, again particularly in Germany, and begins to separate from speculative philosophy, especially in the work of Wm. von Humboldt. In the twentieth century the main line of empirical research moves to America with the development of Boasian anthropology . There are undoubtedly important connections between this new work in America and the earlier nineteenth-century German work of Humboldt, Miiller, and Steinthal (Haugen , 1977; Hymes, 1963; Starn, 1980) , but there was fresh impetus too deriving from firsthand contact with the incredible diversity of native American linguis­ tic forms and from the emergence in contemporary anthropology of an anti-evolutionary project with an emphasis on the functionally and temporally equivalent value of these diverse languages (Stocking, 1974) .
The general roots of our interest in the problem of linguistic relativity have never been extensively examined, although this is an important problem (Lucy , 1985a; cf. Friedrich , 1986) . Such an analysis is beyond the scope of this book, which focuses almost entirely on an internal analysis of twentieth-century empirical research in America. However, an attempt is made within this framework to place the research in historical sequence so as to indicate more accurately the course of the evolving debate . This is important for two reasons. On the one hand ,
1

Language diversity and thought

most of the historical studies of the development of the hypothesis are seriously deficient in their characterizations of twentieth-century approaches. Most often this is because they do not understand the evolving tradition but rather focus on a given text in isolation . On the other hand, there is a consistent tendency by those conducting con­ temporary empirical research to read the works from earlier in this century without reference to or sympathy for their historical context and genuine achievements but only with reference to contemporary con­ cerns. A balanced and detailed contextual understanding of this earlier work is a prerequisite to building upon it.
Contemporary interest in the relation of linguistic diversity to thought springs from three central concerns. First , there has been growing recognition in recent decades of the central importance of semiotic phenomena in general and of language in particular in the social and behavioral sciences. The emphases can vary quite widely from assigning language a theoretical significance in the constitution of human thought and culture to simply noting its methodological importance as the primary source of data used in evaluating various theories in the human sciences. Many of these theories work with "language in general ," disregarding the diversity among languages. An hypothesis of linguistic relativity assigns special importance to language variation and raises problems for theories which have ignored this diversity.
Second, individual thought occupies a central position in most modern theories of human behavior as the immediate cause of or guide for overt behavior. This leads naturally to a concern with the nature and origins of thought itself. The claim that thought is "relative" in some way immedi­ ately creates serious problems for a wide assortment of theories which presuppose a commonality of thought everywhere . An hypothesis that thought is influenced by the varying particulars of language raises j ust this issue.
The final problematic governing research in this century concerns the reflexive implications of the notion of relativity. If there is a linguistic relativity, then it may create real dilemmas for the conduct of research , because researchers themselves are not exempt from these linguistic influences. Not only might there be difficulties in understanding or characterizing the forms of thought of those speaking other languages, but the very generality and validity of our own linguistically formulated theories are brought into question. A linguistic relativity, if there is such, will not only lie out there in the object of investigation but will also penetrate right into the research process itself. This "reflexivity" is a general problem in the social sciences (Lucy, 1988 ; 1992) .
In this respect the problem intersects with the more general issue of the development of a methodology (in the broad sense of methodology as a

Introduction

3

mode of inquiry) adequate to the goals of social science investigation . Thus, the hypothesis of linguistic relativity challenges assumptions which lie at the heart of much modern social and behavioral research namely its claim to be discovering general laws and to be truly scientific. This is also the reason that the topic generates controversy and even hostility among so many social and behavioral scientists.
In contrast to the widespread importance of and interest in the topic, there is a virtual absence of empirical research on the problem. The reasons for the absence of research are diver�e , but three principal ones can be identified. First , there is a common tendency to reduce or caricature the problem into a simplified form which can then be regarded as obviously true or obviously false . One construal of a rela­ tivity hypothesis is the claim that the specific structure of a language determines thought, in the sense that a self-conscious speaker can never be free from constraints imposed by it ; this is a view that nearly every­ one agrees is untenable. An alternative argument is the claim that variable structures of specific languages influence thought , in the sense that there may be some identifiable cognitive correlates (outside of the specifically linguistic realm) associated with using a particular language ; this is a view that nearly everyone can agree with. Thus , under either conceptualization there is really no reason to conduct research , because the hypothesis is either obviously true or obviously false. These reduc� tions (or simplifications) sidestep the crucial issues : what are the influ­ ences, how important are they, when and how do or can they operate, etc.
A second obstacle to research in this area is its inherently interdisci­ plinary nature . One must first have a grasp of how languages work . Usually this would involve an understanding of linguistics and of some auxiliary field encompassing some of the uses of language such as anthropology, folklore studies, or comparative literature . Secondly, one must have substantial knowledge of the domain of thought under con­ sideration . For some this has meant the contents of thought, that is, a speaker's conceptualizations of the world as part of a cultural system studied , for example , by cultural anthropologists or historians; for others this has meant the processes of thinking, that is, the activities of attending, remembering, reasoning, etc. as studied, for example, by cognitive psychologists . Either way , some knowledge other than the strictly linguistic is necessarily entailed. There may be further require­ ments depending on the approach taken . For example there are certain methodological skills required in linguistic analysis, for anthropological fieldwork , for experimental psychology, and so forth. Whichever of these are involved must also be mastered. This very real interdiscipli­ nary nature of the hypothesis represents a significant obstacle given the

4

Language diversity and thought

present state of research training, which sharply limits the acceptable topics and methods in most social science fields.
This leads directly to the third obstacle to research of this type , namely that it is intrinsically contrary to some of the central assumptions of the relevant disciplines. For example , the hypothesis, if correct , would jeopardize the assumption tacitly accepted by most psychologists that each individual can be conceptualized from a scientific standpoint as a psychological entity autonomous in both development and mature functioning. The notion that what is distinctive about human activity in contrast with other species lies precisely in its embeddedness in an historically transmitted social , linguistic, and cultural ecosystem is simply alien to most psychologists - widespread lip service to the importance of culture notwithstanding.
This psychological assumption endures for a variety of reasons, the most important perhaps being that the view of the individual as an autonomous entity is in harmony with our own cultural premises. It is difficult to recognize the relativity of one' s own psychological functioning and scientific theories. This would involve not only entertaining the possibility that the notion of the autonomous individual stems in large part from our own cultural norms and assumptions but also recognizing that there may be limits to the degree of human self-understanding achievable within the methodologically strict positive scientific paradigm.
Further, a reconceptualization of the individual as being to some degree intrinsically social would raise a number of difficult methodologi­ cal and conceptual problems which are more easily not faced. Recogni­ tion that the central objects of study in an individual psychology depend on radically different , socially constituted contextual systems would pose the need to formulate a general method (in the sense of global pro­ cedure) for conducting grounded comparison across such contexts where the presence of an a priori "objective" external framework is ruled out and where no specific individual case can rightly serve as a privileged standard for comparison. (This is a social [or cultural] version of the central problem in any psychology : how can any two individuals justifi­ ably be compared in a valid way?) Such a psychology would need to integrate into the investigation a broad range of methods (in the sense of specific techniques) , drawing on related , yet often unfamiliar, social science disciplines so as to address the full complexity of the issues adequately. Even the preliminaries for a comparative psychology of this sort remain undeveloped. This problem has its complement in the more "social" sciences, such as anthropology and sociology, which try to account for distinctively human social organization either without refer­ ence to a comprehensive theory of individual functioning or by gratuitous

Introduction

assumptions about the nature of such functioning. Most cultural accounts depend heavily on such assumptions.
These issues all come to a head in certain problems which by their very nature simply cannot be addressed in the traditional ways: the problem of linguistic relativity is one such problem . Incorporated within the very hypothesis itself is a question about the validity of generalizing to others on the basis of our own experience . What is required, as the empirical companion to this study will make clear, is that the problem must be formulated comparatively from the beginning. One does not formulate an approach without reference to other groups and then seek to "generalize" it or "test" it. Such an approach will guarantee misleading results because it must ultimately regiment and interpret the other groups in terms of our categories, categories that are demonstrably appropriate only for the first term of comparison .
The decision to focus on the relation between language and thought in this study stems directly from these various concerns. The study is conceived of as a contribution to the more general enterprise of develop­ ing the theoretical and methodological approaches necessary to address properly the intrinsically social and cultural nature of individual human psychological functioning. The linguistic relativity hypothesis offers several advantages in this regard. Languages are clearly different from one another, and the possible significance of such differences is a recognized problem within psychology. The reflexive (or self-critical) implications of linguistic influences on thought for the research enter­ prise itself are especially clear in this area, since language is the central intellectual tool in the social sciences. Further, the outline of a general comparative method for the investigation of language forms which is sensitive to both universal and variable factors is emerging within linguistics and can be instructive in guiding attempts to construct comparative methods in other domains . Finally, the emergence in recent years of a recognition of the relevance of linguistic phenomena to inquiries within a wide variety of social science disciplines offers an especially good opportunity for building interdisciplinary dialogue . Thus the relation of language and thought represents an ideal area in which to examine more general problems of the relation of individual and society. These broader issues ultimately motivate and structure the particular research reported here .

Focus of the present research
The present study focuses on the influence of linguistic diversity, cross-language variation in formal structure , on speakers' habitual

6

Language diversity and thought

cognitive responses to the world . There are , of course , a number of related problems which fall under the general heading of the inter­ relationship of language and thought, and which , in fact , bear on the discussion in important ways although they are not the focus here. Perhaps the best way to make clear the bounds of this work and to give preliminary content to the just-mentioned statement of focus is to contrast briefly the problem to be examined in this book with these related problem areas.
First , this study focuses on the influence of language on thought and not , for the most part , on the influence of thought on language . The latter concern is an important one and underlies many studies of language universals, language acquisition , and language as an index of cultural experience. Further, there are a great many studies of par­ ticular languages (e .g. , English) which purport to demonstrate the role of thought in determining language structure, but these are, on the whole , methodologically misguided since both cognitive performance and linguistic structure are assessed only in a single language group. In establishing a cross-linguistic comparative frame for the empirical portion of the present research , a procedure for isolating underlying cognitive influences on language structure will emerge , although it will not be fully developed.
Second , this study focuses on the cognitive significance ofthe diversity of linguistic structures across languages. It is not concerned with the importance of what might be termed Language, the general properties of the vocal-communicational behavioral skill and cognitive "faculty" pos­ sessed by virtually all members of the human species , for Thought, the generalized cognitive capacity we associate with adult members of the species. This latter issue has been of interest to physical anthropologists , biologists , and most psychologists , but it is not of immediate concern here except insofar as linguistic variability is itself a characteristic of human Language which warrants theoretical attention. The cognitive significance ascribed to the universal presence of Language in members of the species has been considerable , leading many to identify Language as the definitive element in a distinctively human cognition . This book will of necessity deal with the problem of the general role of Language in Thought in developing a hypothesis about the possible cognitive import­ ance of linguistic variation ; but the focus will be on the question of whether the particular formal organization of meaning characteristic of the speech of a group of persons influences the thought of the group in a discernible way . This particular question has been of most interest from a research standpoint to sociocultural anthropologists, to those interested in the comparative study of languages , and to a small subset of those who study psycholinguistics. There is at present little agreement about the

Introduction

7

influence of linguistic variety on thought or on the proper approach to studying the issue .
Third , this study focuses on the formal structuring of meaning in language. Thus, we will not be concerned at all with the phonological level, and only indirectly with the social uses of language. Differences among languages at the level of grammatical processes (i.e. , techniques of formal marking such as inflection) will be discussed in passing, but will not be the focus of the empirical research . The focus rather will be on differences in the grammatical structuring of meaning, that is, the ways syntactic and lexical categories interact to signal meaning in language­ specific ways.
Fourth , this study focuses on habitual thought, by which is meant everyday, routine ways of attending to objects and events, categorizing them , remembering them , and perhaps even reflecting upon them . The focus on habitual thought is meant to contrast with two more extreme alternatives. First, it contrasts with a focus on specialized thought, that is, cognitive routines or structures restricted to particular subgroups within a culture (e.g. , ritual or technical specialists) or restricted to particular domains in a culture (e.g. , kinship or illness) . Thus, for example, if certain specialists memorize vast amounts of information about a particular topic or have a highly differentiated classification scheme for a certain domain, it will be of secondary interest from the point of view of this work. These specialized practices will be overlooked here in order to facilitate cultural comparison - not because language effects are any less likely in these areas. Second, the focus on habitual thought contrasts with a concern for "potential" thought, that is, with what a given speaker or group of speakers could conceivably think like or think about in some circumstances. The notion of an abstract underlying thought potential will be avoided, as it is theoretically problematic and bears a very uncertain relationship to any actual behavior. In a sense , such potential thought is thought conceived of without any reference to actual contextual bounds . As such it lies at the opposite pole from specialized thought , which is contextually specific. Habitual thought , in the sense intended here , is intermediate in nature, being actually general across behavioral contexts within a culture.
Whether or not patterns of habitual thought can or should be summed up into an overall notion of worldview is a difficult problem which will be addressed only briefly in this study. For the purpose of this project , the critical question is whether there is or can be solid empirical evidence linking distinctive language patterns to distinctive habitual behavior or belief at the level of the aggregable individual social actors. In sub­ sequent work it may be possible to tackle more effectively the problems of specialized modes of speech and thought within a given culture and of

the role of language in promoting a degree of generality and integration in habitual everyday thought.

Overview of the research
The study consists of two parts, this book and a companion volume , Grammatical categories and cognition, that together present an historical, theoretical , and empirical re-examination of the linguistic relativity hypothesis , that is, the hypothesis that differences among languages in the grammatical structuring of meaning influence habitual thought .
This book presents an analytic review of the historical development of the hypothesis and previous attempts to provide empirical evidence directly relevant to it. The review is concerned with methodology in the broad sense , that is, with identifying the general requirements of adequate empirical work on this problem. The review analyzes in detail the flaws and the achievements of existing studies with the aim of formulating an improved approach to research . The companion volume Grammatical categories and cognition provides a concrete case study which utilizes this improved approach.
Chapter 1 details the historical context within which current formula­ tions developed. The focus is on the work of American anthropologists Franz Boas and Edward Sapir. Other research traditions, particularly those of nineteenth- and twentieth-century philosophy are not described, but the distinguishing characteristics of the American tradition are explained.
Chapter 2 examines in considerable detail the work of Benjamin Lee Whorf. In one way or another Whorf's work is the starting point for all contemporary research . Despite the significance of his work , it has often been greatly misunderstood . The goal in this chapter is to work through exactly what Whorf did say and, implicitly, to correct many of the prevalent misunderstandings.
Chapers 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 summarize subsequent empirical research by anthropological linguists and psycholinguists on the ideas of Sapir and Whorf. En route most of the important objections to Whorf's approach are described . Two other themes are stressed. First , empirical research in these two traditions strongly reflects both longstanding disciplinary perspectives and methods and the shifting tides of research concern over the years . Second , many of the concepts and methods that have been de'leloped complement each other in important ways and suggest the lines of a more adequate and comprehensive approach. The chapters come in pairs. Chapter 3 describes the traditional approach within anthropological linguistics, indicating its strengths and weaknesses ; and

Introduction

chapter 4 outlines more recent developments in this discipline which can solve some of the traditional problems. Chapter 5 discusses the dominant approach within psycholinguistics and its strengths and weaknesses; chapter 6 discusses a variety of minority approaches within this disci­ pline, some of which point the way towards remedying the weaknesses of the dominant tradition.
Chapter 7 distills this historical material and presents a theoretical reformulation which characterizes the issues in contemporary termin­ ology, identifies those elements or aspects which deserve prior attention , and indicates which existing research techniques can be effectively applied to the problem.
The companion volume Grammatical categories and cognition presents a new empirical investigation based on the theoretical reformu­ lation developed in chapter 7. The aim is to illustrate by means of a specific study the general approach being advocated and the sorts of results which can be expected. There is an emphasis throughout the second work on how the approach might be generalized. The substantive focus is on the influence of different nominal number marking patterns on attending, classifying, and remembering. The specific linguistic focus is developed by comparing American English with Yucatec Maya and looking for points of difference . Once a suitable linguistic contrast is found , specific cognitive hypotheses based on this linguistic focus are developed and then tested.
The introduction to Grammatical categories and cognition recapitu­ lates the main goals laid out in this book and outlines the structure of the case study presented there.
Chapter 1 describes in general terms the background of the com­ parative research in Yucatan, Mexico, outlining pertinent aspects of the culture and language as well as the general conduct of the field research .
Chapter 2 describes the linguistic differences between American English and Yucatec Maya in grammatical number marking. Each language is first described independently . The two descriptions are followed by a detailed contrast of the two languages framed within a broader comparative perspective . Formal syntactic number marking is shown to be more frequent and structurally significant in English than in Yucatec, and this difference is shown to relate intimately to the structure of lexical reference in the two languages .
Chapter 3 describes the cognitive assessment. On the basis of the linguistic analysis, general hypotheses are developed regarding probable cognitive consequences . Then specific hypotheses are explored in tasks involving attention , memory , and classification to verify more precisely the linguistic patterns and to assess how they correlate with behaviors

1. Development of the linguistic relativity hypothesis in America: Boas and Sapir
Although many scholars have concerned themselves with the questions of whether and how diverse languages influence thought , contemporary social science research centers on the claims of Benjamin Lee Whorf, a student of native American Indian languages. Whorf drew extensively upon the prior work of anthropologists Franz Boas and Edward Sapir in his formulation of the problem , so it will be useful to examine their contributions first .) The discussion will be relatively detailed, since an understanding of Whorf's position and an evaluation of his contribution depend on a comparison with these two predecessors .
Language as the reflection of culture: Boas
Franz Boas ( 1858-1942)2 was born and educated in Germany. He later emigrated to the United States, where he was the person primarily responsible for building anthropology into a professional discipline . He made contributions to most of the subfields of anthropology, including physical anthropology , social and cultural anthropology , and linguistic anthropology. His primary concerns were to break away from racial and evolutionary conceptions of culture by arguing on the one hand for the psychic unity of mankind and on the other hand for a notion of distinct cultures and culture areas, each to be studied on its own terms . In this chapter only his work on language will be discussed, although his broader agenda shapes his argument at several points.
The linguistic analysis of experience
Boas made three arguments about the nature of language that are impor­ tant for the eventual development of the view that language plays a role in shaping thought. First, he argued that languages classify experience :
11

Language diversity and thought

Since the total range of personal experience which language serves to express is

infinitely varied, and its whole scope must be expressed by a limited number of

phonetic groups, it is obvious that an extended classification of experiences must

underlie all articulate speech.

(Boas , 1966a ( 191 1 ] , p. 20)

Thus, each language of necessity contains intrinsic classifications which

group elements of experience as "alike" for the purposes of speech .3 In

this passage Boas is referring primarily to lexical items ,4 but it seems

clear from considered

the overall other sorts

doifscgursasmiomn a(t1i9c6a6l aca[t1e9g1o1r)i'esppto.

24-43) that he also be classificatory of

experience and , in some ways, more important.5

Second , different languages classify experience differently. Boas

emphasized that

the groups of ideas expressed by specific phonetic groups show very material

differences in different languages, and do not conform by any means to the same

principles of classification . (Boas , 1966a [ 191 1 ] , p. 21 , and 1916 [ 1 9 1 1 ] ' p. 145)

In various cultures these classifications may be founded on fundamentally distinct

principles.

(Boas, 1965 [ 1938] , p. 190)

the principles of classification which are found in different languages do not by

any means agree.

(Boas, 1916 [191 1], p. 198)

Thus it happens that each language , from the point of view of another language ,

may be arbitrary in its classifications; that what appears as a single simple idea in

one language may be characterized by a series of distinct phonetic groups in

another.

(Boas , 1966a [191 1 ] , p. 22 , and 1916 [191 1 ] , pp. 146-4-7)

Boas gave many examples ( 1966a [191 1 ) , sect. 2) to show the great variety among different languages . The majority of these examples consist of showing how a given experience would be differently rendered in various languages or how a set of experiences would be differently . grouped by different languages. His most famous example concerns the various words in Eskimo relating to snow:

Another example of the same kind , the words for SNOW in Eskimo, may be given.

Here we find one word , aput, expressing SNOW ON THE GROUND; another one ,

qana, FALLING SNOW; a third one , piqsirpoq, DRIFTING SNOW; and a fourth one ,

qimuqsuq, A SNOWDRIFT.

(1966a [191 1 ] , pp. 21-22)

Less familiar examples show the inverse relation with English having multiple words for what is a single modified form in another language :

As an example of the manner in which terms that we express by independent

words are grouped under one concept , the Dakota language may be selected.

The terms naxta'ka TO KICK, paxta'ka TO BIND IN BUNDLES, yaxta'ka TO BITE,

ic'a'xtaka TO BE N EAR TO, boxta'ka TO POUND, are all derived from the common

element xtaka TO GRIP, which holds them together, while we use distinct words for

expressing the various ideas.

(1966a [191 1 ] , p. 22)

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Boas, Sapir

13

In his concluding discussion of grammatical categories he made much the same point:

many of the categories which we are inclined to consider as essential may be absent in foreign languages, and . . . other categories may occur as substitutes.
(Boas , 1966a [1911] , p. 38)
When we consider for a moment what this implies, it will be recognized that in each language only . a part of the complete concept that we have in mind is expressed, and that each language has a peculiar tendency to select this or that aspect of the mental image which is conveyed by the expression of the thought.
(Boas, 1966a [1 911] , p. 39)

The additional examples that follow this passage make these differences clear by putting into overt surface forms some of the distinctions implicit in the grammatical categories of different languages.6 In general , in considering grammatical categories, Boas was concerned with obligatory categories ( 1 966a [ 1 9 1 1 ] , pp. 38-39 ; 1 965 [ 1 938] , pp . 193-94; 1966b [1917] , p. 207 ; see also Jakobson , 1 959) , but he also mentioned that optional categories may be another source of cross-language variation ( 1966a [191 1 ] , p. 39) .
Third , linguistic phenomena are unconscious in character, apparently because of their highly automatic production .7 Boas observed:

It would seem that the essential difference between linguistic phenomena and other ethnological phenomena is, that the linguistic classifications never rise into consciousness, while in other ethnological phenomena, although the same unconscious origin prevails, these often rise into consciousness, and thus give rise to secondary reasoning and to re-interpretations. (Boas, 1966a [191 1 ] , p. 63)8

the infinitely large number of ideas have been reduced by classification to a lesser

number, which by constant use have established firm associations, and which can

be used automatically.

(Boas, 1916 [191 1 ] , p. 145)

the use of language is so automatic that the opportunity never arises for the
fundamental notions to emerge into consciousness. (Boas, 1966a [1911] , p. 64)

Thus, while an extensive classification of experience is implicit in language , speakers individually and collectively typically remain unaware of it because of its highly automatic nature .9

The relation of languages to thought and culture
Boas's essential view was that linguistic classifications reflect but do not dictate thought, that is, the conceptual ideas and forms of thinking characteristic of a culture . Boas was rarely systematic or explicit in presenting his ideas on the relation of language and thought , but his most

14

Language diversity and thought

general attitude seems to have been that language categories directly reflect (or express) ideas and hence linguistic data can be used to study those ideas . 10 So , on the one hand , variations among languages reflect the divergent historical experience of the group and, on the other hand, universals across languages reflect the psychic unity of man:

it seems well worth while . . . to seek in the peculiarities of the groupings of ideas in different languages an important characteristic in the history of the mental development of the various branches of mankind. From this point of view, the occurrence of the most fundamental grammatical concepts in all languages must be considered as proof of the unity of fundamental psychological processes.
(Boas, 1966a [191 1 ] , p. 67)

This view flows quite naturally from Boas's general argument that individual performance and ability are much the same in every culture , but that individuals are enmeshed in different traditions ; apparent differences in thought arise from the amalgamation of new perceptions and ideas to different traditional bodies of knowledge (1916 [191 1], pp. 197-243, especially p. 203; see also Stocking's, 1974, discussion of this point).
Occasionally , Boas spoke more directly to the interrelation of lan­ guage and thought, but within the context of a general debate about higher levels of thought as distinctive of civilized man . He felt that the presence of some linguistic devices in a society such as a lexical item corresponding to an abstract concept might facilitate abstract thought, but he felt this was a relatively minor matter with respect to cross­ language comparison , and he concluded :

It seems very questionable in how far the restriction of the use of certain

grammatical forms can really be conceived as a hindrance in the formulation of

generalized ideas. It seems much more likely that the lack of these forms is due to

the lack of their need.

(Boas, 1966a [ 1 9 1 1 ] , p. 60)

Thus it would seem that the obstacles to generalized thought inherent in the form

of a language are of minor importance only, and that presumably the language

alone would not prevent a people from advancing to more generalized forms of

thinking if the general state of their culture should require expression of such

thought.

(Boas, 1966a [191 1 ] , p. 63 ; also 1965 (1938] , pp. 195-98) 1 1

O n the other hand , he argued that language form can also b e a source of error in thought, but again this was not unique to any particular language :

When we try to think at all clearly, we think, on the whole , in words; and it is well known that, even in the advancement of science , inaccuracy of vocabulary has often been a stumbling-block which has made it difficult to reach accurate conclusions. The same words may be used with different significance , and by assuming the word to have the same significance always, erroneous conclusions

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Boas, Sapir

15

may be reached. It may also be that the word expresses only part of an idea, so that owing to its use the full range of the subject-matter discussed may not be recognized. In the same manner the words may be too wide in their significance , including a number of distinct ideas the differences of which in the course of the development of the language were not recognized.
(Boas, 1966a [ 191 1 ] ' pp. 67-68)
But
All these traits of human thought, which are known to influence the history of science and which play a more or less important role in the general history of civilization, occur with equal frequency in the thoughts of primitive man .
(Boas, 1966a ( 191 1 ] , p. 68)

In short , language categories may facilitate or confuse thought in various ways, but there is no basis for ascribing intrinsic privilege to any one language (or group of speakers) over another in this regard .
While Boas did not put these arguments together to make an argument regarding language-specific influences on thought , such a view does emerge in his later writings in at least one passage :

The general concepts underlying language are entirely unknown to most people. They do not rise into consciousness until the scientific study of grammar begins. Nevertheless, the categories of language compel us to see the world arranged in certain definite conceptual groups which , on account of our lack of knowledge of linguistic processes, are taken as objective categories and which, therefore , impose themselves upon the form of our thoughts . (Boas, 1966c (1920] , p. 289)

Everything is present for an argument of linguistic relativity based on taking our linguisticcategories as objective reality except for an emphasis on the diversity of these conceptual groups. It is not until the end of his life , perhaps under the influence of Sapir and Whorf, that the possible influence of linguistic diversity was integrated with these views , and Boas remained highly cautious in his formulation :

It is another question in how far the categories of grammar and the general classification of experience may control thought . . . The obligatory categories of language differ fundamentally . . . It is obvious that the mental picture aroused by a spoken sentence will be fundamentally different according to these categories . . . The form of our grammar compels us to select a few traits of thought we wish to express and suppresses many other aspects which the speaker has in mind and which the hearer supplies according to his fancy . . .

There is little doubt that thought is thus directed in various channels. . . . Such a

tendency pervading the language may well lead to a different reaction to the

incidents of everyday life and it is conceivable that in this sense the mental

activities of a people may be in part directed by language . I should not be inclined

to overestimate this influence because devices for expressing . . . [various ideas]

are ever-present , and may rise into idiomatic use . In this sense , we may say that

language exerts a limited influence on culture .

(Boas, 1942 , pp. 18 1-83)

16

Language diversity and thought

In the end , it seems that Boas's two desires , to assert the psychic unity of man and to avoid premature generalization at the theoretical level, kept him from going further along this line of thought to the claim of significant differences in thought among different linguistic-cultural groups. Nonetheless, most of the elements necessary for such an argu­ ment are already present in his work.
Concerning the broader related topic of the connection of language and culture , Boas felt that language and culture could covary freely (see , e . g . , his discussion of the independence of race , language , and culture in Boas , 1 966a [ 1 9 1 1 ] , pp. 1-10) . However, if there were influences, they were those of culture on language, and not vice versa :

It does not seem likely, therefore , that there is any direct relation between the culture of a tribe and the language they speak , except in so far as the form of the language will be moulded by the state of culture , but not in so far as a certain state of culture is conditioned by morphological traits of the language.
(Boas , 1966a [191 1 ] , p. 63)

(See also 1942 , pp. 178-83. ) However, in his examples of how elements of language can affect our thinking, he repeatedly showed how linguistic patterns may influence custom . So various extensions of kinship terms lead to historical changes in actual kin categories ; a failure to distinguish a name from the personality named is connected to naming children after ancestors; and metaphoric descriptions of social events and personae are interpreted literally in the historical development of ritual and myth (Boas, 1966a [ 1 9 1 1 ] , pp. 68-69) . Thus, as indicated in the passages quoted earlier, language can influence culture via its influence on thought. In each of these cases, however, it is the lexical level of language which is implicated , and we can conclude conservatively that Boas was open to the mutual interaction of vocabulary with culture in general , though for various reasons he did not develop a detailed argument . 12

Summary
So Boas emphasized that every language represents a classification of experience , these classifications vary dramatically from language to language , and they are so automatic that they typically lie outside the sphere of conscious awareness. Boas tended to see language reflecting elementary psychological functioning (hence its universal character) and specific historical experience (hence its variable character) . He tended to reject the claims for a general effect of language on culture , seeing them as in free variation, but he did note that language can be an aid in abstraction and a source of error. Quite late in his life he voiced ,

17

somewhat tentatively, the possibility of a shaping role for language in thought and culture .

Language and the relativity of the form of thought: Sapir
Edward Sapir (1884-1939) was Boas's premier student in the area of linguistic studies. He is known for both the quality and the quantity of his empirical research on specific languages and also for the breadth and clarity of his theoretical vision. He also played an important role in developing the subfield of culture and personality, which is concerned with the interaction between psychological functioning and cultural patterns. His concern for the relationship between language and thought stands at the intersection of these two areas of interest .

The linguistic analysis of experience
Sapir elaborated on Boas's arguments in a number of ways, the most important of which was his emphasis on the formal completeness of each language as a symbolic system:
The outstanding fact about any language is its formal completeness . . . To put this . . . in somewhat different words, we may say that a language is so constructed that no matter what any speaker of it may desire to communicate . . . the language is prepared to do his work . . . The world of linguistic forms, held within the framework of a given language , is a complete system of reference . . .
(Sapir, 1949c [1924] ' p. 153)
(See also Sapir, 194ge [1921], p. 98; 1949j [1927] , pp . 550-53 ; and 1964 [ 193 1], p. 128. ) Because each language constitutes a complete system of reference , any specific formal or substantive element of language must be seen as a component of such a system. 13
Sapir echoed Boas's ideas about implicit classification of experience in language in much the same terms, but he also emphasized the social function of these shared formal classifications :
the single experience lodges in an individual consciousness and is, strictly speaking, incommunicable . To be communicated it needs to be referred to a class which is tacitly accepted by the community as an identity.
( 1 94ge [192 1 ] , pp . 12-13)
And since language categories are interrelated in a coherent system of forms , so too , by extension , are the various individual experiences they. represent . These language forms serve to

18

Language diversity and thought

establish a definite relational feeling or attitude towards all possible contents of expression and , through them , towards all possible contents of experience , in so far, of course , as experience is capable of expression in linguistic terms.
(Sapir, 1949c [1924] . p. 153)

(See also Sapir 1949h [ 1 929] , p. 166 . ) Under this interpretation , experi­

ence is considerably more ordered by language than it would be with a

simple unorganized assortment of classifications. 14 This emphasis on the

formal , systematic aspect of language represents a crucial development

in Sapir's argument.

Second , like Boas, Sapir emphasized the formal diversity of languages

(see especially noting that the

but was

again he itself one

went further, source of this

diversity:

Inasmuch as languages differ very widely in their systematization of fundamental concepts, they tend to be only loosely equivalent to each other as symbolic devices and are , as a matter of fact , incommensurable in the sense in which two systems of points in a plane are , on the whole , incommensurable to each other if they are plotted out with reference to differing systems of coordinates.
(Sapir. 1964 [193 1 ] . p. 128)

So he added to Boas's views regarding the differences among the

categories of various languages the notion that these categories are

arranged into formally complete yet incommensurate systems .

Sapir's evidence for variety among languages, like that of Boas ,

consists essentially of detailed comparisons of the different ways in which

the same experience would be differentially encoded by an expression in

each of two languages. The most extended and useful examples are given

as part of his discussion of grammatical concepts in his book Language

( 1 94ge .cation

5),I5 kinds

where he also develops of concepts expressed in

a preliminary c1assifi­ languages. His central

example examines the English sentence the farmer kills the duckling. He

shows that this simple five-word sentence entails thirteen distinct con­

cepts . He then contrasts this English sentence with others from German ,

Yana , Chinese , Kwakiutl , and so forth, showing that many of these

concepts need not be expressed, but that others must be expressed in

their stead.

Third , in addition to repeating Boas's arguments regarding the

unconscious, automatic nature of language (Sapir, 1949f [1912] .

pp . 100--1 ; noted that

1949c [ 1 924] . pp . 155-56; 1949j the systematic formal aspect of

548-49) , Sapir another factor

which helps account for the unconscious nature of linguistic phenomena .

On the one hand

the reasoning intelligence seeks to attach itself rather to the functions than to the

forms of conduct.

(Sapir, 1949j [1927] . p. 547)

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Boas, Sapir

19

Hence the formal aspect of cultural and linguistic patterns tends to be overlooked easily. On the other hand, the complexity of formal relations and the unified nature of the whole add to the impenetrability of linguistic forms - especially when each is examined in isolation. Sapir first made this point in a general way about all cultural patterns:

Why are the forms of social behavior not adequately known by the normal individual? . . . I believe that the answer to this question rests in the fact that the relations between elements of experience which serve to give them their form and significance are more powerfully "felt" or "intuited" 16 than consciously per­ ceived. It is a matter of common knowledge that it is relatively easy to fix the attention on some arbitrarily selected element of experience , such as a sensation or an emotion, but that it is far from easy to become conscious of the exact place which such an element holds in the total constellations of behavior.
( 1949j [1927] , p. 548) 17

This is followed by extensive exemplification from linguistics, with the conclusion that

In the simple facts of language we have an excellent example of an important

network of patterns of behavior, each of them with exceedingly complex and, to a

large extent , only vaguely definable functions, which is preserved and trans­

mitted with minimum consciousness.

(1949j [1927] , p. 555)

Thus , the systematic formal nature of linguistic (and other cultural) phenomena makes them particularly resistant to folk analysis. Although both of these arguments - natural focus on function over form and difficulty in comprehending the role of a particular form in a complex network of forms - probably play a role in the unconscious nature of linguistic phenomena, they are not distinctive, in Sapir's view, of linguistic as opposed to other aspects of culture. In this sense his observations did not advance the argument for the special nature of language even as far as the position advocated by Boas, although he did identify additional factors accounting for the lack of awareness of all cultural forms.

The relation of languages to thought and culture
Sapir, led in part by these observations, essentially reversed Boas's claim that linguistic classifications reflect thought and argued rather that organized linguistic classifications channel thought . His argument had two parts.
First , he saw thought as arising from an interpretation of, or reading into , language classifications of their full conceptual potential:
From the point of view of language , thought may be defined as the highest latent or potential content of speech, the content that is obtained by interpreting each

20

Language diversity and thought

of the elements in the flow of language as possessed of its very fullest conceptual

value

. . . It is, indeed, in the highest degree likely that language is an instrument

originally put to uses lower than the conceptual plane and that thought arises as a

refined interpretation of its content.

( 1 94ge [ 1 92 1 ] , pp. 14-15) 18

Note here that Sapir holds this to be true quite aside from arguments

about linguistic variation.

Sapir did not thereby equate language and thought - in fact he

explicitly claimed the opposite ( 1 94ge [ 1 92 1 ] , p. 15) - but argued rather

that whether or not thought is a natural domain apart from speech , it is

nonetheless only through language (i . e . , some particular , socially con­

ventional symbolism) that we are led to fully conceptual thought. He

dismissed the intuition we have of being able to think without language as

due either to a confusion of imagery with thought or to the confusion of

the pp .

auditory aspect 15-16) . Finally

of language with its formal he acknowledged that the

structure (194ge development of

[s1p9e2e1c)h'

itself was probably dependent in a high degree on the development of

thought :

The instrument makes possible the product , the product refines the instrument. (Sapir. 194ge [1921]. p. 17)

Secondly, this process of reading into linguistic categories interacts with the formally complete nature of language to yield , in fact, a systematic (re)constitution of reality:

Language is . . . a self-contained, creative symbolic organization, which not only

refers to experience largely acquired without its help but actually defines

experience for us by reason of its formal completeness and because of our

unconscious projection of its implicit expectations into the field of experience . . .

[Language] categories . . . are , of course , derivative of experience at last analysis,

but, once abstracted from experience , they are systematically elaborated in

language and are not so much discovered in experience as imposed upon it

because of the tyrannical hold that linguistic form has upon our orientation in the

world .

(Sapir, 1964 [ 193 1 ] . p. 128)

(See also Sapir 1949d [ 1 933) , p. 10.) In short , Sapir claims we anticipate (or read) experience in terms of language categories which , by virtue of their abstraction and elaboration in the linguistic process, no longer correspond to experience in a direct way.
It only remained to add to this the argument that these categories are only loosely equivalent to derive the conclusion that particular languages channel thought (i . e . , conceptual interpretations of reality) in diverse ways :

It would be possible to go on indefinitely with such examples of incommensurable analyses of experience in different languages. The upshot of it all would be to make very real to us a kind of relativity that is generally hidden from us by our

naive acceptance o f fixed habits o f speech a s guides t o a n objective understanding

of the nature of experience. This is the relativity of concepts or, as it might be

called , the relativity of the form of thought.

(1949c [1924] , p. 159)

(See also Sapir, 1949c [ 1 924] , p. 153; Sapir and Swadesh, 1964 [ 1 92946] , p. 103.)
I t i s worth highlighting that this "relativity of thought" i s o f "concepts" or of "the form of thought . " Thus there are diverse conceptual interpre­ tations19 of experience based upon a naive reliance upon our linguistic classifications as a guide to obj ective reality when in fact many possible linguistic classifications , and hence conceptualizations, are possible . Sapir intends here to encompass more than ordinary everyday thought. He remarks , "no matter how sophisticated our modes of interpretation become , we never really get beyond the projection and continuous transfer of relations suggested by the forms of our speech" (1949d [1933] , p. 1 1 ) . Thus conceived , the relativity of thought does not jeopardize the Boasian principles of the psychic unity of man , because it operates at the level of conceptual interpretations of reality and not at the level of basic psychological processes or functions . However, this view requires that we look "through" the peculiarities of linguistic forms, and the rational­ izations and extensions built upon them, to discover the nature of this underlying psychological unity:

All forms of linguistic expression are reducible to a common psychological ground, but this ground cannot be properly understood without the perspective gained from a sympathetic study of the forms themselves.
(Sapir and Swadesh , 1964 [ 1929-46] , p. 101)

In other words the common psychological ground of language can only be gotten at by working through the diversity of manifest forms of languages . 2o
Regarding the connection between language and culture more gen­ erally, Sapir shared Boas's views that culture influenced language (and not vice versa) and that this influence was chiefly evident in the vocabulary and not in the morphological ,21 or formal , part of language , which Sapir regarded as especially self-contained (for example , Sapir, 1949f [1912) , pp. 90-100 ; 1949i [ 1 916) , p. 432 ; 194ge [ 1 92 1 ) , pp . 218-19; 1949h [ 1 929] , pp. 164-65 ; 1949d [ 1 933] , pp. 26-27 ; 1947 , p. 3 ; etc . ) .
I n his early writings o n this topic, Sapir argued that a connection between language and culture might be deducible through the inter­ vening variable of thought modes, but he concluded that the evidence was essentially negative :

Linguistic morphology , on the other hand , as giving evidence of certain definite modes of thought prevalent among the speakers of the language , may be thought to stand in some sort of relation to the stock of concepts forming the mental stock

22

Language diversity and thought .

in trade , as it were , of the group. As this stock of concepts, however, is

necessarily determined by the physical and social environment, it follows that

some sort of correlation between these environments and grammatical structure

might be looked for. And yet the negative evidence is as strong in this case as in

the parallel [phonetic22] one just disposed of.

(Sapir, 1949f [1912] , p. 97)

This contradiction between analysis and evidence may be the basis for a discussion some years later in which Sapir divided thought into a content (or cultural) aspect and a formal/processual (or linguistic) aspect which, he argued, need not be causally linked:

Nor can I believe that culture and language are in any true sense causally related.

Culture may be defined as what a society does and thinks. Language is a

particular how of thought. It is difficult to see what particular causal relations

may be expected to subsist between a selected inventory of experience (culture , a

significant selection made by society) and the particular manner in which the

society expresses all experience .

(Sapir, 194ge [192 1 ] , p. 218)

Thus, by splitting thought into two natures (a "what" and a "how") Sapir could retain the relation of thought to both culture and language without the difficulty (or contradiction) implied by a lack of connection in turn between language and culture. Sapir did mention that if it could be shown that "culture has an innate form ," then it might once more become interesting to contrast language with culture .23
Exceptions to the generalization that Sapir did not argue for a reverse influence , that is, for language having an influence on culture , include the following oft-quoted lines:

Language is a guide to 'social reality' . . . Human beings do not live in the

objective world alone , nor alone in the world of social activity as ordinarily

understood, but are very much at the mercy of the particular language which has

become the medium of expression for their society . . . the 'real world' is to a large

extent unconsciously built up on the language habits of the group. No two

languages are ever sufficiently similar to be considered as representing the same

social reality. The worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds , not

merely the same world with different labels attached .

. . . We see and hear and otherwise experience very largely as we do because

the language habits of our community predispose certain choices of interpre­

tation . . . From this standpoint we may think of language as the symbolic guide to

culture.

(Sapir, 1949h [1929] , p. 162)24

These comments follow by only two years Sapir's paper "The unconscious patterning of behavior in society" (1949j [1927]). in which he draws stronger conclusions than earlier about the organization or formal patterning of cultural phenomena and of the general similarity of such phenomena to linguistic patterning. These remarks may reflect a change in belief by Sapir, namely that the notion of "form" in culture was now a viable concept.25

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Boas, Sapir 23

Indeed, two years later Sapir reaches much the same conclusion and appears to be moving toward a conception of culture based more on shared symbolic understandings:

it is obvious that language has the power to analyze experience into theoretically

dissociable elements and to create that world of the potential intergrading with

the actual which enables human beings to transcend the immediately given in

their individual experiences and to join in a larger common understanding. This

common understanding constitutes culture , which cannot be adequately defined

by a description of those more colorful patterns of behavior in society which lie

open to observation .

(Sapir, 1949d [ 1933] , p. 10)

However, another clear comment on this topic published posthumously (Sapir, 1947) seems to indicate a consistency with earlier views, in that there is hesitancy once more regarding the relation of the formal aspects of language to culture:

If . . . there are fundamental relations between cultural and formal linguistic

phenomena, they cannot be of the type which so many linguistic philosophers and

social scientists are in the habit of discovering.

(Sapir, 1947, p. 3)

We may interpret this as a disavowal of evolutionary or specific culture trait connections of the type rejected by Boas before (and Whorf after) , but not of any connections whatsoever, if properly conceptualized .

Summary
Sapir worked out the implications of the fact that the implicit classifi­ cations of experience in language (described by Boas) cohere into formally complete systems. Thus , the differences among languages lie not merely in the content of the individual classifications themselves , but , among other things , in their systematic formal arrangement . The formal , systemic nature of these classifications is one factor contributing to their remaining out-of-awareness. Whereas Boas saw language as primarily reflecting thought and culture and only on occasion having a direct influence back on them, Sapir began to see in language a powerful shaping factor because of the impact of using this creative symbolic tool in the interpretation of experience . He argued that the use of this tool transforms and , in part , constitutes conceptual thought ; the naive acceptance of language-specific properties as guides to reality channels and shapes the speakers' view of physical and social reality. While Sapir recognized the logical plausibility of the influence of language on culture via its influence on thought , he felt the evidence on this issue was negative. However, in his later writings certain reconceptualizations of thought and culture emerged which pointed toward a notion of culture

24 Language diversity and thought .
involving shared symbolic understandings, which of necessity depend largely on a linguistic base .
Conclusion
Boas and Sapir lay the groundwork for a notion of linguistic relativity by showing that each language represents a classification of experience which can vary considerably. However, they differ in their sense as to the importance of this variation for thought and culture. Boas believed that the influences on thought and culture were minimal and , if anything, that stronger influences ran in the other direction . Sapir felt (particularly in the later period) that there was an influence on thought, although he did not investigate this in detail, but he felt that the linkage to culture was questionable given the available evidence.

2 . Development of the linguistic relativity hypothesis in America: Whorf
Introduction
Benj amin Lee Whorf (1897-194 1 ) was trained as a chemical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and worked as a fire­ prevention engineer for the Hartford Insurance Company for his entire professional career. Avocationally , however, he pursued a wide variety of interests, centering for the most part on a deep concern for the apparent conflict between science and religion . This general interest eventually became focused on linguistic problems , and it is in the area of language-related studies that he made his most important scholarly contributions. (Biographical accounts of Whorf's life and his interests can be found in Carroll , 1956, and Rollins , 1972 and 1980. Whorf, 1956a , 1 also contains a bibliography of most of Whorf's published and unpublished works.)
Whorf was initially self-taught i n linguistics , but later (after 193 1 ) benefited significantly from interaction with Sapir and his circle of students at nearby Yale . His interest in and formulation of the specifi­ cally linguistic relativity principle probably stemmed in large part from this contact with Sapir. It is important to realize that despite his "amateur" status , Whorf's work in linguistics was and still is recognized as being of superb professional quality by linguists . He produced general descriptive works on the modern Nahuatl (Aztec) and Hopi languages, partial descriptive studies of a variety of other languages contemporary and ancient , historical reconstructions of the Uto-Aztecan and adj acent language families , epigraphic studies of Mayan and central Mexican hieroglyphic writings , and a number of theoretical articles . Most of these works are still of contemporary relevance .

The linguistic analysis of experience

Language classifies experience

Whorf shared with Boas and Sapir the view that language was classifica­ tory , isolating and organizing elements of experience (Whorf, 1956a , pp. 55 , 102, 162, 210-13 , 240) . And, like Sapir, he emphasized the productive formal completeness of the linguistic system of classifications and the dependency of meaning on the patterns of relations among classifications ( 1 956a , pp. 58-59, 67, 102 , 156) . Further, he agreed with Sapir that the analysis of experience implicit in a language might only be in accord with obj ective experience up to a point ; thereafter, the role of the socially conventional linguistic scheme itself becomes important in further defining the nature of what is classified and in what way ( 1 956a,
pp . 92 , 102, 212-13). However, Whorf went much further than Sapir by examining less obvious morphological categories to reveal the full classificatory nature of language and hence the true extent of the possible interactions of language classifications with thought . 2
Whorf went beyond Boas and Sapir to distinguish two types of classification implicit in language : overt categories and covert categories . 3 Overt and covert categories differ from each other in their degree of systematic formal marking:

An overt category is a category having a formal mark which is present (with only infrequent exceptions) in every sentence containing a member of the category . The mark need not be part of the same word to which the category may be said to be attached in a paradigmatic sense ; i . e . it need not be a suffix , prefix , vowel change . or other "inflection , " but may be a detached word or a certain patterning of the whole sentence. Thus in English the plural of nouns is an overt category, marked usually in the paradigm word (the noun in question) by the suffix 'os' or a vowel change , but in the case of words like 'fish , sheep,' and certain gentilic plurals, it is marked by the form of the verb , the manner of use of the articles, etc. . . .

A covert category is marked, whether morphemically or by sentence-pattern ,

only in certain types of sentence and not in every sentence in which a word or

element bebnging to the category occurs . The class-membership of the word is

not apparent until there is a question of using it or referring to it in one of these

special types of sentence , and then we find that this word belongs to a class

requiring some sort of distinctive treatment , which may even be the negative

treatment of excluding that type of sentence . This distinctive treatment we may

call the REACTANCE of the category. In English . intransitive verbs form a covert

category marked by lack of the passive participle and the passive and causative

voices; we cannot substitute a verb of this class (e .g. 'go, lie . sit . rise, gleam ,

sleep. arrive , appear. rej oice') into such sentences as 'It was cooked, It was

being cooked , I had it cooked to order. '

(1956a, pp. 88-89)4

The linguistic reLativity hypothesis: Whorl 27

It should be stressed that covert categories are marked in the language , but their marking emerges only in certain contexts of use . 5 Whorf noted:
Grammatical classes are not to be set up on the absence of any markers at all ; from a grammatical configurative standpoint an entirely unmarked class would be a fiction . . . Covert marking is very definitely marking. (1956b [1938] , p. 5)

Whorf pointed out that such marking (whether covert or overt) some­ times might not occur in the immediate sentence but rather in a "small group of sentences (immediate field of discourse)" ( 1 956b [1938] , p. 5 ) .
Whorf occasionally applied an alternative set of labels to covert and overt categories , namely cryptotype and phenotype, respectively. He used the term cryptotype initially (in 1936 and 1937) to highlight those covert categories that have subtle meaning and no overt marks other than their impact on the structural possibilities of various overtly marked fo rms :

A covert linguistic class . . . may have a very subtle meaning, and it may have no

overt mark other than certain distinctive "reactances" with certain overtly

marked forms. It is then what I call a CRYPTOTYPE .

(1956a , p. 70)

He later shifted to using the less stringent criterion of relatively infrequent reactances while retaining essentially the same definition :

A covert category may also be termed a CRYPTOTYPE, a name which calls attention

to the rather hidden, cryptic nature of such word-groups, especially when they

are not strongly contrasted in idea, nor marked by frequently occurring reac­

tances such as pronouns.

( 1 956a , p. 92)

(See also Whorf, 1956a, pp. 8�83 , 105 . ) The term cryptotype, then, had two senses, one referring to a relative lack of marking and the other referring to relative obscurity of meaning. The discussion of phenotypes follows the same pattern, beginning with the use of the term to empha­ size the conjunction of clear meaning and very regular marking:

I give the name PHENOTYPE to the linguistic category with a clearly apparent class

meaning and a formal mark or morpheme which accompanies it; i . e . , the

phenotype is the "classical" nlorphological category.

(1956a, p. 72)

This later shifted slightly, as with the case above , to a greater focus on the degree of formal marking, essentially permitting the use of the term for the mark :

The contrasting term PHENOTYPE may be applied to the overt category and, when

no ambiguity results, to the mark which accompanies the overt category in the

sentence .

( 1 956a , p. 93)

Whorf then used these terms rather freely as alternates to the terms covert and overt .
Whorf's use of these alternate terms can be confusing. He sometimes

28

Language diversity and thought

spoke as if they were fully equivalent with the terms overt and covert, yet in other places they are clearly used to refer to subsets of the broader terms. (Contrast, for example, the pairs of citations in the previous paragraph . ) Further, by referring sometimes to the relative clarity of meaning and sometimes to the relative ubiquity of marking with the same term , he invited further confusion. In a later writing on the subject of overt and covert categories (in 1938) , Whorf moved toward using phenotype and cryptotype more exclusively for meaning as opposed to marking, but in a way that was inconsistent with his earlier uses:

Grammatical classes which appear ordinarily "without" markers do have

markers appearing with them under certain particular circumstances - such a

class is "covert", and its marker a "reactance". Its grammatical meaning, if

distinguishable , is a "cryptotype" . . . Overt categories are accompanied by

markers in all or nearly all sentences . . . Their grammatical meanings are

"phenotypes" .

(1956b [19381 , p. 5)

Thus, phenotype and cryptotype refer to the grammatical meanings6 of overt and covert categories respectively. This usage has the advantage of permitting unambiguous reference to the meaning of a category indepen­ dently of its marking. (There are some earlier hints of movement in this direction, e.g. , in Whorf, 1956a, pp. 105 and 109 , but nothing this definite . ) In the following discussion , Whorf's last usage will be fol­ lowed . 7
It should b e emphasized that only t h e degree of formal marking makes a category overt or covert. The substantive content of the category is generally not at issue . Whorf pointed out that a given classification may be overt in one language and covert in another; he gave examples which include the gender classes of various European languages and the shape classes of various American Indian languages (1956a , pp. 90--9 1 ; see also pp. 69-70) . Although Whorf occasionally used the term cryptotype to imply that the meaning of a covert category is subtle or elusive, this was not the basis of its classification as a covert category.
However, by contrast , the relative covertness of a category does appear to affect its meaning, or content . For example, as we have seen , Whorf implied by his use of the term cryptotype that many covert categories do have subtle, elusive meanings that are not readily brought into consciousness at least in part because of their covert status (1956a, pp . 70--7 1 , 83 , 92, 104-5 , 132) . Further, he argued that such categories were more likely to be "rational ," by which he meant in accordance with his view of nonlinguistic fact and not merely a cultural or linguistic convention. This happens because the category, in the absence of many formal marks, is free to crystallize around an idea:

Indeed, covert categories are quite apt to be more rational than overt ones. English unmarked [i. e . , covert] gender is more rational, closer to natural fact ,

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Whorf 29

than the marked [i .e. , overt] genders of Latin or German . As outward marks

become few, the class tends to crystallize around an idea - to become more

dependent on whatever synthetizing principle there may be in the meanings of its

members .

(1956a , p. 80)

Overt categories, then, are more likely to be at variance with classifi­ cations that might be made on purely rational grounds (in Whorf's sense of the term). (This is more often implied than directly stated by Whorf, 1956a , pp. 69 , 80-81 , 91 , 109, 261-62 . ) To say that covert categories are more rational, however, does not mean that they are completely so:

Likewise with various covert categories of exotic languages : where they have

been thought to be recognitions of objective differences , it may rather be that

they are grammatical categories that merely accord up to a certain point with

objective experience . They may represent experience , it is true , but experience

seen in terms of a definite linguistic scheme .

(1956a , p. 92)

Thus, for example , even though he has suggested that English gender is more rational than Latin or German gender (1956a, p. 80) , he explains in considerable detail how a good part of the English gender system is not deducible from "a knowledge of actual sex and of scientific biological and physical classification of objects" ( 1 956a, p. 90) , but rather depends to a considerable extent on linguistic and cultural conventions, some of which he describes (1956a, pp . 90-92) .
Overt and covert categories do not operate independently of one another. Both need analysis to provide a full understanding of the category meanings of a language :
The meaning of a PHENOTYPE , though ostensibly plain , can really not be understood in all its subtlety until the cryptotypes that go with it have been dredged up from their submerged state and their effective meanings to some extent brought into consciousness. Thereupon the different effects produced by the same phenotype with different cryptotypes, and vice versa, result in a more pronounced consciousness and clearer understanding of the phenotype itself.
(1956a , p. 109 ; see also pp. 105 and 1 10)

One aspect of this interdependence that particularly interested Whorf was the possibility that languages might use covert categories to different degrees - and, in particular, that a language that was overtly very simple might in fact be more complex in its covert categories:

It may turn out that the simpler a language becomes overtly, the more it becomes

dependent upon cryptotypes and other covert formations, the more it conceals

unconscious presuppositions, and the more its lexations become variable and

indefinable .

(1956a, p. 83)

Whorf pointed out that Hopi and English were particularly rich in covert categories and that this might not be true of all languages ( 1 956a, pp. 82,

30

Language diversity and thought

1 10) , but he appeared to believe in the general utility of the overt-covert distinction since he included it in his general theoretical discussions without such warning ( 1 956a , pp . 88-93 , 129, 132) . Certainly, throughout his work he stressed the importance of hierarchical levels of patterning as contributing to meaning and the inadequacy of analyzing a linguistic element (e . g . , a lexeme) in isolation from its associated patterns . (See , for example , the early remarks in 1936 [1956a , pp. 67-69] and the later remarks in 1 941 [ 1 956a , pp . 246-70] .8)
Much as Sapir's insight that the classifications in language form a self-contained, formally complete symbolic universe led to his more sophisticated understanding of the mechanism and potential significance of language influences on thought , so too did Whorf's conceptualization of covert categories lead to a still more sophisticated theory on these issues. Where Sapir had to make generalized, somewhat vague refer­ ences to form-feeling, intuition , or relational feeling arising from the overall patterns of relations in a language , Whorf was able to discuss specific , empirically investigable covert linkages among the forms in a language :
A covert concept like a covert gender is as definable and in its way as definite as a verbal concept like 'female' or feminine, but is of a very different kind ; it is not the analogue of a word but of a rapport-system, and awareness of it has an intuitive quality ; we say that it is sensed rather than comprehended.
( 1956a, pp. 69-70)

The concepts involved might be intuitive for the speakers of a language , but they could become explicit and well defined for the analyst , as Whorf demonstrated repeatedly through his illustrative analyses (see , for example , 1956a , pp. 68-70, 90-9 1 , 102-1 1 ) . It is crucial to Whorf's subsequent arguments that the cognitive influences he traces to gram­ matical regularities need not derive solely from the most obvious and systematic overt categories in a language , but may involve large numbers of underlying covert linkages which work together as a unified psychic complex :

There is no evident reason why such a [psychicJ complex [of covert linkagesJ

should not enter into various functional relations with other material of thought

without necessarily requiring the activation of any of the individual words or class

marks with which it is connected.

( 1 956a, p. 69)

The covert classes may have a far-reaching connection with the type of thinking,

the "philosophy" or "implicit metaphysics" of a [languageJ . . . The manifes­

tations of these class-distinctions in thinking and the character of the sometimes

rather deeply-hidden and seldom-appearing reactances suggest the phenomena

associated with the unconscious, subconscious, or foreconscious in psychology,

though on a more socialized and less purely personal plane , and may connect in a

significant manner therewith .

( 1 956b [ 1938J, p. 5)

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Whorf 3 1
(See also Whorf, 1956a , p. 81 . ) Thus the influence o f language on thought need not arise only through the influence of the more straight­ forward , easily described morphological categories, but may also arise from covert categories in the language . Further, because cryptotypes can play such an important role in defining phenotypes , a simple , naive analysis of overt morphology is not a sure guide either to the meanings of those elements or to their significance in cognition . Thus, in Whorf's view, overt morphology is doubly unreliable: it neither accurately reflects the "objective" nonlinguistic reality (in line with the arguments of Sapir) nor adequately represents the full linguistic reality . Although Whorf did not cast his later, popularized discussions of the relations between language and thought in terms of the overt-covert distinction,9 his insights in this area clearly provide the groundwork for his com­ parison of English and Hopi and for a much more sophisticated theory of language and thought interaction.
Language classifications vary across languages
Although Whorf followed Boas and Sapir in indicating that the classifi­ cations implicit in linguistic forms varied considerably across languages, he was able to add new depth and scope to the traditional arguments. By emphasizing detailed case studies ( 1 956a, pp . 134--59, 207-19, 233-45) , rather than the citation of isolated examples typical of his predecessors, he was able to show how specific , often minor, differences in such classifications could cumulatively signal quite general , often major, underlying differences in fundamental approach to the linguistic repre­ sentation of reality - what he came to call different "fashions of speaking . " In his case studies , Whorf worked to show that differences in the classifications of various languages are semantically integrated and structurally pervasive. They are semantically integrated in that each conceptual distinction works with many others to form a coordinated, coherent set within each language - hence many differences between languages are better characterized in terms of patterns of differences that operate across entire systems. For example , a pattern of treating imaginary entities as if they were concrete objects ("objectification ," in Whorf's terminology) can be identified in rules of English pluralization , quantification , time expressions, etc. , while the Hopi language differs in each case so as to deny, or ignore, such a pattern of treatment (1956a, pp. 134--59) . A series of minor differences cumulate to indicate a significant underlying pattern. The classifications are structurally per­ vasive in that they operate , or are carried , in multiple kinds of formal apparatus. Thus, to continue the previous example , morphological,

32

Language diversity and thought

syntactic, and lexical devices all contribute to the English pattern of classification. Whorf summarized these points by noting that such conceptual differences between languages

do not depend so much upon ANY ONE SYSTEM (e .g. , tense , or nouns) within the

grammar as upon the ways of analyzing and reporting experience which have

become fixed in the language as integrated "fashions of speaking" and which cut

across the typical grammatical classifications, so that such a "fashion" may

include lexical , morphological , syntactic, and otherwise systemically diverse

means coordinated in a certain frame of consistency.

(1956a , p. 158)

.

Essentially, Whorf drew out in detail the implications of Sapir's argu­

ments about the systemic, interlocking nature of the linguistic analysis of

experience for the project of linguistic comparison . His studies reveal

that differences in linguistic classifications may range across the whole of

the morpholexical and syntactic structures of the languages. 10

Whorf realized that the very variety of languages posed a problem for

comparison of linguistic categories. Contrary to the popular image of

Whorf as a dogmatic relativist , he firmly believed in the possibility of

meaningful comparison and generalization. ! ! The key concern in his

approach , however, was to find a frame of reference for comparison that

would be independent of the particularities of any given language:

To compare ways in which different languages differently "segment" the same

situation or experience , it is desirable to be able to analyze or "segment" the

experience first in a way independent of any one language or linguistic stock , a

way which will be the same for all observers.

(1956a, p. 162)

Whorf proposed both nonlinguistic and linguistic solutions to this problem of "calibration ," as he termed it (1956a, p. 214) - solutions which are also important for the insight they give regarding his general views on the nature of linguistic variation and universals.
Whorf occasionally raised the possibility that frames of comparison based on nonlinguistic grounds could be found:

In describing differences between [languages] . . . we must have a way of

describing phenomena by non-linguistic standards , and by terms that refer to

experience as it must be to all human beings, irrespective of their languages or

philosophies.

(1956b [ 1938], p. 6)

The principal such standard directly suggested by Whorf lay in the laws of visual perception discovered by Gestalt psychology:

A discovery made by modern configurative or Gestalt psychology gives us a

canon of reference for all observers, irrespective of their languages or scientific

jargons, by which to break down and describe all visually observable situations,

and many other situations, also. This is the discovery that visual perception is

basically the same for all normal persons past infancy and conforms to definite

laws, a large number of which are fairly well known .

(1956a, p. 163)

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Whorf 33

Whorf gives examples of the application of this technique in a description of Shawnee stem composition ( 1 956a, pp. 160-72) and in the relative modes of expressing figure and ground relations in English and Hopi ( 1 956b [ 1938] , pp . 7-9). The latter example , which is the only one that tries to use Gestalt ideas for language comparison, is, unfortunately , only slightly developed and was never published by Whorf. It should perhaps be clarified that the principal role played by Gestalt psychology in Whorf's thinking was the much more general one of reinforcing his belief (and that of Sapir's circle) in the importance of pattern and configuration in all human activity (e .g. , 1956a, pp. 41-42 , 158, 248) - and that these specific applications were secondary. Nonetheless , they clearly point to a concern on Whorf's part to give language comparison an unbiased foundation. 12
At times, Whorf also seemed to embrace the view that modern physical science or logic could serve as bases for nonlinguistic evaluation, and hence calibration, of language categories. This view emerges in his early writings when he discusses the superior fit of implicit Hopi metaphysics with modern physics, in contrast to the implicit metaphysics of the Indo-European languages ( 1 956a , pp. 55-56, 85) . These argu­ ments reflect his concern , in line with the Boasian tradition , with defending Indian and other exotic languages against those who would label them "primitive" in some respect. A similar view emerges when he makes reference to a language category being "more rational , closer to natural fact" (1956a, p. 80) , in his attempt to establish the reality and significance of covert categories.
Most of Whorf's writings , however, reflect a more balanced view of the referential equivalence of various languages and a more skeptical view of the utility of modern physical science as a basis for comparison. He usually argued that the alternative views of the world encapsulated in language categories are functionally equivalent or equal in value . Writing on the Hopi language , he remarked:

the Hopi language is capable of accounting for and describing correctly, in a

pragmatic or operational sense . all observable phenomena of the universe . . .

Just as it is possible to have any number of geometries other than the Euclidean

which give an equally perfect account of space configurations , so it is possible to

have descriptions of the universe . all equally valid. that do not contain our

familiar contrasts of time and space .

( 1956a. p. 58)

The differences among languages are those of "emphasis" ( 1 956a , pp . 147-48) or of relative ease in making some distinction which might be of use in certain circumstances (1956a, pp. 217, 265) - not of fundamental referential potential or subtlety ( 1 956a . pp. 84-85 . 263 ; 1941 . pp. 13-14) . 13 Further , in his later writings directed toward an audience of natural scientists, he became especially critical of modern

34

Language diversity and thought

physical science and Western logic as sure guides to reality . He referred to the underlying vagueness of their concepts (1956a, p. 260) , to their dependence on naive concepts in the Indo-European type of language ( 1 956a , pp. 214-19, 22 1-22, 263 , 266, 269) , and to the tendency of scientific sublanguages to build in points of view that impede the acceptance of alternative views ( 1 956a, pp. 246-47) . Thus, on the whole , Whorf was skeptical of using contemporary physical science and logic as a basic frame for the comparison of the categories of diverse languages.
Most often , Whorf advocated building a vocabulary or frame of comparison directly from the study of languages . Unfortunately, the grammatical terms developed in the study of European languages are inadequate because of the close historical relationship among these languages, which limits the range of observed variation. The close historical relationship operates on several levels:

Among these [EuropeanJ tongues there is a unanimity of major pattern which . . . exists only because these tongues are all Indo-European dialects cut to the same basic plan, being historically transmitted from what was long ago one speech community; because the modern dialects have long shared in building up a common culture ; and because much of this culture , on the more intellectual side , is derived from the linguistic backgrounds of Latin and Greek. (1956a, p. 214)

The commonalities are so great that , in contrast with other languages in the world such as Hopi , Whorf felt comfortable in grouping them together as a single language which he called Standard Average Euro­ pean (SAE) (1956a, p. 138) . To remedy the problems stemming from concepts developed on so narrow a basis, Whorf advocated a widescale survey of languages to provide the basis for an adequate understanding of the true range of variation among languages ( 1 956a, pp . 76-78 , 84, 87 , 239, 244-45) . What is needed is a true "contrastive" linguistics to plot "the outstanding differences among tongues - in grammar, logic, and general analysis of experience" ( 1 956a , p. 240) . From such a linguistics will come a more correct image of the nature both of language in general and of particular languages.
Whorf realized that such a contrastive survey would of necessity involve the use of traditional , inadequate terms, but he felt that with an awareness of the problem , new conceptual frames could eventually be developed:

The very natural tendency to use terms derived from traditional grammar, like verb, noun, adjective , passive voice , in describing languages outside of Indo­ European is fraught with grave possibilities of misunderstanding. At the same time it is desirable to define these terms in such a way that we can avail ourselves of their great convenience and, where possible , apply them to exotic languages in a scientific and consistent way. To do this, we must re-examine the types of grammatical category that are found in languages, using a worldwide view of

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Whorf 35

linguistic phenomena, frame concepts more or less new , and make needed

additions to terminology.

(1956a, p. 87)

Cautious use of such terms may be helpful, perhaps unavoidable , but it must be

remembered that in their ranges of meaning they are but the creatures of modern

Indo-European languages and their subsidiary j argons, and reflect the typical

modes of segmenting experience in these tongues.

( 1 956a, p. 162)

(See also Whorf, 1956a, pp. 59, 242.) Whorf went beyond exhortation on this issue . He developed new conceptualizations of grammatical cate­ gories (some of which have been discussed above) more suitable for the general comparison of languages (1956a , pp . 87-101 ) and indicated the proper approach to the development of generic taxonomic categories for grammatical comparisons (1956a, p. 101) . He also provided the detailed beginnings of a format for the systematic survey of languages, one founded on both his own theoretical insights and the experience of the Boas-Sapir and Bloomfield schools of linguistic study ( 1 956a , pp. 125-33) . He felt that by a process of iterative reformulation , a vocabulary adequate to the task of linguistic description could be built .
In suggesting the development of a specifically linguistic frame of comparison built on the contrastive study of languages, Whorf implied that he believed there is a specifically linguistic level of generality for the description of both language variation and commonality. Occasionally he was explicit on this point:

Just as cultural facts are only culturally determined , not biologically determined,

so linguistic facts, which are likewise cultural, and include the linguistic element

of thought, are only linguistically determined. They are determined not merely

by language , but by languagES .

(1956a , p. 67 [n5])14

But there are some passages that suggest that if commonalities among languages exist , they may not in fact reflect specifically linguistic reg­ ularities:

The different tongues are the real phenomena and may generalize down not to

any such universal as "Language ," but to something better - called "sublinguis­

tic" or "superlinguistic" - and NOT ALTOGETHER unlike , even if much unlike , what

we now call mental .

( 1956a, p. 239)

(See also Wharf, 1956a, p. 36. ) Although this remark seems to contra­ dict the ones cited just above, in fact it does not. It merely asserts that it may be the case that a nonlinguistic level exerts its influence not on some general capacity "Language" but rather on individual "languages. " And the postulation of a general "Language" faculty that lies behind the cross-linguistic pattern may add nothing of descriptive or theoretical interest.
Although Whorf's first concerns were to stress the importance of

36

Language diversity and thought

linguistic variation and the need for a frame of comparison independent of any single language or language group , these discussions also show his positive attitude toward the search for commonalities, or universals, across languages and his openness to considering both specifically linguistic and extralinguistic factors as the basis for such commonality. Specifically, his search for an unbiased frame of comparison , his desire for a broad survey of the world's languages , and his interest in the general categories of description for language all reflect this positive attitude . Too often Whorf's concern with pressing the significance of linguistic variation - both for linguistics and for the other sciences - has led to the neglect by others of this aspect of his work . Whorf explored the variation and hence the "relativity" of linguistic categories in the service of overcoming their influence , and not as an end in itself. As he remarked on one occasion : "science CAN have a rational or logical basis even though it be a relativistic one" (1956a , p. 239) , once we control for the biases of our language through contrastive linguistics.

Language classifications are out-oj-awareness
Turning next to the out-of-awareness , or unconscious , nature of linguis­ tic categories, Whorf agreed for the most part with Boas and Sapir, but he elaborated their arguments in some crucial ways. Whorf did not explicitly mention Boas's early arguments about automaticity. Instead, he emphasized a related argument that languages are background phenomena for speakers and are not easily brought to conscious atten­ tion because of the lack of contrasting examples:
if a rule has absolutely no exceptions, it is not recognized as a rule or as anything else ; it is then part of the background of experience of which we tend to remain unconscious. Never having experienced anything in contrast to it, we cannot isolate it and formulate it as a rule until we so enlarge our experience and expand our base of reference that we encounter an interruption of its regularity.
(1956a , p. 209)
(See also Whorf, 1956a , pp. 138 and 2 1 1 . ) In this , language is not distinctive from other parts of culture . In fact , the background nature of language is guaranteed precisely by the social (or interpersonal) nature of language , which compels agreement to effect communication :
We cut nature up, organize it into concepts , and ascribe significances as we do, largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this way - an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the patterns of our language . The agreement is, of course , an implicit and unstated one , BUT ITS TERMS ARE ABSOLUTELY OBLIGATORY ; we cannot talk at all except by

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Whorf 37

subscribing to the organization and classification of data which the agreement

decrees.

( 1 956a , pp. 213-14) 15

Thus, this background quality is not an accidental and easily modified characteristic of language, but rather is an intrinsic part of the social
process of language usage .
Speakers are so powerfully bound b y this background agreement that even when they are exposed to a very different language , they will tend to analyze it in terms of their own language categories. In spite of this, Whorf consistently advocated the study of the novel modes of expression in exotic languages16 as the surest and perhaps the only route to bringing many linguistic categories into consciousness:

the best approach is through an exotic language , for in its study we are at long last

pushed willy-nilly out of our ruts. Then we find that the exotic language is a

mirror held up to our own .

(1956a , p. 138)

(See also Whorf, 1956a, p. 1 12.) In a sense , we de-automatize our own language categories by contrasting them with those of other languages. This view led quite naturally to Whorf's concern with a world-wide comparison of languages with the goal of identifying general grammatical types that could be used to give an "objective" characterization of each language , that is, one free of the particular background assumptions of the investigator's native tongue.
Whorf also discussed Sapir's argument that people attend more to function than form , but he directed his remarks somewhat more specifically to language. He pointed out that people see language as a vehicle for expressing thought, that is, they see language as functional , and regard its form as irrelevant ( 1 956a , p. 207) . Further, they equate agreement about subject matter with knowledge of language processes ( 1 956a , p. 2 1 1 ) . Sapir also discussed the difficulty of segmenting out one element in a cultural pattern and understanding its relation to the whole . Whorf made similar remarks, stressing the tremendous complexity of linguistic patterns (e .g. , 1956a , pp. 21 1 and 256) , and the difficulty, even for the specialist , of analyzing these forms. This all formed part of Whorf's general argument that pattern in language is more important than lexation ( 1 956a , pp. 246-70) .
But Whorf went somewhat further than Sapir in making reference to speakers' explicit beliefs (or ideologies) about language itself. He emphasized that speakers have the view that language reflects an independently organized reality and thought rather than shapes or affects them in a significant way ( 1 956a, pp . 207 , 221 , 238, 25 1 , 257) . He also referred on occasion to native "theories" about the structure and meaning of linguistic categories (e .g. , 1956a, pp. 258-63). Whorf's principal claim was that speakers can readily reflect on lexical meanings

38

Language diversity and thought

but tend to be completely oblivious to the patterned grammatical meanings which ultimately govern a lexical item. And overt categories were more susceptible to the critical consciousness of speakers than covert categories with their cryptotypes. In short, some aspects of language are more susceptible to conscious awareness than are others . These remarks suggest that under certain circumstances speakers can and do reflect upon some aspects of their linguistic categories and that these reflections will be skewed by differential awareness of those categories.
Further, at another level, Whorf's argument for analogical influences of language on thought (discussed below) depends on there being a specific directionality of influence among connected categories because of their formal properties or substantive content . This implies a differen­ tial salience for thought of some aspects of linguistic form and meaning relative to other aspects. This might be characterized as a differential intuitive awareness . Whether we speak of intuitive or conscious awareness, however, the implication remains the same: speakers do not respond to all aspects of their language in an unbiased way. They bring to both use and reflection a differential awareness of some forms and meanings relative to others. This emphasis on differential sensitivity to or awareness of language structure represents a crucial and novel element in Whorf's subsequent arguments about the influence of language on thought and culture.

The relation of languages to thought and culture
Language classifications influence thought
Whorf, like Sapir before him , felt that language classifications influenced thought and, therefore , that the diversity of those classifications insured a certain diversity of thought among the speakers of different languages . Whorf referred to this as the linguistic relativity principle :
These automatic, involuntary patterns of language are not the same for all men but are specific for each language and constitute the formalized side of the language , or its "grammar" . . .
From this fact proceeds what I have called the "linguistic relativity principle ," which means , in informal terms , that users of markedly different grammars are pointed by the grammars toward different types of observations and different evaluations of externally similar acts of observation , and hence are not equiv­ alent as observers but must arrive at somewhat different views of the world .
(1956a, p. 221 )

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Whorf 39
(See also Whorf, 1956a , p . 214.) Unlike Sapir, however, Whorf took up in considerable detail j ust how speakers are "pointed by their gram­ mars . " His central treatment of the problem is given in his article "The relation of habitual thought and behavior to language" (1956a, pp. 124-59) , which serves as the principal basis for the discussion in this section, although his other writings will be used to supplement the analysis. 17 In this article he specified the focus of research , laid out a theoretical mechanism to account for the influence of language on thought, and provided empirical evidence in support of his claims .

Focus of research

Whorf was very explicit about the focus of his research , summarizing his concerns as follows:

That portion of the whole investigation here to be reported may be summed up in

two questions: (1) Are our own concepts of 'time ,' 'space ,' and 'matter' given

in substantially the same form by experience to all men , or are they in part

conditioned by the structure of particular languages? (2) Are there traceable

affinities between (a) cultural and behavioral norms and (b) large-scale linguistic

patterns?

(1956a, p. 138)

Embedded within these two questions are clear indications of the aspects of language and of thought that were of concern to Whorf in his study. On the linguistic side he was interested in the pervasive structural (or grammatical) patterns which are characteristic of particular languages. On the cognitive side he was interested in the fundamental conceptual ideas habitually used by speakers of those languages. The importance of language for culture more broadly will emerge in the discussion of Whorf's evidence for his ideas and will also be treated explicitly below in a separate section, following Whorf's own division of the research problem into two distinct, though admittedly related, questions.
Whorf's concern with "the structure of particular languages" and with "large-scale linguistic patterns" was consistent with his emphasis else­ where on complex grammatical categories and on the importance of overall patternment in language , issues that have been discussed in detail above . Whorf did describe how the "names" of situations influence behavior in the prelude to the above quotation, but only because these lexations and other simple overt patterns provide especially clear examples of the point he wished to make . IS His basic concern with more complicated and pervasive patternment is made quite explicit in his transition from these introductory examples to the two central questions quoted above:

40

Language diversity and thought

The linguistic material in the above examples is limited to single words, phrases,

and patterns of limited range . One cannot study the behavioral compulsiveness

of such material without suspecting a much more far-reaching compulsion from

large-scale patterning of grammatical categories , such as plurality, gender and

similar classifications (animate, inanimate, etc . ) , tenses, voices, and other verb

forms, classifications of the type of "parts of speech , " and the matter of whether

a given experience is denoted by a unit morpheme , an inflected word , or a

syntactical combination .

( 1 956a , p. 137)

In short, although Whorf did not deny that more limited, or isolated, aspects of a language might have effects on thinking, he felt that broad patterns of signification and formal structure in language are a more potent source of effects. His subsequent analyses and examples consti­ tuted an attempt to identify differences in the broad patterns of the two particular languages with which he was concerned - Hopi and English. 19 The patterns that he finds "do not depend . . . upon ANY ONE SYSTEM • . • within the grammar" but rather "cut across the typical grammatical classifications" ( 1 956a, p. 1 58) . It is more this complex patterning, or "fashion of speaking, " that Whorf sought to connect with thought rather than , as some have supposed, particular isolated differences between languages.
On the cognitive side, Whorf said that his interest was in our own "concepts" such as '' 'time ,' 'space ,' and 'matter. ' " This indicates that his focus was on tracing the connection between linguistic categories and the most fundamental abstract ideas that a person uses in interpreting experience. This focus on the conceptual level appeared throughout his writings, although often with different labels such as abstractions, cate­ gories and types, and grand generalizations ( 1 956a, pp. 58-59, 213-16). Also consistent with this interpretation are his many references to the influence of language on an individual's or people's Weltanschauung, metaphysics, unformulated philosophy, cosmology , worldview , ideology of nature , and picture (or description or view) of the universe ( 1 956a, pp. 58-6 1 , 2 14-16, 221 , 241-42) . Such concepts may be linguistically conditioned either directly (as with time and matter in the following passage) or indirectly (as with space in the following passage) on account of their interaction with directly conditioned concepts in an overall system of thought:

There is no such striking difference between Hopi and S[tandard] A[verage] E[uropean] about space as about time , and probably the apprehension of space is given in substantially the same form by experience irrespective of language. The experiments of the Gestalt psychologists with visual perception appear to establish this as a fact. But the CONCEPT OF SPACE will vary somewhat with language , because , as an intellectual tool , it is so closely linked with the con­ comitant employment of other intellectual tools, of the order of "time" and "matter," which are linguistically conditioned. We see things with our eyes in the

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Whorf 4 1

same space forms as the Hopi , but our idea of space has also the property of

acting as a surrogate of nonspatial relationships.

( 1 956a, pp. 158-59)

Exactly how language conditions thought will be taken up in more detail shortly .
Whorf's notion of "concepts" needs to be distinguished from more direct, lower-level processes of perception . The existence of an under­ lying distinction in Whorf's thinking between concepts and percepts (sometimes labeled sensations, impressions, or apprehensions) emerges in the passage cited just above, wherein he distinguishes between the apprehension of space and the concept of space, between space as we see it and our idea of space . Even when discussing time and matter earlier in his discussion , he implicitly invoked a similar distinction with his refer­ ences to basic experiences which underlie our understandings. For time , he mentioned the "subjective 'becoming later' that is the essence of time" and the "subjective experience" or "feeling" of temporal duration that is covered or cloaked by linguistically induced patterns ( 1 956a, pp. 141-43) . For matter, he referred to "the observable appearance" of things which , he noted, comes into conflict with linguistically induced patterns ( 1 956a , p. 141 ) . Throughout his writings Whorf made appeal to such direct experiences with or apprehensions of natural phenomena, implying that there is a lower level ofpsychic experience to which we can, on occasion , have access.
Whorf was rarely explicit about this perceptual level, especially as to whether it can be directly influenced by language or not. Appeals to this level in his accounts suggest that fundamental perceptions are not in fact actually altered. This view gains support from the following remark indicating that certain psychic experiences are not destroyed but merely given different emphasis:

What surprises most is to find that various grand generalizations of the Western

world, such as time , velocity, and matter, are not essential to the construction of

a consistent picture of the universe. The psychic experiences that we class under

these headings are , of course , not destroyed; rather, categories derived from

other kinds of experience take over the rulership of the cosmology and seem to

function just as well .

( 1 956a, p. 216)

(See also Whorf, 1956a , p. 267 for a similar remark. ) However, there are cases in which he seemed to hint at an influence on perception itself, as in the following:

The categories and types that we isolate from the world of phenomena we do not find there because they stare every observer in the face ; on the contrary, the world is presented in a kaleidoscopic flux of impressions which has to be organized by our minds - and this means largely by the linguistic systems in our

42

Language diversity and thought

minds . We cut nature up , organize it into concepts , and ascribe significances as

we do , largely because we are parties to an agreement to organize it in this way ­

an agreement that holds throughout our speech community and is codified in the

patterns of our language.

(1956a , p. 2 13)

Although Whorf may have been referring here to the perceptual level by the phrase "cut nature up ," the comment more probably refers to the way language itself as a classificatory device segments nature . In fact , most of his statements about fundamental analysis of experience are actually statements about how language "chops up," "segments," or "breaks down" experience (1956a , pp . 137, 24� 1 , 253 ; 1956b ( 1938] , p . 8) , and not direct statements about perception itself. 20 Thus the evidence that he believed that language directly influences perception is slender and inconsistent.
Whorf's position on this issue probably derived at least in part from his views on the nature of the external world. Whorf regarded the external world as essentially unstructured from the point of view of a speaker. This view is evidenced by his use of such terms as "stream of sensory experience ," "raw experience , " "kaleidoscopic flux of impressions , " "flux o f experience , " "mass o f presentation , " "flowing face o f nature ," and "continuous spread and flow of existence ," (1956a , pp. 55, 102, 2 13 , 239, 241 , 253 ; 1956b [1938] , p. 8) . Whorf was critical of those logicians who pick out tables, chairs, and other human artifacts as examples for their discussions of the relation of words to reality :

Man's artifacts and the agricultural products he severs from living plants have a

unique degree of isolation ; we may expect that languages will have fairly isolated

terms for them. The real question is: What do different languages do , not with

these artificially isolated objects but with the flowing face of nature in its motion ,

color , and changing form . . . ?

(1956a , pp. 240-41 )

The view that experience is so little structured probably has its origin in Whorf's encounter with a variety of languages that treat the apparently "same" reality so differently . Once established , however, the presump­ tion of this absence of structure leads directly to the question of where the rich conceptual structures evidenced by people have their origin. Whorf's answer was that they lie in language, i.e. , his very point of departure for the discovery of variation . When, however, Whorf encountered a conceptual structure that was different from his own and yet that he could understand, or when he found a nearly identical structure in several languages, he was led to postulate an underlying level of more fundamental experience (i . e . , a more direct perceptual appre­ hension) to which he could refer his understanding or the emergence of parallel patterns in diverse languages. Thus this implicit perceptual level created by Whorf is more or less a residual category in his writings that he

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Whorf 43

used to account for the absence of linguistic relativity in certain cases or at certain levels of analysis. Such perceptual regularities, if and when they exist , do not tend to be particularly significant because of the more important, complex overlay of higher-level conceptual structures which are to a large extent linguistically based. (Recall the example of 'space' cited above. ) When variation is present, then it is viewed as a difference in the conceptual analysis, emphasis, or organization of essentially similar experience, the distinction between concepts and percepts being disregarded (or neutralized) in this context. Thus, the conclusion here is that Whorf's primary interest was in concepts and that percepts were of minor or secondary importance to his theory; the locus of linguistic influence is on conceptual structure .
It should be clear that Whorf's theory was about the content of thought (hence "concepts") , rather than process, although certainly content

guides processing and in that sense is indistinguishable from it in most cases . This focus on content is often misunderstood because of Whorf's imprecise use of psychological terminology. He sometimes referred to reasoning being influenced by language when he meant only to refer to the importance of linguistic meaning (or patternment) and agreement about subject matter in forming our thought categories ( 1 956a ,

pp. 73-74, 208-12) . He referred to some ideas being more rational , by which he meant that discriminations of reality are used that are closer to "natural fact , " that is, relatively uninfluenced by language or with language's influence partialed out by linguistic comparison ( 1 956a , pp. 80, 85 , 239) . And he referred to logic when he really meant to refer to problems engendered by different premises or postulates underlying logic or discriminations about what constitutes an object in logic ( 1 956a, pp. 59, 80, 207-209, 233 , 244) . On a few occasions Whorf actually mentioned thought processes, but always in a context in which he was emphasizing the importance of cultural and linguistic content in thought ( 1 956a , pp. 65-68, 207 , 218, 239). The issues involved in the content­

process dichotomy are subtle and difficult (certainly more involved than can be taken up here) , and Whorf probably had no well-formed view of

the matter. Nonetheless, his entire enterprise can , in one sense, be thought of as an attempt to show that much of what we think of as process (and, hence, intrinsic and universal) is better regarded as content (that is, extrinsic and variable).
Further, when Whorf spoke o f "concepts" h e was not primarily referring to more removed specialized notions of philosophy or science , but rather to the habitual thought characteristic of average speakers of the language . He explained that this habitual thought world:

is the microcosm that each man carries about within himself, by which he

measures and understands what he can of the macrocosm .

( 1 956a, p. 147)

44

Language diversity and thought

Although the references to habitual thought are most pronounced in the discussion just cited, similar remarks appear throughout his writings (e . g . , 1956a , pp . 69, 79 , 22 1 , 266) .
In Whorf's view , specialized conceptual systems such as science and philosophy tend to be built upon such a system of everyday concepts. They arise by a specialization of the same linguistic patterns that gave rise to the more widespread habitual thought pattern :

From each such unformulated and naive world view , an explicit scientific world

view may arise by a higher specialization of the same basic grammatical patterns

that fathered the naive and implicit view. Thus the world view of modern science

arises by a higher specialization of the basic grammar of the Western Indo­

European languages. Science of course was not CAUSED by this grammar; it was

simply colored by it.

(1956a, p. 221)

Throughout his later writings , Whorf made similar statements arguing that to the extent that science , philosophy, logic, and mathematics emerge in a culture , they are dependent on (and frequently little more than) specialized extensions of language patterns ( 1 956a , pp . 152-53 , 208 , 236 , 246, 248 , 263 , 266) . Although the concepts characteristic of these fields are especially dependent on language from Whorf's point of view, this should not obscure the fact that these specialized forms of thought are really secondary reflexes of the more basic phenomenon , namely that languages influence habitual everyday thought .21
Whorf occasionally implied that science and philosophy could go against the prevailing habitual pattern of concepts , as , for example , when he remarked that

Monistic, holistic, and relativistic views of reality appeal to philosophers and

some scientists, but they are badly handicapped in appealing to the "common

sense" of the Western average man.

(1956a, p. 152)

And again this point arose when he discussed the emergence of the concept of the "field" in modern physics (1956a , pp . 241 , 269) . But to the extent that scientists and philosophers succeed in breaking out of their habitual language patterns, they do so by constructing "what amounts to a new language" ( 1 956a , p. 152) . However, as was emphasized earlier, Whorf tended, on the whole, to argue that Western science and phi­ losophy are very much influenced by traditional Indo-European language categories (1956a , pp . 214, 246 , 260 , 263) , a situation that can only be remedied by contrastive linguistics, which will reveal to people their linguistic biases.
We can summarize this discussion of Whorf's focus on the cognitive side by saying that he was interested primarily in the concepts people routinely use in interpreting their experience . He was less interested in either direct, lower-level perceptions or in more removed specialized

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Whorf 45
concepts . He recognized linguistic influences on these latter two levels as well , but always via the central conceptual patterns and organizations typical of everyday life . In this focus on pattern and embeddedness in higher-level structures , we find a parallel between his linguistic and cognitive concerns ; just as words are nothing without sentences (or sets of sentences) , so elements of experience , percepts , and even specialized ideas (e.g. , science and philosophy) are nothing without the everyday pattern of concepts within which they are interpreted. The focus of Whorf's research then is on the connections between these two pattern schemes, that of language and that of thought . 22
Basic argument
Whorf did not present a fully developed, explicit theory of how language structure influences concepts, but rather gave a programmatic discussion based on the analysis of a few selected, interrelated examples. Under­ lying his analyses, however, were the outlines of an implicit theory and some indications of how he would have filled in the outlines . For discursive clarity Whorf's ideas will be extracted and presented here in schematic form as if they in fact constituted an explicit formal theory. A good part of the material on which this extraction is based either has been presented already in the discussion above or will emerge in the discussion of Whorf's evidence below.
First , Whorf argued , as we have seen , that a language can unite demonstrably different aspects of reality by giving them similar linguistic treatment . The principle for such a grouping of aspects of reality Whorf called linguistic analogy23 to indicate its specifically linguistic nature ( 1 956a, pp. 135 , 137, 142, 147 , 148; also pp. 70, 215) , although he sometimes uses other terms (for example 1956a, pp. 36, 67-7 1 ) . Every language must have some classifications (see discussion of Boas in chapter 1) and hence induce some linguistic analogies. The classifi­ cations, and the analogies implicit in them, (1) may be covert or overt or a mixture of the two , (2) are not "necessary" in that they vary from language to language and so cannot be simply "given" by experience prior to language , and (3) are potentially distinctive from other kinds of analyses of experience such as those of science or naive experience . The importance of such linguistic classifications is that the meanings of elements that are grouped together influence each other, that is, they are analogically interpreted as "the same. " Further, in Whorf's grammatical examples , the direction of influence seems to exhibit internal pattern or regularity . Thus, forms with direct perceptible meanings influence the interpretation of forms with less direct , less perceptible meanings when

46

Language diversity and thought

such forms are grouped together in a linguistic classification . Likewise , complex forms in which each part has a directly perceptible meaning influence the interpretation of similar complex forms without such direct form-function matches as well as of simple forms with which they are linguistically grouped . All this yields a vision of language as a formal classificatory device that is both distinctively linguistic and internally interactive along lines of differential salience .
Second , Whorf argued that such linguistic analogies are used in thought as guides in the interpretation of and behavioral response to experienced reality. Whorf had no single term or expression for this process, referring variously to language "conditioning" or "shaping" thought (1956a, pp. 135-47) , to thought "marching in step with purely grammatical facts" ( 1956a, p. 2 1 1 ) , to language as a "program and guide for the individual's mental activity" (1956a, p. 212) , to thought being "pointed by . . . grammars toward different types of observation" ( 1956a, p . 221 ) , and to thinking following "a network of tracks laid down in the given language" (1956a, p. 256) . In this discussion the phrase cognitive appropriation will be used to refer to the use in thought for its own ends of a structure of relations deriving from some other domain or, to be more precise , of a structure regimented according to some principles other than purely cognitive ones. One can imagine a number of kinds of structures that might be so appropriated: language is only one . Whorf's task was to provide evidence for the cognitive appropriation of linguistic analogies.
Whorf's view was , as we have noted , that the principal influence of language would be on habitual everyday concepts wherein speakers take (i. e . , appropriate) language patterns as guides to the nature of reality. When using language patterns as a tool in this way, speakers involve the whole range of associations and connections implicit in the language's analogical groupings . However, speakers are unaware of this influence in two ways: in the first place they do not usually recognize that they are using language at all since the process of appropriation is largely unconscious (1956a, p. 137; also see pp. 209-14); and in the second place the very linguistic analogies themselves are usually out-of"awareness. Thus, speakers unwittingly accept much of the suggestive value of the linguistic analogies in their language even when, upon reflection, they might recognize that they are misleading. Use of language as a tool in this way involves, then, certain unintended costs. We may schematize Whorf's argument as in figure l .
Unfortunately, Whorf did not go on to address directly the issues of when or why such appropriation of language structures occurs - for example , what the associated advantages are for individuals or social groups.24 This is a significant omission in his discussion which relates to

Figure 1 Diagram of Whorf's basic argument. Some aspect of a "situation" is immediately and subjectively "experienced" by a speaker of a particular language . This experience can be interpreted in terms of a 'linguistic meaning
a' which corresponds to a linguistic form x. The linguistic form x also corresponds to other linguistic meanings such as 'linguistic meaning b . ' By virtue of 'a' and 'b' being grouped together under x, they, and the experiences which they label or refer to, are seen to be analogically "the same" even though in some respects they are not in fact the same at all . This grouping of experiences via their linkage in a linguistic pattern is "linguistic analogy . " If the speaker in interpreting or reflecting on his immediate subjective experience uses ("cognitively appropriates") the linguistic classification in the form of meaning 'a,' this linguistic analogy is called into play and he will respond to the experience associated with 'a' in terms of meanings properly associated only with 'b. ' His subjective experience then becomes colored by his language yielding "linguistically conditioned habitual thought. " If this thought is then used as a basis for some response , it should be detectable in the speaker's subsequent "behavior" - at least in certain situations.

questions that we will take up further below as to whether the process or existence of cognitive appropriation oflinguistic analogies is itself shaped by the nature of the cognitive task or by the immediate or broader cultural contexts within which thought takes place. Whorf may have believed the process to be unaffected by such variables, as is suggested by some of his comments (e.g. , 1956a, pp. 214, 257 ; also pp. 73 , 85 , 159, 207, 212, 235 , 237) . However, since he said almost nothing on this topic, it is likely that he simply did not recognize the problem of functional significance and contingency, and felt that the cognitive appropriation of linguistic analogies was a universal process.

48 Language diversity and thought

Empirical evidence
Whorf attempted to provide evidence for his theory through a variety of examples. His basic method involved showing a parallelism between a linguistic pattern and some non linguistic behavior. First he established the characteristically linguistic nature of the language analogy. This he did by showing it either to be at odds with an analysis on some nonlinguistic grounds, usually by appeal to science or naive experience , or to be at odds with the analysis implicit in a second language , which showed that the pattern was variable by language . Second , he examined some nonlinguistic behavior to establish that the linguistic analogy had a parallel in nonlinguistic behavior and , when two languages were involved , that the parallels were distinctive . Whorf then inferred that the linguistic behavior was responsible for the nonlinguistic one . Thus , his method is essentially correiationaF5 (in the broad sense of that term Whorf, 1956a , p. 139, explicitly disavows that it is correlational in the strict sense , that is, of connecting individual features of language with individual features of culture) , since without a specification of the conditions regulating the decision to appropriate linguistic analogies, true experimental manipulation is not possible . This need not be a fatal problem since correlational evidence can be relatively convincing when gathered properly, i.e . , so that alternative accounts become increasingly unlikely. In Whorf's own programmatic work , however, the parallelisms or associations, although interpretively rich, were not particularly rigor­ ous, a fact often stressed by Whorf's critics. Nonetheless , they provided an outline of a method that does in fact address the issues he was interested in. Attempts by others to infuse more rigor into such studies (see chapters 5 and 6 below) have tended to trade away both interpretive richness and relevance to the original hypothesis; for this reason Whorf's techniques warrant further study despite their deficiencies.

Lexical analogies

Whorf's first evidence of the importance of language for thought was drawn from his work as a fire inspector for an insurance company . He noticed that people act toward reality not merely in terms of the physical situation (as a fire inspector would see it) but in terms of the meaning of that situation to them:

in due course it became evident that not only a physical situation qua physics, but

the meaning of that situation to people , was sometimes a factor, through the

behavior of the people , in the start of the fire . And this factor of meaning was

clearest when it was a LINGUISTIC MEANING , residing in the name or the linguistic

description commonly applied to the situation.

(1956a, p. 135)

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Whorf 49

Whorf presented a variety of examples of this phenomeno n . The first and most famous example involved careless behavior around what are called "empty gasoline drums, " where the descriptive term empty tends to suggest lack of hazard.

Yet the "empty" drums are perhaps the more dangerous [in comparison with the

full drums] , since they contain explosive vapor. Physically the situation is

hazardous, but the linguistic analysis according to regular analogy must employ

tuhseedwoinrdtw'eomplitnyg,u' iwsthicic.hpaintteevrintas:bl(y1s)uagsgeastsvilratcukalofsyhnaoznayrdm.

The for

word 'null

'empty' is and void,

negative , inert , ' (2) applied in analysis of physical situations without regard to,

e.g. , vapor, liquid vestiges, or stray rubbish, in the container. The situation is

named in one pattern (2) and the name is then "acted out" or "lived up to" in

another ( 1 ) , this being a general formula for the linguistic conditioning of

behavior into hazardous forms.

( 1 956a , p. 135)

Thus, the word empty has two senses, one a physically direct , more concrete sense in which a container no longer contains its intended contents, that is, has been emptied (questions of residues aside), and a more abstract , general sense meaning null and void , negative , or inert . Speakers apply the term empty in the first , more concrete , sense (i. e . , the gasoline is all gone) and then subsequently interpret it in the second, more abstract , sense (i .e . , the drums are inert , void of force , and therefore no longer dangerous) . Believing the drums are not a hazard tends to lead to careless behavior such as smoking cigarettes near them. The grouping of two meanings under a single linguistic form (in this case a lexeme) creates a connecting bridge between the initial interpretation of the situation and other interpretations that are also associated with the linguistic form but that are not necessarily entailed in the situation. Whorf's argument can be diagramed as in figure 2 , which is drawn so as to parallel the general pattern shown in figure 1 .
Notice in this example that Whorf had presented evidence of the force of linguistic analogy without reference to comparative data from other languages. Rather, a "scientific" language , the account of physical science , is used to show the non-necessary and misleading nature of the linguistic analogy and hence , by implication , its specifically linguistic character. In each example the observable nonlinguistic "effect" is individual behavior - the ignition of a fire along with the inferred set of mental attitudes and ideas that lie behind the act leading tn the fire .
Although to some this linkage may not appear distinctively linguistic, other examples in this series seem much more peculiarly linguistic, such as his discussions of materials called by the terms limestone, waste water, and scrap lead, which turn out to be combustible in certain situations despite their misleading names. Each example from his fire inspector experiences has small flaws , but the series as a whole is suggestive of one

source of data on his hypothesis , namely the everyday ordinary con­ fusions resulting from overreliance on a linguistic label in responding to experience .26 Whorf's presentation of these dramatic if somewhat uncontrolled examples is characteristic in that he is primarily concerned with establishing the significance of language influences.

Grammatical analogies
Whorf moved from these preliminary lexical examples to a series of five interrelated grammatical examples which contrast English27 and Hopi . His first example concerns the grammatical category of number, in par. ticular singular versus plural . He described the English pattern as follows:
In our language . . . plurality and cardinal numbers are applied in two ways: to real plurals and imaginary plurals. Or more exactly if less tersely: perceptible spatial aggregates and metaphorical aggregates. We say 'ten men' and also 'ten days.' Ten men either are or could be objectively perceived as ten, ten in one group perception - ten men on a street corner, for instance . But 'ten days' cannot be objectively experienced. We experience only one day, today ; the other nine (or even all ten) are something conj ured up from memory or imagination . If 'ten days' be regarded as a group it must be as an "imaginary," mentally constructed group. Whence comes this mental pattern? Just as in the case of the fire-causing errors, from the fact that our language confuses the two different situations, has but one pattern for both. When we speak of 'ten steps forward , ten strokes on a bell ,' or any similarly described cyclic sequence , "times" of any sort , we are doing the same thing as with 'days . ' CYCLICITY brings the response of imaginary plurals. But a likeness of cyclicity to aggregates is not unmistakably given by experience prior to language , or it would be found in all languages, and it is not.
( 1956a, p. 139)28

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Whorf 5 1

Thus, the plural category29 applies t o both perceptible spatial aggregates, as in the case of men , and mentally constructed , or imaginary, aggregates of cycles , as in the case of days. The latter can never be perceptually united into an objective spatial group. The pattern with English cardinal numbers reinforces this pattern by quantifying the amount of "time" as if it were in fact a collection of discrete entities rather than an imaginary aggregate formed out of cyclic-interval measures:30

Habitual thought then assumes that in the latter the numbers are just as much

counted on "something" as in the former. This is objectification. Concepts of

time . . . are objectified as counted QUANTITIES , especially lengths, made up of

units as a length can be visibly marked off into inches.

(1956a, p. 140)

Thus "objectification" - the treatment of an imaginary entity such as "time" as if it were a perceptible object - arises in English because the patterns of grammatical number categorize two distinct kinds of experi­ ence , namely the imaginary and the objective , together as alike for the purposes of speech (i . e . , by the formal machinery of English) . 31 We can diagram Whorfs argument (using only the plural portion of it for the sake of clarity) as in the left two columns of figure 3. (The items mentioned under the category "Nonlinguistic observables" in this figure are explained further below in the discussion . )
Whorf showed the "non-necessary" nature o f this linguistic analogy by comparing the English pattern with that of Hopi:

In Hopi there is a different linguistic situation. Plurals and cardinals are used only

for entities that form or can form an obj ective group. There are no imaginary

plurals, but instead ordinals used with singulars.

(1956a , p . 140)

Time is mainly reckoned "by day" . . . or "by night" . . . which words are not

nouns but tensors,32 . . . The count is by ORDINALS . This is not the pattern of

counting a number of different men or things, even though they appear

successively, for, even then , they COULD gather into an assemblage . It is the

pattern ofcounting successive reappearances of the SAME man or thing, incapable

of forming an assemblage . The analogy is not to behave about day-cyclicity as to

several men ("several days"), which is what WE tend to do, but to behave as to the

successive visits of the SAME MAN.

(1956a, p. 148)

Thus, the grammatical pattern by which Hopi handles the phenom­ enon of duration is substantially different from English. The pattern "ordinal number + singular" is applied both to tensors and to nouns that refer to cases of repeated appearance, creating a grammatical bridge between the two. We can diagram the Hopi pattern as in the right two columns of figure 3. In this case , Whorf has used a comparison with a second "natural" language to show the non-necessary character of the English linguistic analogy, rather than a comparison with a "scien,tific" language as in the fire-causing examples.

sented by the central column in figure 3 , is joined with (assimilated into)
different grammatical patterns in English and Hopi and is, therefore ,
subject to different patterns of analogical influence in the two cultures.
Comparing this diagram with the earlier one from Whorf's fire­ causing series, we find a number of changes. The linguistic analogies (the bridges between columns) are regular grammatical patterns rather than individual lexical items. Being grammatical, they cannot be dismissed as possible irregularities with localized significance , but must be recognized as integral parts of the language system. The wider range of application of the patterns is likely to lead to a greater significance in thought ; the more background nature of grammatical patterning is likely to make it much more difficult for speakers to recognize or suspend belief in the ontological validity of the patterns (Whorf, 1956a, pp. 137-38) . A further change in this second example is that the nonlinguistic observa­ bles giving rise to the initial mental interpretations are not clearly spelled out. Whorf did not describe the external stimuli to which people are responding, nor does he ascertain whether they are the same for both

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Whorf 53
Hopi and English speakers . He referred to the subjective experiences of becoming later and later, of duration , etc. , but not to something external , and hence observable , which is the basis for this experience . This may be intrinsically more difficult for concepts such as time , but it deserves more direct attention: from what does the speaker derive the experience of duration or "becoming later" of which Whorf spoke? The problem is not inherently insoluble , and some of the kinds of external prompt which might enter the middle column have been indicated in the diagram : the recognition of similarity, of cyclic recurrence of some external events (e.g. , rise and set of the sun). (Noncyclic events could then be calibrated against cyclic ones to yield the experience of duration of any event. The limits of such a calibration - in the sense of fineness will depend on the available cross-linguistic possibilities. )
Likewise , although Whorf asserted a n influence o n habitual thought, he did not describe individual nonverbal behaviors to support his claims. He did cite other patterns in the language which suggest that the modes of thinking that he described are in fact present: for example , we would not say a length oftime if we did not have an "objectified" notion of time . However, it can be argued that these language patterns should be regarded as simply other parts of the overall "fashion of speaking" of the language which as a whole influences thought and that they do not provide independent evidence of the habitual thought pattern . Whorf's­ positivist critics have been particularly concerned with this point, arguing that reliance on more language data to confirm the existence of habitual thought patterns makes his whole argument circular.
There is some merit to these criticisms, although the evidence is not so weak and unpromising as it might appear. Although operationally nonlinguistic evidence of habitual thought might be more elegant and convincing . overtly verbal evidence should not be regarded as unusable indeed there may be some concepts for which verbal evidence is the only possible evidence . For such evidence to be usable , it must be a plausible but not a necessary semantic or structural derivative of the original linguistic structure . Whorf's example concerning the countability of days with cardinal numbers would not be acceptable independent evidence for the objectification in habitual thought of time , because we can fairly regard plurality and enumeration as necessarily linked in an overall system of grammatical number. Whorf's subsequent argument that our tense system grows out of the objectification of time (along with its spatialization) might be regarded as a non-necessary linkage and hence acceptable in this respect , although many would question its plausibility . Whorf's verbal evidence , then , is lacking , in these respects, but not all verbal evidence need be flawed in these ways . (See also the discussion of this issue by Carroll , 1956, pp . 29-30 . )

Further, these criticisms of Whorf's data fail to take into account other evidence that he did provide within the overall structure of his argument . First of all , note that he has already established the plausibility of real effects on individuals in his fire-causing examples. Thus, the later assumption of such effects is not gratuitous. When he shifts to more complex patterns , it is not at all obvious what specific individual behavior would give evidence of a general view of 'time' - although the possibility of individual behavioral evidence should not be ruled out. Second, he presented a series of five interrelated grammatical examples to show the way the patterns work together to provide a systematic, coherent, yet non-necessary construal of nature (i.e . , a fashion of speaking) . Refer­ ences along the way to habitual thought are designed more to help the reader understand clearly the nature of the implications of the linguistic categories for habitual thought than to prove the existence of such thought. At the end of the series of examples, he drew together the overall implications ( 1 956a, pp. 147-48) to make a unified statement about the probable habitual thought worlds of English (or European) and Hopi speakers as suggested by their language patterns. Concrete observable evidence for the reality and significance of the features of this habitual thought world is presented in the following two sections ( 1 956a, pp. 148-52, 152-56) , wherein he tried to show tangible cultural connec­ tions (or affinities) with the hypothesized patterns of thinking. These patterns of behavior in the culture both show the influence of habitual thought and also help confirm the underlying transfer of the linguistic pattern to thought more generally - something which is plausible given the fire-causing examples even though Whorf did not present data from individuals in this case . In short, Whorf made another shift in going from his fire-causing to his objectification examples: he substituted overall group belief, behavior, and institutions for direct evidence of indi­ vidually held concepts. One pattern of this cultural evidence will be described more fully further below after we examine one final, crucial aspect of Whorf's treatment of linguistic analogies.

Analogical structures
In the examples thus far discussed , we have been focusing on the role of a single linguistic analogy in bridging between or uniting distinct kinds of experience . In looking for nonlinguistic correlates, Whorf drew connec­ tions between cultural patterns and whole sets or structures of linguistic analogies. So, before turning to the nonlinguistic evidence Whorf provided , it will be worthwhile to examine how related analogies can fit together to form an analogical structure linking together diverse elements

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Whorf 55

of experience . The example used here illustrates, as well , how covert categories can play a role in linguistic analogy and happens, also , to concern a substantive domain that will be important in subsequent chapters and in the empirical case study reported in the companion work .
Whorf continued his discussion by examining the distinction between "individual" and "mass" nouns in English, a distinction more commonly referred to by others as the "count-mass distinction . " He described the
English pattern as follows:

We have two kinds of nouns denoting physical things : individual nouns . and mass nouns, e.g. , 'water, milk, wood , granite , sand , flour, meat . ' Individual nouns denote bodies with definite outlines : 'a tree , a stick , a man , a hill . ' Mass nouns denote homogeneous continua without implied boundaries . (1956a, p. 140)

The two kinds of nouns admit of different grammatical possibilities:33 mass nouns do not take plurals or the singular indefinite article , whereas individual nouns do (1956a, p. 140) . In other circumstances (e .g. , with definite articles) there is no overt indication of the presence of one type of noun as opposed to the other. We are thus j ustified in viewing the distinction as reflecting a covert category (one with rather commonly occurring reactances) , although Whorf did not himself label the category one way or the other.
Whorf noted that the distinction between individual and mass is more widely and uniformly drawn in English grammar than in the actual physical objects referred to :

Rather few natural occurrences present themselves as unbounded extents; 'air' of course , and often 'water, rain, snow , sand, rock , dirt , grass. ' We do not encounter 'butter, meat, cloth, iron , glass ,' or most "materials'.' in such kind of manifestation , but in bodies small or large with definite outlines.
(1956a , p. 141)

Thus, there are many circumstances in which the speaker is forced to make a grammatical distinction that would have little immediate corres­ pondence to external reality or that would be in contradiction with that reality. The language compensates for this deficiency :

[The distinction] is so inconvenient in a great many cases that we need some way

of individualizing the mass noun by further linguistic devices. This is partly done

by names of body types: 'stick of wood . piece of cloth. pane of glass, cake of

soap' ; also . and even more , by introducing names of containers though their

contents be the real issue : 'glass of water, cup of coffee, dish of food , bag of flour,

bottle of beer. '

(1956a, p. 141).

Thus, Whorf argued , the [covert] individual-mass distinction has given rise to, or necessitated, a secondary [overt] pattern in the language . (The overt pattern of "individualizing" is, incidentally , one "reactance" of the covert pattern of distinguishing individual and mass nouns.)

56 Language diversity and thought

Notice that two distinct kinds of experience - containers and body types - are brought together under a single grammatical pattern. As before , Whorf argued that this has consequences :

The formulas are very similar: individual noun plus a similar relator (English

'of). In the obvious case this relator denotes contents. In the inobvious one it

"suggests" contents. Hence the 'lumps , chunks, blocks , pieces,' etc. , seem to

contain something, a "stuff, " "substance , " or "matter" that answers to the

'water, ' 'coffee , ' or 'flour' in the container formulas.

(1956a , p. 141)

So the pattern "individual noun + of + mass noun" covers two meanings, one with a readily interpretable perceptible correlate , i.e . , a container and its contents , and another without such a correlate but which is interpreted in the same way . This parallels relatively closely the argument with perceptible and imaginary aggregates discussed above wherein the more concrete meaning influences the interpretation of the more abstract one . Thus "bodies" are thought of as being like containers that hold "contents" - substance or matter. Whorf concluded:

So . . . the philosophical "substance" and "matter" are also the naive idea; they

are instantly acceptable , "common sense . " It is so through linguistic habit. Our

language patterns often require us to name a physical thing by a binomial that

splits the reference into a formless item plus a form .

(1956a , p. 1 4 1 )

We have then , in this view , an everyday basis for these philosophical notions that are so common jn Western culture.
Whorf continued with an argument that this binomial pattern is extended to cover other nouns:

the pattern of individual and mass nouns , with the resulting binomial formula of

formless item plus form , is so general that it is implicit for all nouns, and hence

our very generalized formless items like 'substance , matter,' by which we can fill

out the binomial for an enormously wide range of nouns.

(1956a, p. 142)

Whorf was not explicit here about the nature of the grammatical bridge , but it appears to be simply categorization as a noun or a noun phrase . 34 He probably meant to restrict this argument to nouns referring to physical objects, since his next remarks indicate still another extension to nouns with more elusive referents :

But even these [very generalized formless items like 'substance , matter') are not quite generalized enough to take in our phase nouns. So for the phase nouns we have made a formless item , 'time' . . . Thus with our binomial formula we can say and think 'a moment of time, a second of time , a year of time.'
(1956a , pp. 14 1-42)

Here the container-like portion is a phase interval and the content-like portion is "time . " Thus , one part of our objectification of temporal

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Whorf 57
notions involves its inclusion in the general binomial pattern for physical object nouns.
Step by step Whorf has built up an analysis of a series of three interrelated analogies: body-type relator noun phrases are analogous to container-type relator noun phrases ; syntactically simple physical obj ect noun phrases, in turn, are analogous to these more syntactically complex physical obj ect noun phrases (= relator noun phrases - especially the body-type formulas) ; and phase noun phrases , finally , are analogous to physical object noun phrases. This nesting of interpretive analogies is clearer if we read Whorf's sequence in reverse : phase noun phrases are interpreted like physical object noun phrases, syntactically simple physical object noun phrases are interpreted, in turn , like syntactically complex physical object noun phrases, and syntactically complex physical obj ect noun phrases, finally , are interpreted like container-type relator noun phrases . Thus, phase nouns participate indirectly in the interpretive schema "container + contents. " We can diagram the interrelations among these analogies as in figure 4. Notice how the English material from figure 3 is now embedded as one component of the larger analogical structure: Form bridge 1 and Linguistic meanings l . That is, the Form bridge of 'cardinal number plus plural marking' is now covered by the term 'individual NP (plural) ,' indicating the kind of noun phrase which can take such a formal pattern . The Linguistic meanings grouped together by this formal equivalence are expressed as 'cycle (sequence)' and 'perceptible physical objects (aggregate) . ' By showing how the treatment of "time" in English as a homogeneously segmentable and measurable continuum is grounded in a very complex series of equivalence relations of grammatical forms , Whorf illustrated graphi­ cally the more general point that linguistic structures can link apparently diverse elements of experience together in a coherent and semantically potent way.
This example is extremely suggestive in a number of ways. First , it shows how, by serial or hierarchical grouping, a single linguistic analogy can spread its interpretive effect quite widely. Each element brought into an analogical structure thereby acquires many of the connotational values latent in the other parts of the structure . Thus, for example , when phase nouns expressing temporal duration are linked in to physical object nouns , they are not only "objectified ," but they are also seen as being composed of a form plus a formless item - which view of physical objects is itself derivative of two other analogical groupings. It is this drawing together of ultimately diverse elements of experience into a single "large-scale linguistic pattern" which led Whorf to talk about a "fashion of speaking" typical of a language . Reference to the Hopi comparison shows not only different individual units in some cases but a

completely different pattern of overall organization which yields a distinctively Hopi system of analogical connotation or interpretation.35
Second , a related factor of interest is the possibility that the direction of influence is systematic. If it could be shown more generally that the concrete member of a pair influenced the interpretation of the abstract member across a wide number of grammaticaP6 examples, it would allow

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Whorf 59
the introduction of an a priori prediction to the investigation of linguistic analogies. Another principle of analogical effect suggested by this example is that a complex member with each part having a concrete meaning will influence the interpretation of a simple member that also has a comparable concrete meaning.
Third , some of the categories of concern to Whorf in this example are covert (see the discussion of covert categories above) - for example, the difference between mass and individual nouns in English .37 This suggests the importance of examining these types of categories in any analysis of linguistic analogy. Although in this example, as Whorf developed it, the covert distinction serves the rather minor role of prompting the for­ mation of an overt category whose analogical grouping is the main focus of concern , there is no reason why covert categories should not have direct effect , as Whorf himself noted on occasion ( 1 956a, p. 69) . In fact , the example could be reanalyzed focusing on the analogical grouping of "genuine contents" and "imaginary contents" into mass-type nouns, which would place the covert categorization in a more central place in the argument . 38
Finally, the suggestion here that some portions of the grammar are compensating for unfortunate side effects of other categories in the grammar is important. On the one hand, it guarantees the Boasian premise that anything that can be said in one language can be said in any other (e .g. , "mass" nouns can be used in constructions so as to determine an "individuable" extension) , but, on the other hand, the need to employ additional grammatical apparatus . to get the job done also guarantees the Whorfian argument that the "sense" will not be the same (i . e . , the need to individualize some nouns and not others itself signals something about their meaningfulness) . Whorf's argument here (as elsewhere) could have profited from an illustration that the Hopi pattern (without a count-:-mass distinction) set up its own referential problems for the grammar to solve . Since any grammatical category is a compromise with reality, it must generate problematic consequences and only par­ tially appropriate solutions which in turn have their own consequences.
Behavioral effects of analogical structures
It is large-scale linguistic patterns that Whorf sought to link to cultural patterns and not , as many have assumed , each specific grammatical analogy. (And , in rejecting such local-level correspondences, Whorf remained within the main thrust of the Boas-Sapir position described in chapter 1 . ) At this point we have enough of his argument before us to be able to illustrate briefly the kind of cultural evidence that he developed.

60 Language diversity and thought

We will continue with the specific example involving the "objectifi­ cation" of time by English (or European) speakers . "Objectification" in the sense of treating phase nouns like nouns referring to physical obj ects with all that entails (e.g. , the conceptualization of time as a homo­ geneous or formless "substance") now joins with other patterns (not described here) to yield a characteristic view of time as composed of a linear array of formally equivalent discrete units (i.e. , like a row of identical objects) . From such a view, Whorf believed, arose many of our cultural patterns involving time . The discreteness of temporal units leads to a propensity for historicity (i. e . , taking a decentered or nonindexical view of events as discrete happenings rather than as artificially segmen­ ted from other events including the events of remembering, recording, or anticipating) and to a view that periods of time are somewhat like a series of equal containers to be filled as in keeping records as a function of fixed units of time . The formally equivalent nature of these discrete units is based on their representing equal portions of a homogeneous substance . It leads to a view that the units are in fact of equal value and hence the notion of the equivalent monetary value of time units as with rent , interest, depreciation , insurance , and time wages. Also related to this view of time are the attempts to measure time more precisely and to do things more quickly. Finally, the linearity of time allows us to project into the future by imagining an unending sequence of such formally equiv­ alent discrete units; hence our attention to the budgeting, programming, and scheduling of time and our view of time as monotonous with the attendant attitudes of complacency about future events (the future will be like the past) . Most of these are observable cultural practices, and in his discussion Whorf describes observable correlates of the few that are mentioned here as attitudes.
Hopi cultural patterns , by contrast , are quite different , and in ways that appear to relate to their linguistic treatment of time. Recall that in Hopi, cycles are treated like repeated visits of the "same man," hence

it is as if the return of the day were felt as the return of the same person, a little

older but with all the impresses of yesterday, not "another day," i.e. like an

entirely different person.

(1956a, p. 151)

With past events essentially "present" in the present , there is less incentive to be concerned with detailed recording of past events ; this is supported by a more general tendency not to regard events as discrete and well bounded (1956a, p. 153) . As a consequence, in Whorf's view, the Hopi fail to exhibit our tendency toward historicity. Conversely, one can act in the present to influence the future :

One does not alter several men by working upon j ust one , but one can prepare and so alter the later visits of the same man by working to affect the visit he is

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Whorf 6 1

making now. This is the way the Hopi deal with the future - by working within a

present situation which is expected to carry impresses. both obvious and occult ,

forward into tIle future event of interest .

(1956a, p. 148)

Whorf provided descriptions of a large number of observable correlates of this view in the form of various culturally distinctive activities of preparing: "announcing," inward and outward preparations for future events, and an emphasis in many activities on the cumulative value of persistent, incremental accumulations of effort and energy toward a goal . Note that these are not like our activities of budgeting and scheduling, but are activities in the immediate present with presumed future effect. Whorf described other practices which reflect a different view of time; and his original discussion of Hopi customs should be consulted (1956a, pp. 148-52) , as it is difficult to characterize them in a few lines here . The important thing for the present discussion is that he dealt with specific cultural practices that can be observed, that appear to flow naturally from the hypothesized underlying view of time , and that are distinctive from Western European practices.
Thus, there is no shortage of nonlinguistic evidence when we take Whorf's argument as a whole , and it is incorrect to label his argument circular. By connecting the language patterns to broad cultural patterns, Whorf undoubtedly intended to demonstrate more clearly the sig­ nificance he felt language had. However, the chain of reasoning from language pattern to cultural pattern is long and complex - long and complex enough to have escaped many readers entirely (hence the frequent claim that there is no nonlinguistic evidence) and to have left unconvinced some of those who in fact understood the argument. Thus, although the logic of his argument is sound, a certain degree of plausibility has been sacrificed in seeking to demonstrate significance . Whorf's case would be greatly strengthened in the eyes of many by either the demonstration of more immediate, if less dramatic, language and thought connections at the level of individual behavior or the presen­ tation of evidence from more languages and cultures showing the same associations among these particular grammatical and cultural patterns. And where he does present evidence of effects on individual behavior, the call could be for more rigor so as to establish the distinctive role of language . Although important, all these objections to Whorf's evidence are not ultimately crippling to his thesis since , in principle , better evidence can in fact be gathered. Given the programmatic nature of Whorf's work, such problems seem inevitable .

62 Language diversity and thought
Overvi�w of Whorf's empirical evidence
In short , then , Whorf's evidence for his theses consisted of a series of programmatic examples that show how linguistic analogies influence thought . Some of his examples are drawn from his experience as a fire inspector and show how individual speakers are led into fire-causing errors by drawing plausible (in the sense of grammatically founded) yet situationally inappropriate inferences from lexemes that have multiple meanings. Other examples are drawn from his comparative linguistic studies of Hopi and English . Finally, some of his examples suggest that linguistic analogies fit together into more complicated structures that ultimately unite large areas of experience both formally and , hence , interpretively. He showed how speakers are led to hold certain general concepts characteristic of their cultures as they follow out the impli­ cations of their grammatical patterns. In these latter examples, the nonlinguistic evidence is somewhat indirect and in need of finer control . Although these examples do not "prove" Whorf's theory , they do show some of the kinds of evidence that would be relevant to showing both that linguistic analogies are appropriated by (or in) cognition and what sorts of effects the appropriations generate.
Ultimately, Whorf succeeded in pointing the way toward the empirical study of the relationship between the large-scale linguistic patterns characteristic of various languages and the habitual thought worlds of speakers of those languages. It is ironic, given the general perception of Whorf's work , that one of his most important contributions may have been to bring actual empirical evidence to bear on the very old, Romantic notion of linguistic relativity. He shifted the concern from the isolated comparison of the category content of individual sentences to the meaningful significance of the interrelation of sets of grammatical categories with "habitual" or characteristic cultural patterns.
Summary
Whorf went well beyond Boas and Sapir by exploring the language and thought problem in considerable detail. He focused on the relationship between large-scale linguistic patterns in particular languages and the habitual concepts used by speakers of those languages in interpreting reality. Implicitly, Whorf developed a model of the mechanism by which language and thought interact. Linguistic analogies associated with the linguistic classification of experience both embody conventional compro­ mises necessary for speech and provide a locus for diverse meanings to interpenetrate and influence each other . These analogies are appro-

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Whorf 63
priated as guides in habitual cognitive activity such as the interpretation of external reality and result in the speaker having a linguistically conditioned habitual thought world that appears to be , but in fact is not , necessary. Whorf did not explain when or why such linguistic analogies are used in thought. Finally, he pointed the way toward the empirical study of these issues by presenting an array of programmatic examples. He shows, for example , how lexically based patterns influence individual behavior, how grammatically based patterns influence cultural belief and behavioral norms, and how such grammatically based patterns can join together into iarge-scale linguistic patterns with apparent internal reg­ ularity of analogical influence . In general , Whorf favored illustrations that were clear and suggestive of broad significance over those that might achieve greater control. Despite the fact that Whorf did not develop a full formal theory and systematic empirical evidence , his work represents the first significant moves in these directions.

Linguistic meaning, individual thought, and cultural pattern

Whorf broached again the possibility , rej ected on empirical grounds by both Boas and Sapir, that language patterns influence cultural patterns. 39 He asked in the second part of his original question :

Are there traceable affinities between (a) cultural and behavioral norms and (b)

large-scale linguistic patterns?

(1956a, p. 138)

Sensitive to the previous rejection of such connections , he appended the following parenthetical remark to his question :

I should be the last to pretend that there is anything so definite as "a correlation"

between culture and language , and especially between ethnological rubrics such

as 'agricultural , hunting, ' etc. , and linguistic ones like 'inflected ,' 'synthetic ,' or

'isolating. '

( 1 956a , pp. 138-39)

Thus, in line with Boas and Sapir (see especially Boas, 1966a [191 1 ] and Sapir, 1949f [ 1912] ) , Whorf both rejected the notion of a highly pre­ dictive relationship between individual features of languages and cul­ tures (as might be reflected in a "correlation" ) , and also rejected in particular those traditional attempts , associated with evolutionary views of culture , to relate a single very broad , general feature of the language with an equally broad , general characterization of the culture . In their place he substituted a theory of a looser, more indirect connection wherein language influences culture in some cases via its effect on the habitual thought world of speakers. Specific configurations in the grammar influence thought , which then in turn influences the develop­ ment over time of particular cultural institutions.

Figure 5 Structure of Whorf's argument linking language , the individual , and culture

Whorf sequenced his question and also his discussion so that he addressed first the problem of the importance of language for individual concepts. This was important for his argument since he then used the notion of an individual habitual thought world (the linguistically con­ ditioned "microcosm that each man carries about within himself" [1956a, p. 147]) as a mediating variable or level between language and the rest of culture. Thus, at the end of his series of grammatical examples, he pulled together the various linguistic analogies that he had described to characterize habitual thought patterns for English and Hopi speakers. He argued, as we have seen , that the use in thought of various linguistic analogies (or sets of such analogies) inclines speakers to the formation of some very generalized concepts such as the "objectified" time and the "form plus formless item" dichotomy characteristic of English speakers. It is these characteristic concepts which are relevant to cultural behavior patterns:

Our behavior, and that of the Hopi , can be seen to be coordinated in many ways

to the linguistically conditioned microcosm .

(1956a, p. 148)

Thus, it is this microcosm which is coordinated with behavior, and not the linguistic forms as such . We can diagram Whorf's argument as in figure 5. Only after establishing this linkage does Whorf continue with a discussion of the various cultural behavior patterns that he feels derive in part from these habitual thought world patterns. Some examples of the cultural features that he developed were presented in the discussion of Hopi and English views of time.
By the introduction of this intermediate level, Whorf was able to introduce meaning into the language and culture issue . It is not the existence of a particular form as such in language which gives rise to a particular pattern , or form , in culture . Rather, the use of language forms inevitably involves analogical groupings that entail meanings for speakers ; these meanings lead to behavior patterns consistent with them .

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Whorf 65

Aspects of linguistic form that have little or no apparent connection with meaning (e .g. , phonological structure , degree of inflection, etc . ) would be poor candidates for generating cultural effects in Whorf's framework , until and unless some meaning value could be established for them. Likewise , aspects of culture that are very general in nature (e .g. , "agricultural") are poor candidates as effects because of their potential for combining with so many meaning values; rather, more idiosyncratic cultural institutions with correspondingly more specifiable , restricted meanings fit better with Whorf's approach . In moving in this direction , Whorf implicitly discredited the notion of using a formal feature of language as an index of degree of cuitural advancement and maintained his Boasian credential as an opponent of simple-minded attempts to correlate linguistic and cultural types.
Whorf was careful throughout to use words like "affinity" and "coord­ inate" to characterize the nature of the connection between language and the rest of culture. This is because he did not want to assert a necessary causal relation. In part this was because the connection was indirect, i.e. , through the concepts held by the individual . A second factor , however, was the possibility that the language itself is responding to cultural pressures and that , therefore , any observed association might have the nonlinguistic. culture as its origin. Whorf acknowledged that language and culture undoubtedly influence each other, but then continued with an argument that when a language and culture are in long historical contact, it is probable that the language plays the larger role:

How does such a, network of language , culture , and behavior come about

historically? Which was first : the language patterns or the cultural norms? In

main they have groWn up together, constantly influencin'g each other. But in this

partnership the nature of the language is the factor that limits free plasticity and

rigidifies channels of development in the more autocratic way . This is so because

a language is a system , not just an assemblage of norms . Large systemic outlines can change to something really new only very slowly, while many other cultural

innovations are made with comparative quickness. Language thus represents the

mass mind : it is affected by inventions and innovations, but affected little and

slowly, whereas TO inventors and innovators it legislates with the decree

immediate .

( 1 956a , p. 1 56)

The implicit view of the nonlinguistic aspects of culture presented here , namely that they are a mere "assemblage of norms , " was already under strong attack within anthropology by the 1930s even as Whorf wrote. Clearly there are aspects of both language and culture that change quickly or slowly depending in part on how integral they are to pervasive systemic patterns. Nonetheless, many would still accept the view of the language as a relatively conservative element in culture on account of the degree of its interlocking systematicity and its formal completeness (in

66 Language diversity and thought
Sapir's sense) , and Whorf's argument, likewise , may still be taken seriously. In short, although Whorf did not rule out the possible influence of culture on language , he ascribed less significance to it. It is important also that his argument was restricted to languages and cultures in reasonably long historical association; he was not considering con­ ditions of relatively abrupt historical change which might break the pattern of connections. His argument was a conditional one. Notice, finally, that Whorf returned once more to the individual inventor or innovator even in this historical argument ; this reinforces the point that it is through individuals - or, more precisely, their habitual thought worlds - that language exerts pressure on the culture as a whole.4o
Whorf's final summary of his findings concerning the relation between language and culture brought these various points together with a special emphasis on the need for a broader focus on general patterns and their significance to people in the search for a traceable impact of language on culture:
As for our second question (p. 138) : There are connections but not correlations or diagnostic correspondences between cultural norms and linguistic patterns. Although it would be impossible to infer the existence of Crier Chiefs [a Hopi institution involving announcing, or preparative publicity, which he has dis­ cussed] from the lack of tenses in Hopi , or vice versa, there is a relation between a language and the rest of the culture of the society which uses it. There are cases where the "fashions of speaking" are closely integrated with the whole general culture , whether or not this be universally true , and there are connections within this integration, between the kind of linguistic analyses employed and various behavioral reactions and also the shapes taken by various cultural developments. Thus the importance o f Crier Chiefs does have a connection , not with tenseless­ ness itself, but with a system of thought in which categories different from our tenses are natural . These connections are to be found not so much by focusing attention on the typical rubrics of linguistic, ethnographic, or sociological description as by examining the culture and the language (always and only when the two have been together historically for a considerable time) as a whole in which concatenations that run across these departmental lines may be expected to exist , and, if they do exist, eventually to be discoverable by study.
(1956a , p. 159)
Thus, Whorf believed that there are cases in which there is a relation between language and culture which is discoverable through empirical study. But he advocated an approach involving close, detailed interpre­ tation of the right kind of case (e .g. , where there is long historical association) with an interdisciplinary perspective, rather than the more traditional superficial correlation of features framed within a single disciplinary perspective . He believed that the result of such studies would show language to be the more significant factor in what is essentially an interactive situation.

The linguistic relativity hypothesis: Whorf 67
General summary
Whorf advanced the arguments developed by Boas and Sapir regarding the linguistic analysis of experience . He showed that the classifications of experience implicit in each language were not limited to obvious and frequent overt categories but also involved a variety of covert categories marked only occasionally by patterns of morphosyntactic "reactance . " I n this way he was able to give explicit content to and to make investigable some of the more elusive features of formal coordination among grammatical categories first described by Sapir. He showed how such language categories analogically group diverse experiences , how these analogies interlock into complex structures to form a coherent interpretation of experience , and how these interpretations vary across languages. In all this he moved well beyond the comparison of isolated sentences from various languages to a consideration of the character­ istic meaning structure of the grammar as a whole . He also grappled with the problems of why speakers were unaware of these language patterns and of how to compare these diverse linguistic systems in an unbiased way.
In his consideration of the influence of languages on thought , Whorf developed , albeit implicitly , a model emphasizing the unwitting appro­ priation of linguistic analogies - both lexical and grammatical - in habitual everyday thought. Here again, he made more explicit and investigable ideas first suggested in a much more general way by Sapir; Whorf pinpointed precise ways in which linguistic categories could introduce language-specific aspects of meaning into the interpretation of experience and showed how these patterns could be traced in the grammar. He was also the first to seek clear-cut and distinct empirical evidence for the influence of language . The most important of his arguments involved constructing an interpretation of distinctive analo­ gical structures in two languages - Hopi and English - and postulating on the basis of this analysis a characteristic cognitive orientation which should characterize speakers of those languages. He then provided evidence for the presence of such cognitive orientations by describing specific , observable patterns of behavior in the two associated cultures. The crucial element of his argument is the emphasis on the importance of the transfer of elements of meaning within linguistic analogies for the individual interpretation of experience which , in turn , shapes specific cultural patterns of behavior. Whorf clearly rejected simple-minded correlations of the formal features of language with general cultural characteristics. He also emphasized that linguistic influences of the type he analyzed would only be operative in a context of long historical

68 Language diversity and thought
interaction between a language and other aspects of a culture . In short , Whorf not only transformed Sapir's preliminary statements about linguistic relativity into a specific and empirically investigable claim , but also provided the first evidence of the existence of the hypothesized effe ct s .

3 . Approaches in anthropological linguistics : typical ethnographic case studies
Introduction
The death of Sapir in 1939 and of Whorf in 1941 in combination with the Second World War created a brief hiatus in research . Interest was revived during the post-war period sparked in part by the appearance in 1949 of a collection of Sapir's writings (Mandelbaum , 1949) and the reprinting of four of Whorf's papers on the relation of language to thought (Trager, 1950 [ 1 949]) . Throughout the 1950s and into the early 1960s the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis was a subject of active concern for a broad range of scholars and played a crucial role in the growing recognition during this period of the importance of language in human psychological and social functioning. Despite this widespread interest , a comparatively small amount of actual empirical research was under­ taken. After this period , interest in the hypothesis waned with the advent of the transformational approach in linguistics with its presumptive nativism and universalism . Only within the last decade has interest in the hypothesis revived, so it is to this earlier period that we must look for much of what little empirical work exists.
Most research on the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis during this period was developed within the fields of anthropological linguistics and com­ parative psycholinguistics. Most of these studies take Whorf's formula­ tions as their point of departure whether they are building on his work or being critical of it. This chapter and the next review relevant empirical studies developed within anthropological linguistics; studies within com­ parative psycholinguistics are taken up in two subsequent chapters . This review emphasizes typical empirical approaches or thinking that has made an important theoretical or methodological contribution to a line of empirical work . In keeping with this focus, discussions, reviews , or reformulations not associated with empirical efforts will not be con­ sidered.
Although the studies conducted by anthropological linguistics on the
69

70 Language diversity and thought
linguistic relativity hypothesis cohere by virtue of their shared perspec­ tive and methods, they bear little relation to one another at the substantive or topical level and therefore do not form a cumulative tradition which can be readily characterized. In this chapter, therefore, the work of three figures - Dorothy D . Lee , Madeleine Mathiot , and Harry Hoijer - will be examined in detail and will serve to exemplify the guiding assumptions, practices, and critical problems characteristic of the discipline's earlier approach to the issues. In the next chapter, several of the more important later innovations within anthropological linguis­ tics will be discussed.
For the most part , anthropological linguists undertook linguistically oriented ethnographic case studies to address the ideas of Sapir and Whorf. These studies were typically concerned with the relation of a single language to an associated culture or cultural mode of thought . In principle, these studies involved a detailed examination of some aspect(s) of an exotic language and a relatively direct analysis of some nonlinguistic parallel(s) in the associated culture. In practice , the over­ whelming emphasis was on language materials , and nonlinguistic elements were either entirely absent or themselves essentially "linguis­ tic. " The principal positive feature of this tradition is its serious concern with complex language forms. Two striking deficiencies are the inade­ quate methodological control over linguistic and cultural materials and the use of language materials as "nonlinguistic" data.
Grammar as a direct reflection of culture: the work of Lee
Many studies in anthropology "read" cultural beliefs directly off linguis. tic forms and do not seek additional evidence for the cognitive or behavioral reality of those beliefs. Studies of this type typically presup­ pose a close linkage between language and thought with concern for establishing the nature and direction(s) of influence , that is , few of these studies are directly concerned with the linguistic relativity hypothesis as such. Nonetheless, work of this type is frequently interpreted as relevant to Whorf's ideas. Many studies could serve here as illustrations of this approach (see references to case histories in Hymes, 1964b , p. 150) , but the work of Dorothy D. Lee ( 1 959b [ 1 944]) is the best known and , though not explicitly built upon Whorf's work , has most often been associated with it.
Lee's project was to extract from language data , both structural and textual , the worldview characteristic of a culture . For these purposes, she regarded language as reflecting the accumulated perspective of the cultural group:

Anthropological linguistics: typical case studies 71

It has been said that a language will delineate and limit the logical concepts of the individual who speaks it. Conversely, a language is an organ for the expression of thought, of concepts and principles of classification . True enough, the thought of the individual must run along its grooves; but these grooves, themselves , are a heritage from individuals who laid them down in an unconscious effort to express their attitude toward the world . Grammar contains in crystallized form the accumulated and accumulating experience , the Weltanschauung of a people.
(Lee , 1938, p. 89) 1
Lee's most important studies in this vein, i.e. , those based on work with native speakers , involved the Wintu language spoken by Indians in northern California.
Lee focused on the grammatical categories associated with nominals and verbals. In the noun phrase she showed the central importance of a distinction between generic and particular, a distinction which differs from and cross-cuts our English categories of number (singular versus plural) and of definiteness (definite versus indefinite) (Lee, 1959b [ 1 944] ; also 1940a, 1944) . She also brought in evidence about the treatment of kin terms and possessives (Lee , 1959b [ 1 944] ; 1940b , 1959a [ 1 950] ) . In the verb phrase she analyzed the complex of categories used by speakers to indicate the evidential basis for their remarks and their attitude towards their assertions (Lee , 1959b [ 1 944] ; 1938) . Additional evidence is drawn from the patterns of word formation , semantic extension , and subject-predicate relations (Lee , 1959b [ 1 944] ) .
Based o n this detailed examination o f the Wintu language Lee argued for the existence of a consistent and characteristic cultural orientation to reality which is substantially different from our own . She describes the Wintu view as follows:
A basic tenet of the Wintu language , expressed both in nominal and verbal categories, is that reality - ultimate truth - exists irrespective of man . Man's experience actualizes this reality , but does not otherwise affect its being. Outside man's experience , this reality is unbounded , undifferentiated, timeless . . .

Man believes [reality) but does not know it. He refers to it in his speech but does

not assert it; he leaves it untouched by his senses, inviolate. Within his

experience, the reality assumes temporality and limits. As it impinges upon his

consciousness he imposes temporary shape upon it. Out of the undifferentiated

qualities and essences of the given reality , he individuates and particularizes ,

impressing himself diffidently and transiently , performing acts of will with

circumspection . Matter and relationships , essence , quality are all given. The

Wintu actualizes a given design endowing it with temporality and form through

his experience . But he neither creates nor changes; the design remains

immutable .

(Lee , 1959b [1944) , p. 121)

Lee gives a reasonably detailed explanation of how she has derived these conclusions from the specific linguistic forms she describes. Many of

72 Language diversity and thought
these analyses of individual categories are quite perceptive and, like those of Whorf, much ahead of their time in terms ofsubtlety of semantic analysis. However, the overall presentation is difficult to evaluate because her treatment of the grammatical forms is not systematic. Lee gives us her interpretation of the sense of a given category or morpheme , but without enough examples or details on the array of structural alternatives for us to evaluate independently whether her claims are j ustified .
For present purposes , the important point about this work is that it depends on strong, untested assumptions about the relation of language to thought. The only evidence presented by Lee ( 1959b [1944]) , beyond structural semantic analyses, are analyses of myths. Other noniinguistic "cultural" materials such as the concept of the self, kin relations, and the like are without exception derivative of linguistic analyses. In a related article on Wintu concepts of the self, Lee acknowledged as much:
The Wintu Indians of northern California have a conception ofthe self which is markedly different from our own . I have attempted to arrive at this conception through analysis of linguistic form and structure , as well as a consideration of biographical texts and recorded mythical material. My study is incomplete , since I have no other record of actual behavior. The ethnography of the Wintu as we have it, is an account of a dead and remembered culture . (1959a [1950) , p. 131)
Thus, the entire analysis depends on structural and textual analysis.

But it is j ust this relation which has never been established and which remains controversial . In the absence of an assessment of nonlinguistic corre­ lates, such a relation cannot be assumed to exist either in general or in particular. In short, studies of this sort beg the question at issue in the work of Sapir and Whorf of the relation of linguistic and nonlinguistic phenomena. Providing such nonlinguistic evidence is not a simple task, and presents recurring difficulties for all research on this problem.
Grammar a s language, vocabulary a s culture: the work of Mathiot
Other studies within anthropological linguistics which attempt to address the linguistic relativity issue directly recognize the importance , at least in principle, of generating some "nonlinguistic" data to contrast with the linguistic data . However , the "nonlinguistic" data often take a surpris­ ingly "linguistic" form . Many linguists during this period sought to split

73

structure and meaning. assigning structure to grammar and meaning to lexicon . Further, in this view. only grammatical structure was truly linguistic, while lexical content (including any order or structure in the lexicon) was essentially nonlinguistic, i . e . • had its origins in cognition or culture. Thus there are studies of the relationship between language and culture which devolve into an examination of the relationship between a grammatical structure (representing "language") and a lexical structure (representing "culture " ) , wherein the latter is frequently a folk taxo­ nomy derived by the methods of "ethnoscience. " These attempts consti­ tute particularly extreme cases of the lingua-centrism characteristic of this whole tradition.
As an example of this type of approach, we can take Madeleine Mathiot's ( 1 964 [ 1 962] ) contrast of two "linguistic" variables in Papago with various "cultural" correlates. The linguistic variables were ( 1 ) the grammatical category of nominal number (i.e . , singular, [simple] plural, and distributive [plural]) as indicated by morphological marking, and (2) the classes of quantifiable nouns (i . e . , mass aggregate , individual , and mixed) as indicated by grammatical co-occurrence relations with certain general modifiers of quantity and by reduplication .
Mathiot focused most of her attention on the quantifiable noun categories (i.e. , the second linguistic variable) . She tried a variety of methods to identify "cultural" correlates of this linguistic variable . Her first procedure consisted of simple inspection of the lexemes grouped by the grammatical patterning ; this yielded results in providing a unified "perceptual" group only for mass nouns. A second procedure catego­ rized the lexeme groups by an a priori (i . e . , non-Papago) framework ; but this did not produce interpretable results. Finally, a third procedure involving an elicitation of a folk taxonomy based on inclusion relation­ ships between lexemes as j udged by informant(s) yielded a general association between individual nouns and living things and aggregate nouns and plants - later refined into a [± animate] distinction . The taxonomy was established by using sentences as eliciting frames, which , as can be readily seen , simply revealed another kind of linguistic relation.
She then asked what the function of this latter individual/aggregate alternation had within each individual taxonomic category. After an examination of the referential correlates of the various nouns, she concluded that the individual/aggregate alternation subdivided the taxo­ nomy futher along "perceptual" criteria. So , she has shown that one way of subclassifying quantifiable nouns (by grammatical co-occurrence relations) correlates with another way of subclassifying these nouns (by lexical inclusion relationships) , and that the interaction of the two is associated with identifiable denotational regularities. Thus, the "lan­ guage and culture" issue has been reduced here to an issue of the

74

Language diversity and thought

denotational meanings associated with certain language internal corres­

pondences. The study remains entirely Iinguistic. 2

The portion of the study relating to grammatical number (i . e . , the first

linguistic variable) is brief but continues in the same vein. The analysis is

even more disconnected from nonlinguistic cultural data, since it eventu­

ally centers on a correlation between the "simple plural" versus

"distributed "any-noun"

plural" distinction opposition . In effect,

wthieth"twaonor"iginindaivl igdruaaml-mnoautinc"al

versus factors

have been intercorrelated.

In comparing the results of her two analyses , Mathiot was led to see an

overall Papago emphasis on perceptual (versus conceptual) criteria and

on gradual (versus binary) oppositions. But there is no articulated theory

or contrastive cultural evidence given to make these claims persuasive.

Mathiot considered these conclusions the least reliable aspect of her

study , but she felt that they were amenable to further research .

In subsequent work , Mathiot ( 1 967a , b ; 1969) retained the emphasis on

the distinctiveness of lexical and grammatical aspects of language,

although she increasingly tended to see them as jointly responsible for

semantic value . In expanding on her earlier study , Mathiot ( 1967a)

shifted her emphasis from tracing "affinities between language and

culture" generally to the uncovering of the "cognitive significance of the

aspect of language chosen for investigation ," which she viewed as one

aspect of culture, namely the worldview of a people. But this new

concept of "cognitive significance" is still essentially derived from an

analysis ofsemantics (here operationalized as relations of denotation and

connotation between linguistic sign and reality) without language­

independent evidence:

In the cognitive analysis of a given aspect of language , the semantic distinctive features of that aspect are the basis for inferring its cognitive content as follows: The cognitive content of a given aspect of language is ascertained by relating the semantic distinctive features of that aspect to the concept assumed to correspond to the aspect of reality that is reflected in the aspect of language under investigation . This concept is called the underlying concept.
The underlying concept relevant to a given aspect of language is postulated on the basis of an examination of the range of meaning pertaining to that aspect as revealed by the naming of units of the universe of data.
(Mathiot, 1967a, p" 201 )

S o the "cognitive" analysis (both i n theory and i n practice i n this study) is really a more refined analysis of meaning, and cognitive content becomes merely one level of meaning - presumably its more general, less structure-connected aspect .
Further, the development of this analysis depends on the crucial notion of "underlying concept" to which semantic features are related in

Anthropological linguistics: typical case studies

75

ascertaining cognitive content . Yet this crucial notion is "assumed" or "postulated" on the basis of "an examination" of the range of meaning of the linguistic forms at issue - a sort of intuitive semantics - which should be highly suspect given that exactly the issue in question is the possible relativity of such interpretations . So , despite the elaborate formal mechanics of her approach ,3 Mathiot never really moved beyond language-based judgments as to the nature of Papago cognition . She did not develop nonlinguistic evidence or a theory about the relation between linguistic and nonlinguistic perspectives on cognition either in this study or in subsequent ones (Mathiot, 1969) , where she more clearly acknowledged the need for such nonlinguistic evidence.

Thematic parallels between language and culture: the work of Hoijer
The best-known and most highly regarded empirical work on the language and thought problem within l;lnthropological linguistics through the 1 950s .was that of Harry Hoijer ( 1964b [ 1 948] ; 1 964a [ 1 95 1 ] ; 1 953 ; 1954) . He investigated the relation between certain grammatical cate­ gories in Navaho and general orientation was somewhat different , and we begin with a brief sketch of the intellectual context of his research .

Hoijer's view of the relation between language and culture

Hoij er's investigations of the relation between language and culture

occurred in the context of a broader concern with tracing patterns of

linguistic and cultural distribution in space (i.e. , geographically) or

change over time (i.e . , historically) . He differed from Whorf in that he

emphasized the integrated, systemic nature of culture and rejected the

view of culture pp. 555-56) . In

as an assemblage of traits this he was both reflecting

(a1n9d64abdv[a1n9c4i8n]g'

p. 457; a view

1953 , which

had become more widespread in American anthropology and which , as

we have seen, was present to some extent in Sapir's later work. Since he

also accepted the view that language was a system, the problem of the

relation of language to culture was that of the relation between two

systems. Hoijer's general view of this relation was that language was a

part of culture ( 1 964b [ 1 948] , p . 454 ; 1 953 , p . 554) .

Hoij er's view of culture as organized and integrated led to the view

that in assessing the relation between cultures either in space or in time,

one should focus on the covert core of the cultural system and not on

more superficial overt traits which were highly subj ect to borrowing

Language diversity and thought

( 1 964b [ 1 948] , pp. 455 and 457 ; 1953 , p. 567 ; also 1954 , p. 103) . Thus he

felt that the rate and extent of culture change was overestimated in

traditional studies (i .e . , culture was defined too narrowly by its formal

and overt features) , and also that , from this perspective , cultur.e area

divisions might be constructed somewhat differently . Later, he made a

similar argument about language (i.e . , that it is defined too narrowly) in

that language groups are defined by features (usually phonological)

which probably bear the least relation to the rest of culture (1953,

p. 566) .

In spite of these' views, however, Hoijer continued to accept the basic

premise that culture changed more rapidly than language. Thus, in

examining the relation between language change and culture change, he

looked to culture as the source of at least some linguistic change

(especially in his early, pre-1948, writings) . He was more explicit than

Whorf as to how this came about. Cultures changed , in his view, because

new needs took precedence over old habits. But once one aspect of the

culture changed, its very systemic nature assured that other parts of the

system , including language , could be affected (1964b [ 1 948] , p. 457) .

Hoijer traced the influence of culture change on language primarily

through semantics , which , in his early works, was restricted to vocabu­

lary items : the introduction of new terms , shifts in meaning of old terms ,

or combinations of old pp. 450-0-6) . However,

1953 ; these

vocabulary changes could eventually result in changes in the very system

of the language. In particular, he showed how new vocabulary patterns

might generate new phonetic environments and thus adjustments in the

. phonemic structure of the language ( 1964b [ 1 948] , pp. 460-61 ) . This was

another application of the principle that a change in one part of a system

will have consequences elsewhere in the system. In his later writings,

Hoijer specifically indicated that lexical , morphological , and syntactic

patterns are all related (1953 , p. 557) . An important corollary of this

argument was that a given cultural influence or change may have quite

different effects depending on the language system it comes into contact

with ( 1964b [ 1 948] , e.g. , p. 462) .

Hoijer's approach to Whorj's arguments
By 1950 Hoijer had become concerned with Whorf's specific approach to the problem of the interrelation of language and culture .4 Hoijer felt that

Anthropological linguistics: typical case studies

77

Whorf had understated the degree of this interrelation , and in a series of articles ( 1 964a [ 1 95 1 ] ; 1953 ; 1954) he sought to find more evidence for the sorts of connections Whorf had proposed and to place Whorf's work in the context of more general concerns within linguistic anthropology . Given his belief that other aspects of culture were j ust as systemic as language , he had to modify Whorf's approach . In his view both culture and language have a slowly changing, systemic, covert aspect and a more rapidly changing overt aspect , and the place to look for similarities was in the relation between the core systems.
Having rejected Whorf's argument that language must be the decisive factor in language and culture interaction because it was systematic while culture was not, Hoijer was led to seek other grounds for giving language a special place among the systems of culture. He settled on the argument that language was clearly unusual among the components of culture in that it contacted and interpenetrated every aspect of cultural life :
the dichotomy between linguistic systems and other systems i n the culture i s by no means so sharp as Whorf suggests . Not all nonlinguistic aspects of a culture are mere "assemblages of norms" ; there are some that are also structured, perhaps as rigidly so as language and possibly, therefore , as resistant to change . The important point of difference , as between other cultural systems and language , it seems to me , is not that language is the more rigidly systemic but that the linguistic system so clearly interpenetrates all other systems within the culture . This alone might account for its larger role , if it has that, in the limiting of "free plasticity" and the rigidifying of "channels of development . "(1953, pp . 566-67)
Unfortunately, this interesting suggestion that language plays a special role in culture because of its interpenetration of so many other systems within culture was not developed further by Hoijer.
Although Hoij er was somewhat more cautious than Whorf in assigning language a special role in shaping culture change , and although he made his argument for its significance on different grounds, he reached essentially the same conclusions. He emphasized, following Whorf, that language habits do not inescapably limit perceptions and thought, but rather direct perception and thinking into certain habitual channels:
It is, however, easy to exaggerate linguistic differences of this nature and the consequent barriers to intercultural understanding. No culture is wholly isolated, self-contained, and unique . There are important resemblances between all known cultures - resemblances that stem in part from diffusion (itself an evidence of successful intercultural communication) and in part from the fact that all cultures are built around biological, psychological, and social characteristics common to all mankind . The languages of human beings do not so much determine the perceptual and other faculties of their speakers vis-it-vis experi­ ence as they influence and direct these faculties into prescribed channels.
(1954, p. 94)

78

Language diversity and thought

Hoijer thus made explicit the wide range of factors which must be considered even as he draws much the same conclusion as Whorf regarding the influence of language .
He further made explicit something left unclear in Whorf's work , namely that language operates in tandem with other cultural forces to affect thought . For Hoijer, the metaphysics of a cultural group was critical and provided the linkage between language and other aspects of culture:

The fashions of speaking peculiar to a people , like other aspects of their culture ,

are indicative of a view of life , a metaphysics of their culture , compounded of

unquestioned, and mainly unstated, premises which define the nature 'of their

universe and man's position within it . . . It is this metaphysics , manifest to some

degree in all the patterns of a culture, that channelizes the perceptions and

thinking of those who participate in the culture and that predisposes them to

certain modes of observation and interpretation. The metaphysics, as well,

supplies the link between language as a cultural system and all other systems

found in the same culture.

( 1953 , p . 561)

We see here the explicit acceptance , at least in theory, of a notion akin to Whorf's microcosm mediating between various cultural subsystems . (Cf. Whorf, 1956a , p. 147 . ) Hoijer's overall goal then was to show that language as a structured subsystem had intimate relations with the core covert metaphysics observable in the cultural system at large .

Hoijer's empirical studies
Hoijer ( 1 964a [ 1 95 1 ] ) sought direct empirical evidence for language and cultural interrelations in a case study of Navaho linguistic categories and their relation to the Navaho thought world. Hoijer concentrated on two detailed examples. First, he outlined the general morphosyntax of the Navaho verb and attempted to show that there is a distinctive overall "emphasis" on reporting motion and its nature, direction, and status. Unfortunately , it is not clear that all of Hoijer's evidence really indicated attention to motion. For example , the most semantically neutral motion verbs in Navaho require detailed specification of the type of object-form which' is in motion . Rather than a finer specification of and attention to motion, this could be regarded as a finer specification of and attention to object-form . Similar problems of interpretation arise in the last of Hoijer's three pieces of evidence , wherein he argued that the use of an active verb in nominal function to describe an object suggests an emphasis on motion. Exactly the same pattern obtains for the static (i.e. , nonmotionful) neuter verbs, so the distinctions once more have more to do with the overall view of objects than with verbs of motion per se.

79

Further , the claim that Navaho verb categories are distinctive vis-a-vis a broHaodijsearmtphleenosfolaungghut apgaersailslenlsottoestthabislipshue'rdpoartteadll.emphasis on motion elsewhere in Navaho culture. He isolates two parallels: ( 1 ) the nomadic life style of the Navaho , and (2) the motion of culture heroes in myths as they seek to perfect or repair the dynamic flux of the universe . The j ump from emphasis on kinds or quality of motion (or sorts of objects in motion under my reinterpretation) to nomadism and j ourneys of culture heroes , which involves the fact or quantity of motion of a completely different kind , seems weakly motivated . Further, the myth data and their interpretation may be regarded as another form of linguistic data rather than a clearly nonlinguistic aspect of culture. There is no attempt to show that "motion" is a common or habitual focus of individual Navaho thought patterns in daily life or that it underlies a wide variety of specific Navaho cultural institutions.
Hymes (1961b, pp. 36, 41 ; 1964b, p. 149; 1966 [ 1 964] , p. 1 18) in his discussion of this research saw corroboration of Hoijer's assessment of the importance of motion in Navaho life in the work of other scholars, especially Reichard , Astrov , Landar, and Kluckhohn. This evidence also seems dubious. Reichard (1949) , like Hoijer, based her conclusions on linguistic data (especially the importance , broadly, of the verb in Navaho) , but noted that the pattern is characteristic of many Indian languages and hence is not distinctive of Navaho. Astrov (1950) also dealt exclusively with myths and their content ; while stating that the Navaho are somewhat extreme in comparison with other groups, she also noted that the themes she discusses are common in many other Indian tribes. Landar (1959) reviewed the evidence to that date on Navaho motionfulness in his own study of themes in four myths, but this review of the evidence (especially from psychologists Kaplan, Suci, and Osgood5) is both brief and somewhat inaccurate and so adds little to the discussion . Kluckhohn (1960) based his analysis on Hoijer's work and so also added nothing really new to the discussion. So the purported support identified by Hymes is also derived from myths or other lan­ guage analysis and tends to suggest the nondistinctiveness of the Navaho themes Hoijer identified . There are no strict nonlinguistic data of rele­ vance beyond the nomadic history of the Navaho people mentioned by Hoijer.
In his second example , Hoijer (1964a [195 1 ] ; also discussed in 1954) outlined another aspect of verb structure which he believed paralleled nonlinguistic culture . By analyzing the Navaho pattern of subject-goal relations wherein the verb theme object-class corresponds to the intran­ sitive subject and the transitive objecf> Hoijer concluded that Navaho speakers see movement and position as inherent in and specific to an

80 Language diversity and thought
object class and not spontaneously produced by an actor.7 In Hoijer's notional characterization:
the events are reported as if object-class positions and actions existed indepen­ dently and the so-called 'actors' merly [sic] hitched a ride on them.
(Hoijer, 1964a [ 1 95 1 ] , p. 148)
Implicit in Hoijer's interpretation was the view that concord is a sign of importance , and thus concord between verb and object of a transitive instead of with the subject of the transitive (i.e . , the underlying agent) implies the peripherality of that subject. Alternatively, the syntactic equation (in case marking) of the intransitive subject and transitive object for a given transitive/intransitive verb pair implies that the introduced transitive subject (again , the underlying agent) is not sig­ nificant , i .,e . , that they are uninvolved and "passive" in some sense . This interpretation may be correct , but it is equally likely that Hoijer's interpretation is grounded in his semantic intuitions as a speaker of English , that is, these are the interpretations that would be implied if such patterns occurred in English. It is another matter to show that this view is actively present for Navaho speakers, for whom these forms are routine . s
Hoijer's evidence that such a theme exists in Navaho culture comes from Kluckhohn and Leighton (1946) ,9 who argued that a basic premise of Navaho culture is that "Nature is more powerful than man . " The Navaho believe that they can control or influence nature but not master it . This evidence is unsatisfying because no concrete examples were given by Hoijer himself, and Kluckhohn and Leighton's interpretation was given simply as a summary observation and not illustrated, developed, or grounded in detail with empirical data. (See Kluckhohn and Leighton, 1946, pp. 227-28. ) While the <,lrgument itself is not implausible and is probably correct, the shortage of concrete illustrations, the possibility that Hoijer (along with Kluckhohn and Leighton) has substituted his own intuition for Navaho thought patterns, and the lack of argument that the grammatical pattern and the worldview in question are at all distinctively related certainly make for a weak case at best . In fact , Hymes (196 1b , p. 38) argues that the premise in question is widely held among American Indian groups and is not distinctive of Navaho.
Evaluation of Hoijer's work
Hoijer's writings are noteworthy for their accurate characterization of Whorf's original arguments, but his own empirical research does not meet the same standard. Most notably, the focus of his analysis is on

Anthropological linguistics: typical case studies

81

broad thematic parallels rather than on specific interlocking structures. For language , he identified a common theme (which may, in fact , reside largely in the eye of the beholder) of "motion" in several areas of the grammar, but his argument remains a mere statement about an "empha­ sis" rather than developing into a demonstration of how the one component of the grammar becomes a regimenting metaphor for the grammar more generally in the fashion of Wharf's analyses. For culture , the theme is established primarily by reference to the general remarks of ethnographers about patterns of Navaho culture , remarks which use words similar to those used to describe the grammatical theme. But again, there is the simple statement of theme with very little detailed description of how specific cultural institutions reveal the theme or how they interlock into a consistent system . Further, for both language and culture , the themes expressed are very broad and, as might be expected , do not appear to be distinctive of the Navaho. This focus on themes or emphases is all the more disappointing because of Hoijer's own emphasis in his theoretical discussions on the systematic nature of the core linguistic and cultural systems. His work thus exhibits a gap between his understanding of the issues and his theoretical aspirations on the one hand and his empirical product on the other.
Nonetheless, Hoijer's work does stand out in several respects. First , he correctly recognizes ( 1 953 , pp. 564-66) that Wharf's presentation of contrasting cultural behaviors is intended to demonstrate the reality of the hypothesized microcosms. His own effort to present similar non­ linguistic cultural evidence quite clearly stems from this understanding. Unfortunately, in the end , he provides substantially less empirical information than did Wharf about nonlinguistic aspects of culture and he relies more heavily on language-based data to develop what information is provided. For these reasons, his work is less satisfactory than Wharf's, even as it stands out among the other studies in this tradition in its accurate assessment of what serious empirical work would entail. 10
Second , Hoijer saw correctly that Sapir and Wharf dealt with structu­ ral differences between languages which had semantic import :
The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis , it is evident, includes in language both its structural and its semantic aspects. These are held to be inseparable , though it is obvious that we can and do study each more or less independently of the other. The structural aspect of language , which is that most easily analyzed and described, includes its phonology, morphology, and syntax, the numerous but limited frames into which utterances are cast . The semantic aspect consists of a self-contained system of meanings , inextricably bound to the structure but much more difficult to analyze and describe . Meanings , to reiterate , are not in actual fact separable from structure, nor are they, as some have maintained (notably Voegelin 1949: 36) , to be equated to the nonlinguistic culture .
(Hoij er, 1954, p. 95)

82 Language diversity and thought

Such structural-semantic patterns might involve organized lexical pat­ terns or grammatical categories:

Every language is made up of a large number of such structural-semantic

patterns , some of which pertain to lexical sets , as in the case of the Navaho and

English color terms, and others of which pertain to sets of grammatical

categories, such as the distinction between the singular and plural noun in

English .

(1954, p. 96)

These points needed emphasis because they stood in opposition to the widespread tendency in American linguistics at that time to separate the study of structure and meaning, to argue in effect that the study of structure without reference to meaning was the essential task of linguis­ tics and that the study of meaning belonged elsewhere. 11 Hoijer under­ stood that it was precisely the inseparability of structure and meaning12 that made structural differences problematic in Whorf's view.
Third , although Hoijer presented information in his own work on only a single case (one language and culture) rather than comparative material, he recognized the importance of comparative control in investi­ gating the language and thought problem. His contribution in this regard is taken up in the next chapter.

Summary
The most important characteristic of the case studies in this tradition is their overwhelming focus on language , what we might term a lingua­ centric approach to the problem of language and thought . The range of variation, illustrated by the three cases, ranges from complete lack of concern with providing cognitive or cultural data (Lee), to the use of language data to represent both the independent and the dependent variables , that is, both language and thought (or culture) (Mathiot) , to relatively weak attempts to provide nonlinguistic data (Hoijer) . In no case is the nonlinguistic portion of the study its strong point.
Even when psychological or cultural analyses are attempted , they tend to be deficient in important ways. The analysis of cultural "facts" or themes tends to be unsystematic and ad hoc. Other difficulties in this tradition stem from broader tendencies within anthropology such as the proclivity for focusing on single case studies , which makes it difficult to show that the description of a characteristic thought world is distinctive of the particular cultural and linguistic group. Finally, the tradition is characterized by a concern for cultural pattern rather than individual cognition. Although this follows Whorf's approach , it is subject to the same criticism, namely that such characterizations, developed directly

83

from linguistic or other cultural data, do not necessarily provide an adequate basis for characterizing (or "reading off") individual thought.
On the other hand , most of the important advances produced by this tradition stem from insights about how better to conceptualize and investigate language. These studies are marked by detailed analyses of the complex and multiple aspects of language form and meaning which must be considered in this kind of research. They are all the more remarkable , as a group, in that the serious examination of meaning was not characteristic of their era any more than it was during Whorf's day. The next section examines some of the advances which eventually developed within or were recognized by the anthropological linguistics tradition - advances which will be important in formulating a fresh
approach.

4. Approaches in anthropological linguistics : theoretical and methodological advances
Introduction
The previous chapter characterized direct empirical research on the linguistic relativity issue within anthropological linguistics. This chapter reviews later 'achievements within this tradition which have attempted to provide solutions or new perspectives on crucial theoretical and methodological problems in previous research. Although this work explicitly addresses Whorf's formulations, it has yet to give rise to direct empirical evaluations of the linguistic relativity issue itself. But the work does provide the foundation for such research by providing an improved understanding of the structure and functioning of the linguistic analysis of experience .
Advances have been made in three areas . First , more refined approaches to comparing the diversity of classifications across languages have emerged . This work both provides the foundation for a new empirical comparison and clarifies the way in which linguistic classifi­ cations are distinctively "linguistic" in nature. Second, the earlier interest in the diversity of linguistic classifications (structure) has been supplemented by an increasing emphasis on the diverse uses (functions) of language not only across language groups but even within a single language community. This work opens up an entirely new dimension of the relativity problem. Third, more specific content has been given to the notion that speakers have differential awareness of their various lan­ guage categories. This work illuminates the process by which language categories influence thought and , in conj unction with the work on the diverse uses of language , suggests another new dimension of the rela­ tivity problem.

Controlled comparison of structural diversity
We have seen that in his linguistic studies, Whorf went beyond a simple emphasis on the diversity of language classifications to emphasize the importance of comparative analysis and meaningful cross-language gen­ eralization . He attempted, in a variety of ways, to establish a frame of comparison for linguistic analysis which would be independent of the peculiarities of any given language. But most of these ideas were not specifically applied to his work on the relation of language to habitual thought. His comparison of the English (SAE) and Hopi cases was, of course , informed by his knowledge of the structure of a wide range of languages, but it actually hinged for the most part on detailed contrasts of the two languages; no broader comparative framework was introduced to show that the linguistic patterns or the habitual thought patterns were highly distinctive of the ·two groups. The various anthropological case studies reviewed in chapter 3 were even less comparative, typically focusing on the structure of a single language . Again , although these studies may have been informed by the analysts' knowledge of general linguistics, the absence of explicit comparison with any other language , let alone with an array of languages in a more broadly based comparative framework, constituted a singular weakness of these approaches in anthropological linguistics and a movement backwards from the standard set by Whorf's own work.
Attempts were made , however, beginning in the late 1950s to take the problem of controlled comparison more seriously. These attempts con­ verged with a general resurgence of interest during this same period in the identification of language universals and in the construction of linguistic typologies. Although these attempts have as yet had little substantive impact on research on the linguistic relativity problem , they provide essential tools for research in this area. No genuine progress can be made unless and until the differences among languages are given an adequate comparative characterization in specifically linguistic terms and these differences .are then related to cognitive or cultural differences which are also given adequate comparative characterization. In this section the two principal approaches to controlled comparison which were developed within the anthropological linguistics tradition will be reviewed. One approach sought to exploit patterns of regional distri­ bution of languages and cultures. Related languages spoken by divergent cultural groups and diverse languages spoken by similar cultural groups were identified as promising areas for controlled comparison of the relation of language and culture. A second approach involved using recently developed typological frameworks developed in the study of linguistic universals to build useful dimensions of comparison that could

o

86 Language diversity and thought
be applied to a large number of widely dispersed and genetically unrelated languages.

Regional approaches
Although he did not execute such a study, Hoijer explicitly emphasized the methodological need for controlled comparison to enable the drawing of sound conclusions on the language and culture question. He made the first proposal for a study which would provide such control using the Indian cultures of the US Southwest, where there are similar cultures (by traditional criteria) but diverse languages, and similar languages associated with diverse cultures (Hoijer, 1954, pp. 103-104) . Figure 6 shows in schematic form the relationships among the groups he suggested comparing. By studying these peoples , it would be possible both to study the relative importance of language as against other cultural factors in shaping a thought world and to question more directly the traditional construction of culture areas upon an evaluation of overt, yet peripheral , cultural traits. (Recall that this was a major part of Hoijer's own research agenda . ) In his discussion , Hoijer was not explicit about exactly how he would go about assessing the thought worlds of these various groups. Some indication of how he would have proceeded, however, is given by his own study of these issues among the Navaho, which was reviewed in chapter 3.
The Southwest Project in Comparative Psycholinguistics (Casagrande, 1956; 1960 ; Carroll , 1967) represented the first attempt to execute such a controlled comparison of six culture groups in the same general region , although the various groups were not as well counterbalanced for lan­ guage similarity as in Hoijer's original proposal. The cultures they studied are indicated in figure 7. Unfortunately , many of the results of these studies relevant to the language and thought (or language and culture)
