Preface
Aer hours and hours (and hours) of watching video recordings of interaction between children and parents, the signiﬁcation of bodies still remains mysterious to me in many ways. I continue to be amazed by how acts and movements simultaneously appear deeply familiar and “typical” on the one hand, open-ended in their meaning and slippery when it comes to their speciﬁcation on the other. e recognition of certain movements as meaningful, and somehow structured, obviously requires the intuitions of a “recognizer”. is holds not only for the participants in the interaction, but also for me, the researcher. I have been thoroughly delighted for having had the opportunity to experience ﬁrst-hand how the study of visible action also points inward, to my own ways of seeing such things in the mundane activities of daily life — the world otherwise taken for granted — as well as transforming this vision. Writing this thesis has been a wonderful challenge. I loved it!
I also got my ﬁrst gray hairs while writing it.
Acknowledgments
Jordan Zlatev, my supervisor, is always busy, but don’t be fooled! No matter how busy he is, he has always been available for discussing issues and commenting on dras — sometimes, when time has been short, even in the middle of the night! e scope of Jordan’s academic knowledge is remarkably broad, and there is no aspect of the nature of language and communication that escapes his interest — gesture included. I have learned a tremendous amount of interesting things from him. He has also introduced me to other, more concrete, aspects of the academic reality, such as editing books, organizing conferences, starting organizations (SALC), and much more. I am very grateful for all of these things. Jordan even helped carry heavy furniture when my family and I moved to a new house. I think that speaks for itself regarding the massive support I have received. I look forward to continue working with Jordan!

I wish to thank the senior researchers involved in the (now completed) SEDSU project (Stages in the Evolution and Development of Sign Use), as well as the current CCS project (Centre for Cognitive Semiotics) and the PSUII project (Intersubjectivity and Imitation as Precursors of Sign Use). Together you have provided an environment for stimulating research. In particular I want to thank Göran Sonesson, who introduced me to the inspiring world of semiotics with depth and clarity, and who has been very helpful in providing the funding required for my various positions in Lund. Among these senior researchers I thank also Peter Gärdenfors, Ingar Brinck, Sven Strömqvist, and of course Jordan Zlatev (again). Recently, Marianne Gullberg returned to Lund University, providing a very welcome and substantial addition to the gesture expertise here.
Joel Parthemore did a fantastic job in proof-reading many parts of the thesis in very short time. I am very grateful for that. Unfortunately time did not permit me to take all of his suggestions for changes into account, even though they were all very good. He should therefore not be blamed for the errorRrrsors that still remain. When it comes to statistical calculations, Joost van de Weijer’s advices has been very valuable. Victoria Johanson and Gilbert Ambrazaitis have been very helpful with all sorts of hints, tips, and information when it comes to the process of thesis writing in general. Frida Mårtensson helped me out during the last hectic hours of writing when there were simply too many diﬀerent things that needed to be done in too little time. e staﬀ at the Humanities Laboratory has been incredibly helpful in many ways.
When I started working on this thesis, I had immediate access to substantial amounts of video data that were already collected, transcribed, and systematized in various ways. For this, I am greatly indebted to Ulla Richthoﬀ, Sven Strömqvist, Åsa Wikström, Tom Sköld, and Jordan Zlatev. I hope this thesis does justice to their commendable idealism regarding the sharing of useful research data.
I would like to direct a personal thank you to Ulrika Nettelbladt, who has been a constant source of enthusiasm and encouragement throughout my thesis work. ree persons from my time at Linköping University have had a strong inﬂuence on my thinking: Per Linell, Richard Hirsch, and Oskar Lindwall.
In addition to all my colleagues at the Centre for Languages and Literature — it would simply be too much to list all of you here — I would like to thank a number of other people I have been in touch with during the past ﬁve years. Your assistance has included everything from collaborations, discussions, passing conversations, comments on manuscripts, answering questions, socializing at conferences and seminars, and so on:

those that I have forgotten.
I would like to make a special mention of Adam Kendon, whose outstanding work on gesture was the ﬁrst I came across when I ﬁrst started reading about gesture research a few years ago. It immediately made me helplessly interested in the nature of gesture. Approaching gestures in his particular ways, Kendon has produced an astonishing number of valuable analyses of gesture. I agree with Heath (1992, p. 705) when he writes that “despite Kendon’s generosity in attributing his methodological framework to the work of such scholars as Goﬀman, Scheﬂen, Birdwhistell, and others, his research reveals a unique analytic orientation to the study of social interaction”. Without Kendon’s work and publications, the ﬁeld of gesture studies would certainly not exist in the form it has today. In addition, I would like to take this occasion to thank Kendon for his encouraging comments on the occasions when we have met, for his constructive remarks on several of my writings, and not
iii

least for agreeing to be the opponent at the defense of this thesis. Finally, I express my deep gratitude to my parents Christina and Per for all their
love and support, both in recent times and in the past; and to my brother Johan and my two sisters Anna and Karin for always being there for me as well. To my daughter Alice and my wife Evelhin: nothing could be easier than loving the two of you!

Part I Setting the stage

e aim of this thesis
ere is a progression and change in the use of these gestures over time so that we cannot speak of gestures as a whole.
Erting & Volterra (1990, p. 299)
1.1 Formulation of the overall agenda
In a nutshell, this thesis aims at providing an account of the character of children’s gestures during the period between 18 and 30 months. “Gesture” is here taken to mean, as a ﬁrst approximation, those instances when the body works as an expressive medium through movement. e analysis is based on video recordings of ﬁve hearing-enabled Swedish children as they interact with their parents. Each child is recorded approximately once a month throughout the study period. e approach involves empirical analysis, in the form of detailed descriptions of particular situated occurrences and generalizing quantiﬁcations. It involves as well conceptual analysis, in the form of investigations of central concepts such as “gesture”, “communicative action”, “instrumental action” (i.e., practical action), “signs”, “conventionality”, and “intentionality”, along with the relations between them. Rather than identifying the term “gesture” with a single set of essential properties, a comparative semiotic approach is taken (e.g. Kendon, 2004, 2008), which serves to pinpoint and highlight both diﬀerences and similarities between diﬀerent kinds of gestural performances. is leads to a conception of various forms of gesture as a matter of family resemblance (Wittgenstein, 1953). Such a conception, one could argue, is not a vaguer understanding of gesture than more unitary and essentialist conceptions of the nature of gesture, but to the contrary, a more precise one.

is broad account of the character of children’s gestures during the period when language starts to “take oﬀ ” should be of interest, not only to researchers within the ﬁeld of gesture studies¹ but also, hopefully, to researchers from other ﬁelds for which the character of children’s gestures is relevant (e.g. developmental psychology, semiotics, linguistics, conversation/interaction analysis, neuroscience, anthropology, speech and language therapy, ethology, among others).² Even though it is impossible to cover all the relevant issues involved in specifying the character of children’s gestures, I still believe that it is worthwhile to frame the inquiry in this broad way, in order not to lose sight of the larger picture. Such an approach raises fundamental questions about which actions that are to be included (or not), leading one in turn to scrutinize the central concepts of “gesture”, “communicative action”, “instrumental action”, and so forth. Nevertheless, it is obviously necessary to be selective in the questions addressed and the analyses attempted. Consequently, the approach is an opportunistic one, whereby a number of phenomena of particular relevance are brought up and highlighted. Some of these relate speciﬁcally to the nature of children’s gesture, and some of them relate to the nature of gesture more generally.
e overarching questions or themes addressed by this thesis can, for the sake of clarity, be divided into those that primarily involve empirical analysis and those that primarily involve conceptual analysis, though the reason for addressing them in the ﬁrst place is of course because they are relevant, even indispensable, in relation to each other. e main empirical themes addressed are:

(E.1)

e repertoire: What sorts of gestural actions do the children perform?

What gestures are the children not performing?

(E.2)

Development: What are the changes in the gestural repertoire over time,

as the children grow older?

(E.3)

Multimodality: What is the character of the gestures’ organization in

¹e ﬁeld of gesture studies has emerged during the last 20–30 years. Pioneering eﬀorts by researchers such as Adam Kendon, David McNeill, Susan Goldin-Meadow, Virginia Volterra, Jürgen Streeck, Charles Goodwin and others have provided the foundation for a steadily growing interest
in gesture. e International Society for Gesture Studies (ISGS) was founded in 2002. Since then a number of ISGS conferences has been organized —- Austin 2002, Lyon 2005, Chicago 2007, Frank-
furt (an der Oder) 2010. A ﬁh one is planned for Lund 2012. Since 2001 there has been a journal named Gesture ( John Benjamins Publishing Company), edited by Adam Kendon.
²It is thus a prime target for the emerging ﬁeld of Cognitive Semiotics, which is aimed at “integrating methods and theories developed in the disciplines of cognitive science with methods and theories developed in semiotics and the humanities, with the ultimate aim of providing new in-
sights into the realm of human signiﬁcation and its manifestation in cultural practices.” (www. cognitivesemiotics.org)

concert with other semiotic resources, such as speech and objects in the world-at-hand, as part of a social activity? How do the gestures arrive at their meaning, due to factors such as gestural forms and the contextual embedding of the gesture?

e main conceptual themes addressed all concern the nature, and deﬁnitions, of gesture. is is tackled from three main points of view:

(C.1)

e lower limit of gesture: is concerns if and how to distinguish between those actions that have features that qualify them as gesture proper, and those actions that lack some or all of these features. is leads naturally on to investigations of the notion of intentionality, diﬀerent levels of communicative explicitness, and diﬀerent levels of semiotic complexity.

(C.2)

e upper limit of gesture: is concerns if and how to distinguish between those actions that are considered as gesture proper and those actions that are somehow too complex and language-like to be considered gesture. is leads into discussion of diﬀerent levels of conventionalization, as well as the notions of ritualization, imitation, and “combinations” (i.e., communicative acts with multiple components).

(C.3)

Factors contributing to the meaning of gestures: In order to disentangle some of the factors that contribute to gesture meaning, a number of issues are discussed, such as intersubjectivity and interpersonal understanding, gestalt properties of gesture, as well as the respective roles of form and context.

e empirical analysis was carried out with these conceptual questions in mind. At the same time, the formulation of these questions was, to a large extent, the result of grappling with the task of characterizing the gestural repertoires of children empirically.

1.2 Why this aim?
As the research questions in the previous section suggest, the analysis is primarily concerned with what-type questions. To put this another way, the thesis primarily

5

C 1: T    
concerns explanation in the sense of “make clear”.³ It is only to a lesser extent concerned with why-type questions (reasons and causal mechanisms), although they are discussed where appropriate. One basic motivation for this focus on what- rather than why-type questions is that I consider descriptive work to be of great value in and of itself. I should also point out that I use “description” in a wide sense here, referring both to empirically grounded speciﬁcations of phenomena, on the level of empirical analysis, and clariﬁcations and elaborations of the relevant concepts, on the level of conceptual analysis. e extent to which understanding may emerge through detailed descriptions of phenomena, along with considerations of the concepts needed to explicate these descriptions, is generally underrated.⁴ Descriptive analysis should therefore not be thought of as “mere description”, but rather as a source of understanding and insight in its own right (cf. Wittgenstein, 1953). Notwithstanding this, descriptive analysis is to some extent also a prerequisite to the possibility of asking the right why-type questions at a later stage. is need not be taken as the radical position that there must ﬁrst be a lengthy period of purely descriptive work, that only aer this should one be allowed to embark on theory building and hypothesis testing. However, it should be clear that description, in a broad sense, provides the foundation on which any theorizing can be built, and that the value of particular descriptive works may, at least in part, survive “paradigm shis” at the level of theoretical analysis.
Why study children’s gestures in the age range of 18 to 30 months speciﬁcally? Even though research on children’s gestures has gained serious momentum during the last decade or two, most of the work that has been done so far has been concerned with the period before the age range studied here. at is, previous research has mainly focused on the period when the ﬁrst intentional gestures appear, around the end of the ﬁrst year, when one ﬁnds the ﬁrst pointing gestures and some other social actions such as  and  (e.g. Bates et al., 1979; Volterra & Erting,
³From the Latin, explanare = to ‘make ﬂat’. ⁴It has always seemed to me that achieving consensus on the structure of the explanandum is far more pressing than achieving consensus on the vocabulary to use for the explanans. For example, there is endless debate in the human sciences whether there is a place for a “mentalistic” vocabulary of explanation or not, somewhat related to the question of whether there is a place for folkpsychological concepts in scientiﬁc explanations or not. To me, such debates seem to have surprisingly few consequences for the understanding of the explanandum itself, although they are oen presented as posing an either/or issue. e question of whether a “mentalistic” or “folk-psychological” vocabulary should be used in descriptions of the explanandum or not is an entirely diﬀerent issue, and here I would say that both approaches are possible in principle as well as mutually enriching. As long as speciﬁcations of the explanandum seems to survive tests of veriﬁcation, my position is that they should be considered science proper.

Beyond this point, the number of studies decreases, as illustrated in Figure 1.1. Figure 1.1 shows the age ranges for the 172 studies of children’s gestures that I have came across so far involving children between 0.5 and 3.5 years.⁵ e majority of research on in this sample of studies concerns the age range of 9 to 24 months (71.6% of the total), even though that is less than half the age range in the ﬁgure as a whole. e period studied in this thesis therefore begins at a time which has been studied by a relatively large proportion of researchers — which is useful, for purposes of comparison with other studies — then extends further in time than most research has done so far. Moreover, it should be noted that most of the studies included in the graph have concerned some speciﬁc aspect of children’s gestures rather than overall characterizations of the repertoire, which means that there are many aspects of the gestures of children between 18 and 30 months that remain largely unexplored (cf.
⁵e graph includes studies involving both children’s own gestures and gestures directed toward children. Since many studies include children of more than one age, single studies are oen represented in several of the bars in the graph. Even though the graph does not represent all the work that has been carried out in this area, it still gives a good idea of the overall situation. Some studies that I have come across are not included in this graph, such as studies on deaf children, children with autism or other special issues. Also excluded are articles that summarize or discuss other research without presenting results from any new study. Regarding biases in the sampling, it may be noted that there are many studies on early pointing in infants around 9–14 months and that I have been slightly less concerned in locating everything that has been written on that age range compared to studies of older children. is means that the true distribution of studies of children’s gestures in these ages is likely to be even more uneven, with an even larger proportion of studies focused on younger children, than what is shown in the ﬁgure.

Stefanini et al., 2009, p. 169): hence the aim of this thesis, both with respect to the focus on a descriptive approach and the focus on children between 18 and 30 months. One beneﬁt of the data, in addition to covering an age range that has been little studied, is that each child is recorded relatively oen. is makes it is possible to get a relatively detailed view of various developmental progressions — more so than in many other studies of this age range. Overall, there are also very few studies of gestures with Swedish children. In 1999 Berglund (1999, p. 23) stated that “Systematic research in early play or gestures of Swedish children is, to our knowledge, non-existent” — which was certainly correct at the time. A few more studies have appeared since then, but not many (Allwood & Ahlsén, 1999; Månsson, 2003; Berglund et al., 2005; Gerholm, 2007). Several of these are concerned with children younger than those studied in this thesis.
e period between 18 and 30 months is interesting in many ways. It is during this period that children begin to communicate by means of more complex spoken constructions. Since it is well known that gesture and speech are tightly coordinated in both adults (Kendon, 1980b, 2004; McNeill, 1985, 2005) and children (Volterra & Erting, 1990; Iverson & Goldin-Meadow, 1998), one may wonder what happens with gesture during this period of intense changes in the mode of speaking. Even though there are fewer studies of gesture in older children, as shown in Figure 1.1, that does not mean, of course, that the children’s use of gesture disappears; indeed, there are also a number of aspects of the use of gesture that emerge during this period, as this thesis will demonstrate.
1.3 Roadmap
e thesis is divided into three parts. e chapters in Part I (“Setting the stage”) deal ﬁrst and foremost with conceptual and terminological issues. Even though all of these considerations are motivated by the need for a conceptual apparatus to tackle the task of characterizing children’s gestures, many of the considerations in Part I are relevant to the nature of gesture more generally — not only with respect to children’s gestures. Chapter 2 addresses the question of whether, and how, to distinguish the actions that are to be considered gesture from those that are not. Instead of treating “gestuality” as a single property that may either be present or not in a given action, a range of diﬀerent properties are identiﬁed and elaborated on: all of these relate in some way to gestural qualities of action, including, among other things, diﬀerent levels of communicative explicitness, semiotic complexity,

and conventionalization, as well as diﬀerent kinds of intentionality. is relatively lengthy discussion leads to a multi-faceted conceptualization of gesture that opens up for comparisons, both in terms of similarities and diﬀerences, between gestures and various sorts of actions that many gesture researchers may not typically consider as gestures. Chapter 3 provides further conceptual investigations of the nature of action in social settings and of gestalt properties of gestures. ese considerations lay the foundations for the investigation, in later chapters, of the factors that contribute to gestural meaning. In last chapter of Part I, Chapter 4, various issues related to methodology are discussed and described: the data used for the analyses, transcription conventions, and quantitative measures. A gesture typology employed in diﬀerent ways throughout the thesis is presented. is typology is used both for purposes of quantiﬁcation and as a starting point for further analyses of a more qualitative kind.
All of the chapters in Part II (“Analysis”) are concerned with analysis of the data. Chapter 5 presents and discusses a relatively large number of longitudinal developmental patterns, from a quantitative point of view. en there are three chapters that deal, respectively, with deictic, iconic, and conventionalized aspects of the children’s gestures. ese are Chapter 6, 7, and 8. It should be pointed out that deictic, iconic, and conventionalized aspects are not treated as corresponding to separate gesture types. ey are instead treated as diﬀerent kinds of semiotic motivations that may co-exist in one and the same gesture. e three chapters on deictic, iconic, and conventionalized gestures are mainly qualitative in character, except Chapter 8 on conventionalized aspects of gesture, which also includes quantitative descriptions relating to the use of nodding and head-shakes at diﬀerent ages. e last chapter in Part II, Chapter 9, consists of an in-depth analysis of how manual handling of objects may take on communicative appearances in a range of diﬀerent ways.
Part III (“Rounding up”) is short compared to the ﬁrst two parts. It consists of a single concluding chapter, Chapter 10, where the overall empirical ﬁndings and conceptual developments are summarized. at chapter may also serve as a more extended roadmap for readers who want to do a more selective reading of the contents of this thesis.

”What is gesture?” and other conceptual preliminaries
My proposal could be called an elimination of theoretical terms, if you insist; for to deﬁne them is to show how to do without them. But it is better called a vindication of theoretical terms; for to deﬁne them is to show that there is no good reason to want to do without them. ey are no less fully interpreted and no less well understood than the old terms we had beforehand.
Lewis (1970, p. 427)
2.1 e idea of an upper and lower limit of gesture
To idealize matters, one might say that there are two main ways of conceiving of gesture. e ﬁrst is broad and inclusive: gesture as all sorts of bodily movements and symptoms, including facial expressions, gaze patterns, pointing, postures, just about any action made in a social setting (e.g. Rome-Flanders & Ricard, 1992), proxemics (interpersonal distances in social encounters, Hall, 1963), and in some accounts perhaps even blushing and being moved to tears. is broad view roughly corresponds to what is sometimes also referred to with the less fortunate term “body language”. Such conceptions of gesture have the beneﬁt of not excluding any potentially interesting phenomena from the research agenda, but they also have the drawback of failing to acknowledge quite real diﬀerences between various modes of expression. For that reason, this way of speaking of gesture will not be employed here.
11

C 2: ”W  ?”    
e second perspective is narrower and more constrained: gesture as those actions that are (or are perceived to be) performed under volitional control and that have publicly recognizable features marking them as being performed for purposes of expression rather than practical aims (Kendon, 2004, p. 15).¹ ese actions are commonly coordinated with speech (Kendon, 1972, 1980b; McNeill, 1985), although the speciﬁc ways in which this is done may vary (e.g. Kendon, 1985b, 2004) and the presence of speech is in no way obligatory. is narrower sense of the term gesture corresponds more closely to how it is used by most researchers within the ﬁeld of gesture studies. It reﬂects as well how the term is used in this thesis. Whenever gestures are performed as part of social discourse, rather than in “non-social” contexts (Rodríguez & Palacios, 2007; Rodríguez, 2009; Chu & Kita, 2008; Alibali & DiRusso, 1999)², they can be involved in utterance orchestrations in several diﬀerent ways, most saliently through:
• Establishing a referent (such as by pointing) or saying something about a referent by means of a “representational” gesture (Kendon, 2004; McNeill, 2005; Streeck, 2009b).
• Performing pragmatic functions directly, such as the speech-act-like functions of marking a multimodal utterance as a question or a proposal (Kendon, 2004; Streeck, 2009b), or other functions of providing interpretative frames of utterances.
• Regulating the interactive communicative process as such: for example in relation to turn taking (Duncan, 1972; Streeck, 1992; Bavelas et al., 1992), or to initiate repairs (Seo & Koshik, 2010).
• A combination of the above, perhaps also including other kinds of functions.
Since the narrower conception of gesture rests on the idea that not every action counts as a gestural expression, a number of distinctions are commonly employed to demarcate that which is gesture from that which is not. Most of these demarcations can be classiﬁed as concerning either what I call the lower limit or what I call the upper limit of gesture (see Figure 2.1).
¹Practical actions refers to actions such as driving a car, throwing away garbage, or opening a can of beer.
²I put “non-social” in scare quotes here, because, of course, even if a human being acts in relative isolation in a particular situation, she still may draw upon skills and abilities that have a social component as part of their genesis on an ontogenetic time-scale.

e lower limit separates those actions and behaviors typically considered to be gesture proper from those that are “too simple” to deserve the label. One class of actions or behaviors that is typically considered to belong below the lower limit is that of communicative behaviors that lack either some required degree of volition (such as blushing) or some required degree or kind of semiotic complexity (such as taking an object oﬀered by another person). at is to say, these are acts that do lack both overt and covert diﬀerentiation (Piaget, 1962 [1946]; Sonesson, 2007) between expression and referent/content. ey are labeled “simpler forms of body language” in the ﬁgure, for lack of a better term. Another class of actions that is typically placed below the lower limit is that of instrumental actions, which lack either some required form of communicative explicitness (such as not being intentionally communicative, either in a manifest and public sense Kendon, 2004, or psychologically Tomasello, 2008), or some required degree or kind of semiotic complexity.³ In research on child gestures, it is relatively common to talk of gesture in a way that implies the criteria of both explicit communicative status and a certain degree of semiotic complexity. at is, it is oen said that for something to be a gesture it must be both “symbolic” (in one of the many senses of this term) and involve or give some form of indication of a communicative intention, which may, for example, be considered to be present if a child engages in gaze alternation between the target of a pointing gesture and the interlocutor.
³Other movements that are typically not considered as gesture, but oen not classiﬁed as “practical action” either, are those involved in locomotion and sustaining posture.

C 2: ”W  ?”    
Many researchers also postulate an upper limit, which separates those actions or behaviors that are considered “too complex” and language-like to be called gesture from those that are not, in one way or another, language-like. e reasons for this are sometimes motivated by empirical ﬁndings, and sometimes motivated by theoretical distinctions. e prime example of bodily communicative action considered to belong above this upper limit is signed language, as it has the systematicity and complexity of a language proper (cf. Saussure, 1983 [1916]; Hockett, 1966; Zlatev, 2008b). ⁴ Even though the signs of signed language fulﬁll the positive criteria that are required for something to qualify as gesture, and even though both gestures and the signs of signed language are articulated by means of the same bodily medium, many researchers do not to consider signed language as gesture due to the presence of additional properties and constraints.
e beneﬁts and drawbacks of the more narrower conceptualization of gesture are the reverse of the broad conceptualization. at is, in the case of the narrower conceptualization, distinctions can be made between various types of expressive actions, which is clearly more satisfactory from a theoretical viewpoint than an undiﬀerentiated mass, but as a consequence of the contrast made with other forms of action, movement, or signiﬁcation, there is sometimes a tendency “to exaggerate diﬀerences and obscure areas of overlap”, as Kendon (2008, p. 348) has argued. Kendon’s argument is put forward in a discussion of what is here referred to as the upper limit, but the argument is equally valid with respect to the lower limit. Such exaggerations of diﬀerences between categories — simple non-gesture versus gesture versus signed language — without a corresponding focus on similarities, has, as I will argue, resulted in blind spots in gesture research. Gestures having properties typically associated with types of action and movement other than “gesture”, such as practical action or language, are much less studied (cf. Andrén, in press a; Kendon, 2008, p. 360). I will therefore try to follow Kendon’s recommendation to complement such an exclusive focus on diﬀerences between gestures and other forms of bodily expression with a more detailed “comparative semiotics of the utterance uses of visible bodily action” that “will be better able to articulate the similarities and diﬀerences between how kinesics is used, according to whether and how it is employed in relation to other communicative modalities such as speech” (ibid., p. 348, my italics).
e question of how to handle the upper and lower limits of gesture is clearly at the same time diﬃcult and central to understanding the nature of gesture. In Figure
⁴See the discussion on the upper limit in Section 2.3 for further elaborations on the upper limit.

2.1, the limits are drawn as two idealized lines, but as even the brief discussion so far has revealed, both subsume several diﬀerent distinctions. ese diﬀerent distinctions oen constitute separate dimensions that may vary with respect to each other so that they appear in diﬀerent conﬁgurations in diﬀerent actions. Put another way, the two “lines”, or limits, have internal structure, which means that they are not single lines aer all. Both can be unpacked and analyzed in more detail. Various conceptual issues involved in that unpacking occupy the rest of this chapter.
Issues relating to the upper and a lower limit also constitutes a thread that runs through the entire thesis, both on a conceptual level and as part of the empirical investigations, although it certainly not the only question that will be addressed. e aim is not primarily to critique shortcomings of previous research, but rather to contribute positively, by taking a few steps toward a systematic treatment of phenomena that have been less studied due to the aforementioned blind spots in gesture research.
2.2 Unpacking the lower limit
As stated in the previous section, the lower limit concerns the “line” between those actions and behaviors that are usually considered to be gesture proper and those that are too simple, in various ways, to qualify. e reasons for rejecting certain behaviors vary between researchers. Sometimes gesture is deﬁned in terms of the degree or kind of communicative explicitness involved. Acts with manifest features indicating some sort of communicative intention, may, but need not, be semiotically complex in the sense of being semiotic signs, with diﬀerentiation between expression and content/referent.⁵
On other occasions gesture is rather deﬁned as bodily movement with a certain degree or kind of semiotic complexity, that may, but need not, be used for purposes of communicative interaction with other persons. Indeed, it is well accepted that gestures may appear outside social encounters. Some examples of this are gestures in the context of individual problem solving (Chu & Kita, 2008) and pointing gestures in the context of counting objects, as a way to keep track (Saxe & Kaplan, 1981; Alibali & DiRusso, 1999; Graham, 1999). ere is also the notion of private gesture (Rodríguez & Palacios, 2007; Rodríguez, 2009), relating to the idea of private/inner speech (Vygotsky, 1962), which may be considered communicative in the sense of being a kind of “dialogue” with the self, but not in the sense of being a
⁵A more encompassing deﬁnition of a semiotic signs is provided in Section 2.2.3.
15

C 2: ”W  ?”    
part of a communicative encounter with another human being. In such cases, the issue is rather one of self-regulation through symbolization.
On yet other occasions gesture is talked about as those actions that are both explicitly communicative and semiotically complex. is is common in research on children’s gestures. Here, the focus is oen directed toward actions that are characterized by diﬀerentiation between expression and content/referent(s), and, in addition, it is commonly required that the actions be intentionally communicative in some way, as manifested through e.g. gaze alternation between the target of a pointing gesture and the interlocutor (e.g. Bates et al., 1979).
Finally, in some occasions, the reasons for considering something as gesture are simply not explicated, and the reader is le to rely on pre-theoretical intuitions of what will count as a gesture.
ere is also research on the relation between gesture and thought — considered either as two diﬀerent but related phenomena (Goldin-Meadow, 2003a), or as a kind of embodied thought itself (McNeill, 2005; Streeck, 2008b). However, as far as I know, there are no proposed deﬁnitions of gesture that pick up on issues related to thought speciﬁcally, such as, say, “gestures are those motor processes that serve function X in relation to thought”. Most authors thus seem to agree that an essential property of gestures is that they are publicly visible and recognizable (but see the notion of phantom gesture, Ramachandran & Blakeslee, 1998), and that gesture can be deﬁned on that basis.
What is implied by the phrases “communicative explicitness” and “semiotic complexity”? In Section 2.2.2 and 2.2.3 I elaborate on these phrases by classifying each into levels of increasing explicitness or complexity — beginning with simpler forms that most researchers would agree lie below the lower limit and ending with more complex forms that most researchers would agree lie above the lower limit. e classiﬁcations are formulated in ways that are relevant to the purposes of this thesis. ey are not intended as one-size-ﬁts-all constructs. Other analytical purposes may require other conceptualizations. e primary motivation behind the classiﬁcations is not to force reality into neat boxes, but rather the opposite: to account for more variants with ﬁner nuances than is usually the case whenever dichotomous distinctions are made between communicative and non-communicative, symbolic and non-symbolic, or gestural and non-gestural. More distinctions are always possible, but the granularity chosen here is considered suﬃcient for the purposes of this thesis.
It is worth pointing out from the outset that advocating clear conceptual distinc-
16

2.2. U   
tions should not be confused with claiming that reality necessarily corresponds to such conceptual distinctions in a clear-cut or non-problematic way. Whether, and to what extent, that is the case will always remain a question that is open for investigation. Still, multiple distinctions may be better than simplistic binary distinctions and certainly better than no distinctions at all, not least because a well-deﬁned conceptual apparatus makes more precise discussions possible, and deﬁning key terms does not require that the analysis itself be locked into these terms.
Before presenting the classiﬁcation of various levels of communicative explicitness and semiotic complexity, a number of clariﬁcations regarding the concept(s) of intentionality will be required to facilitate the subsequent discussion.
2.2.1 Intentionality
Aboutness and intent
ere are two main senses of the term “intentionality”, as it ﬁgures in various theoretical contexts. e ﬁrst of these is intentionality in the sense of aboutness (or directedness towards) (e.g. Searle, 1983). is is how Brentano (1995 [1874]) used the term in his famous “intentionality thesis”, as part of his project to create a descriptive psychology. Brentano’s intentionality thesis is the claim that “every mental phenomenon includes something in it as an object […]” (ibid., p. 88). For Brentano, intentionality is the distinctive mark of the mental, which separated mental phenomena from other kinds of entities. Diﬀerent traditions have picked up diﬀerent aspects of Brentano’s thesis. Analytic philosophers have sometimes treated it as a justiﬁcation for a Cartesian mind/body dualism, whereas phenomenologists, starting with Husserl, have rather used it as a starting point for the exploration and description of various modes of givenness of this “object” (Bartok, 2005). At least some of the phenomenological takes on aboutness are in line with various present day theories on embodiment, without any dualistic implications (Embree, 2004; see also Zlatev, 2009, p. 150).
e second main way that the term is used is in the goal-directed sense of intent (Condillac, 1971 [1756]; Bentham, 1907 [1780]; Anscombe, 1957; Grice, 1957), also related to the notion of volition (Maasen et al., 2003). is is how the term is used in most research on child gesture and children’s communicative development. For example, Tomasello (2008, p. 113) writes: “current theoretical debates about infant pointing and prelinguistic communication center on the question of whether the most accurate interpretation is a cognitively rich or a cognitively lean
17

C 2: ”W  ?”    
one”. e diﬀerences between the various theoretical positions in the debate that Tomasello refers to are typically phrased in terms of diﬀerences in the degree, kind, presence or non-presence of intentionality that is involved in children’s actions, in the sense of “having the intent to do X” or “attempting to do X”. Tomasello (2008, p. 15), who himself favors a rich interpretation, writes that “when communicators are attempting to inﬂuence the behavior or psychological states of recipients intentionally, we now have the starting point for communication from a psychological point of view” (italics added). e notion of intent may ﬁgure in several diﬀerent ways in the context of communicative actions. One may, for example, distinguish between intending to perform some action as such (action intent), and intending “for the other to attend to a referent” as a result of a performed action (referential intent, cf. Tomasello, 2008, p. 124), and intending for others to understand that I intend them to understand what I do (communicative intent). Communicative intent, understood from this point of view, amount to a kind of “second-order” intentionality, over and above the action intent(s) or referential intent(s) of an action (Grice, 1957; Sperber & Wilson, 1995 [1986]; Tomasello, 2008). Regarding action intent, one may further distinguish between intending the form of the action (serving wine in an elegant way), intending the immediate results of the action (getting wine into the glass, no matter who serves it or how), and intending more indirect consequences of the action (serving a good wine to make my guests feel comfortable, which in turn may make them want to come back on another occasion, which in turn may make my wife happy, and so on).
Being organized around some more or less speciﬁc intent is only one of several possible ways that something, such as an action, might be said to be about something. Intent and aboutness are therefore not necessarily entirely separate issues, but in any case, aboutness is clearly a much broader notion than intent (cf. Searle, 1983, p. 7). Whenever it is important to keep these two meanings of the word “intentionality” apart in the discussions that follow, the term aboutness will be used for the ﬁrst kind of intentionality, and the terms intent and intend will be used for the second. However, when the word intentionality itself is used, it should be remembered that it need not necessarily imply that an action is produced with a speciﬁc goal clearly in mind, only that the action has the general character of being about something.

First-, second-, and third-person intentionality
Another crucial distinction with respect to intentionality is to distinguish between three diﬀerent intentional perspectives, corresponding to some extent with the grammatical perspectives of I, thou, and anyone/everyone (the generalized other, Mead, 1934), respectively. is three-fold distinction is orthogonal with respect to the distinction between aboutness and intent, which is to say that both of them can be regarded from all of the three intentional perspectives. First-person intentionality refers to intentionality in the sense of the existential condition of mindful being itself, i.e. the intentionality (intent or aboutness) presupposed by the possibility of having experiences in the ﬁrst place. Second-person intentionality refers to the seeing of another person’s conduct as endowed with intentionality (intent or aboutness), and more speciﬁcally, perceiving that intentionality as, in some sense, belonging to this speciﬁc other unique person as a response to the present situation.⁶ What this means may be easier to explain aer considering third-person intentionality, which refers to the seeing of another person’s conduct as endowed with intentionality (intent or aboutness), and more speciﬁcally, that this intentionality of the observed conduct is perceived as being an action of the kind that “anyone” (in an idealized sense) would typically do in a given type of situation.⁷⁸ An example of seeing an action from the perspective of third-person intentionality is seeing someone put dough in the oven, and one perceives this as being done in order to bake bread or a cake, which is what “anyone” would typically intend by such an action (cf. Schutz, 1943), in appropriate contexts. An example of how the very same event could be seen from the viewpoint of second-person intentionality might be something less typical such as putting the dough in the oven and seeing this, not as being done in order to bake a cake or bread, but in order to hide the dough from the spouse who just came home, because the cake to be baked was intended as a surprise, not to be
⁶At the same time, no situation is strictly “unique”. Overarching schemata such as reaching towards objects, grabbing them, putting them away, and so forth, span across many or even most situations.
⁷Sometimes the term “third-person perspective” is used to refer to a more objective kind of perspective, as the perspective employed within the natural sciences, but this is not how the term is used in this thesis.
⁸e notion of typicality is also discussed in Section 2.3.3.

C 2: ”W  ?”    
seen before it was done.⁹ An important aspect of all of the three intentional perspectives is that they turn
back toward the self (cf. Mead, 1934; Schutz, 1953). In the case of ﬁrst-person intentionality this follows directly from the deﬁnition since it is already a property of the self.¹⁰ In the case of second- or third-person intentionality, this is perhaps less obvious. What it means is that when I perform an action, I might not just do it, but I may do it in a way that is sensitive to its status as a publicly recognizable action that is endowed with intentionality. at is, I might act in a way that is sensitive to the manner in which I am a “you” or an “anyone” to you. I might do it in a way that is not particularly typical, but is still perceivable as at least minimally rational, given the relevancies of a particular uniquely unfolding social situation (second-person intentionality). I might also perform an action in a more standardized and typiﬁed way, such as when I am acting like the typical sender of a letter (Schutz, 1953, pp. 19), doing all the steps that “anyone” would conventionally do when sending a letter (third-person intentionality), such as putting a stamp on the envelope, writing the address according to conventions, putting the letter in a mailbox, and so forth, all in order to ensure that my letter will be recognized by the staﬀ at the post oﬃce as a typical letter to be handled like any other. e ﬁrst-, second-, and third-person perspectives are obviously not mutually exclusive, but rather three co-present aspects of most social encounters.
Public intentionality
While ﬁrst-person intentionality need not be publicly recognizable in all respects, second- and third-person intentionality are publicly recognizable by deﬁnition. In fact, even when ﬁrst-person intentionality is somehow publicly recognizable through the way a person acts, it can only be so indirectly, in the form of second- or third-
⁹Describing ﬁrst- and second-person intentionality by means of ordinary language, the way I do here now, is inherently problematic, because ordinary language is itself a third-person typiﬁcation that consists of standardized elements — conventionalized words and grammatical patterns with conventionalized meanings — that “anyone” should understand (even more so in its written form, since the communication is then removed from the dynamic potential of the face-to-face encounter,cf. Linell, 1982; Schutz & Luckmann, 1973). at is, when describing the event of putting dough in the oven, or when I describe my feelings to you, by means of the conventionalized words of language or by means of conventionalized gestures, it is impossible to do so without invoking generalized third-person frames of reference, since the meaning of the words used are determined not only by the situation of here and now in its uniqueness, but also by their prior history of uses in a community — what “spouses” typically do, what “bakers” typically do, what “ovens” are typically used for, what “surprises” are typically like, and so forth.
¹⁰is is not to say that there may not be developmental processes of a social kind lurking behind the emergence of some aspects of ﬁrst-person intentionality.
20

2.2. U   
person intentionality, because I will always be a “you”, or an “anyone”, to you. Secondand third-person intentionality might therefore be referred to collectively as public intentionality. ere is no direct correspondence between ﬁrst-person intentionality and public intentionality. is can be seen if one considers that a movement which appeared to be unintended may in fact not be unintended, as in the case of deception (or that it was not about something from the point of view of the person who performs it). e opposite “dissociation” also holds — when an infant performs a movement of some sort, parents may well ascribe more/other intentionality to this movement than what is warranted (from a scientiﬁc point of view) purely due to the publicly visible ways in which the movement is performed.
To be sure, this is not to say that ﬁrst-person intentionality and public intentionality are so disparate as to be unrelated. In fact, most psychologically oriented research on gesture that treats gesture as a “window to the mind” (e.g. McNeill, 1992, 2005; Goldin-Meadow, 2000) rests on the assumption that gestures are typically more or less direct reﬂections of the content they seem to express, and, crucially, that this content is the same as the thought of the speaker. If this is taken to mean (A) that there must be some bodily process corresponding to the movements that a person is performing, then it is not controversial at all. I agree that some aspects of gestures may indeed be best understood as a kind of “thinking by hand”, as Streeck (2009b, pp. 151) puts it, in the sense that the situated movements and sensory activities of the hand may be considered an integral part of cognitive processes — that they need not only be seen as indirect reﬂections of thought that goes on “elsewhere” (ibid., p. 160). However, if “window to the mind” is taken to mean (B) that the ﬁrst-person intentionality and the public intentionality of (all) gestural performances are not just related, but that they are just two sides of the very same coin, then it is a lot more controversial. I do not want to contest that even studies that adopt B as a vantage point in the study of gesture can yield, and have yielded, interesting and reliable results, and that disregarding the diﬀerences between the intentional perspectives might therefore be defensible as a methodological heuristic.
Nonetheless, I do not subscribe to the idea of gesture as a “window to the mind” if it is taken to imply that persons always attend to their own as well as others’ gestures in the same, basically homogeneous and situation/activity-independent, way, and that all gestures therefore “reﬂect thought” — or rather meaning, as seen from diﬀerent intentional perspectives — in a single way. e degree to which all of the various forms of intentionality described here are part of gestural performances is quite variable, both from the point of view of the performer and from the point
21

C 2: ”W  ?”    
of view of other participants or bystanders. On some occasions, people hardly attend to their gestures at all, on other occasions, people attend to their gestures and the visibility of the gestures to the Other in very explicit ways (cf. Streeck, 2003; Streeck, 2009b, pp. 151; Gullberg & Holmqvist, 1999). Kendon (1985b, 2004) points out that people oen adjust their gestural performances to the (social) situations at hand, not least through the heterogeneous ways in which gesture and speech may be mutually adjusted to form multimodal utterances (see also Andrén, in press c).
e distinction between intentionality as a publicly recognizable aﬀair and as an existential condition of the ﬁrst-person perspective need not correspond to a distinction between processes that take place inside and outside the skin, nor does it correspond to a distinction between subjective and objective, because in both cases the action involved and its lived apprehension may be best understood as at once “mindful” and situated in the world-at-hand. Gilbert Ryle (1999 [1968]) made clear that observable conduct is not necessarily a matter of the behaviorist conception of action in terms of “physical” movements. For these purposes he oﬀered the useful distinction between thin descriptions (focusing on “physical” description movement) and thick descriptions (intentional, meaningful, and contextually embedded) of observable behavior.
Intentionality within the natural and the scientiﬁc attitude
Finally, one should distinguish between approaching public intentionality in action from within the natural attitude of everyday life and from within the scientiﬁc attitude (Husserl, 1983 [1913]; Schutz, 1932, 1945, 1953).¹¹ Jones & Zimmerman (2003, pp. 156-157) capture the character of approaching action within the natural attitude of daily life when they write: “we assume that the ‘default presupposition’ guiding social life is that the actions out of which interaction is constructed are designed to be what they appear to be, and in that sense, are intentional — unless accounted otherwise” (see also Heritage, 1984). Action understanding from within the natural attitude is thus characterized by a suspension of doubt “until further notice”. at is, participants in interaction normally do not doubt the intentionality (in both senses) of others’ actions unless there are some explicit reasons to do so.
Within research on children’s communication, oen guided by the logic of the scientiﬁc attitude, action and gesture is not always understood in this way. In this
¹¹While Schutz adopted the term “natural attitude” from Husserl, he also developed this concept in his own direction.
22

2.2. U   
context, the approach to children’s actions may sometimes instead be guided by the skeptic’s presupposition not to take any of children’s abilities on face value, unless a rigorous account can be given to motivate such an interpretation, perhaps on the basis of results from carefully controlled experimental studies (but see the concept of rich interpretation for a kind of middle road, Bloom, 1970). Action understanding from within the scientiﬁc attitude is guided by principled doubt, in direct contrast to the suspension of doubt within the natural attitude. Issues of judging whether a given act is intentional or not, or whether an action should be understood and treated as a communicative act or not, and so on, are by necessity quite diﬀerent when approached from within the the natural attitude and from within the scientiﬁc attitude.
Both modes of action understanding are obviously valid, in their own ways, but it should be noted that the habitat of human action is, aer all, within the natural attitude (Schutz, 1953, 1954). Even though scientiﬁc practices may legitimately strive to move away from intentionality-as-taken-for-granted in their explanations, they should not strive away from this sort of intentionality as a genuine property of the explanandum, i.e. the phenomenon to be explained.
2.2.2 Levels of communicative explicitness
“Communication” is a highly polysemous word (Zlatev, 2009). Even when its meaning is restricted, as it is here, to include only the use of various semiotic resources as part of face-to-face interaction between human beings, a great deal of diﬀerent conceptions still exist. Instead of making the case for a binary distinction between communicative and non-communicative actions, a classiﬁcation into four levels of communicative complexity will be presented below. e various levels may be said to form a progression from less explicit to more explicit communication.
e classiﬁcation is concerned with various kinds of communicative organization, from the point of view of publicly recognizable properties of movements, actions, and activities that give the actions their appearances as this or that sort of action. To clarify: in the case of an action that is performed so as to appear unintended, although it in fact was intended — an example of that is the well-known phenomenon of tackling diving in soccer (Morris & Lewis, 2010) — the aspects of this action that are relevant to the levels of communicative explicitness presented below are rather the publicly recognizable features that give rise to the public appearances of being “unintended” (assuming the deception was successful), on the level of second- and third-person intentionality, rather than the underlying and
23

C 2: ”W  ?”    
non-visible ﬁrst-person intent to deceive.¹² is is not to say that ﬁrst-person aspects of human cognition are unimportant, but the point is that what stays covert and therefore goes unnoticed by an interlocutor can hardly be argued to be a communicative phenomenon. is focus on public appearances is not necessarily to taking an observer’s perspective, since people may also orient to the public appearances of their own actions when they produce them (e.g. Alibali & Don, 2001; Lerner & Zimmerman, 2003). An action may, for example, be produced in such a way as to be publicly recognizable as an action of this or that sort, as discussed in the previous section on intentionality. e example of tackling diving in soccer games is a case in point, but more generally, and perhaps more typically, ﬁrst-person intentionality and second-/third-person intentionality need not diﬀer from each other the way they do in deception.
As stated above, the levels of communication to be presented below are intended to be focused on public appearances. e public appearances of actions that make up communication have two important properties: (A) participants in interaction have shared access to them, and (B) they constitute suﬃcient “evidence” for whatever sense (or non-sense) that participants make out of it, so that in one sense, there is nothing for the scientist to correct, or add to them, apart from uncovering and describing their role in communicative interaction.
Comm#1 — Communication as a side-eﬀect of co-presence
On a very basic level (Level 1), most or even all of the things that people do when they are in the presence of each other have a kind of implicit communicative value. is is captured in the axiom of the impossibility of not communicating when human beings are in the presence of each other (Watzlawick et al., 1967; see also the notion of unfocused interaction in Goﬀman, 1963, and and the notion of indication in Allwood, 1976, p. 66). Actions (i.e., action intentions) may well be understood in various ways by others even when they are not performed with any sort of visible orientation to an interlocutor. If I am having a glass of lemonade, someone might suddenly enter the room and notice that I am drinking. is may lead them to believe that I am probably thirsty, and if it happens on a hot day, they might think that this is the reason why I am drinking, and so on. ey might also be able to see more speciﬁc things in this action if they have access to more speciﬁc knowledge, for example if they know me well or if they happen to be experts on lemonades or similar.
¹²Of course, in the case that the deception is not successful, the act might have precisely the appearance of foul play.
24

2.2. U   
Even though my actions may be seen as comprehensible in various ways, both due to generic knowledge as well as more speciﬁc sources of knowledge like personal acquaintance or expertise, they may not be perceived and treated as communicative actions per se, neither by myself nor the observer.¹³
Already at this level, people may distinguish movements by other people that seem to be non-voluntary (stumbling on a stone and then falling, or the spasms of an epileptic seizure) from those that appear voluntary (scratching one’s back or picking something up in order to use it). While the actions of A may result in some forms of actions on behalf of B as a result of the actions of A, this is still not a matter of communication as an organized activity. Indeed, this type of action understanding is not what most people think of when they think of communication, and the communication at this level is at best an indirect kind, emerging as a by-product of mere co-presence of beings capable of intentional interpretation. Still, it is worth pointing out that any action, including explicitly communicative actions, may have communicative consequences that are not anticipated or expected — hence not strictly speaking part of the communicative organization of an activity — so, in one sense, aspects of this level are always present whenever people come together.
Comm#2 — Action framed by mutual attunement
A ﬁrst step in establishing a communicative encounter is typically the achievement of a mutual attunement between at least two persons. Accordingly, at the level of Comm#2 actions, there is other-orientation in the sense that a mutual attunement is established between at least two participants. en an action occurs during this mutual attunement, but the act itself is not of a kind that makes it publicly recognizable as a speciﬁcally communicative action. e participants may be turned toward each other and engaged in coordinated gaze patterns, and so forth. On this level the actions are surrounded by an interpersonal engagement in a negotiated interactive formation (cf. F-formations, Kendon, 1990; Ciolek & Kendon, 1980) — a kind of focused interaction (Goﬀman, 1963) characterized by the presence of a we-relationship (Schutz, 1951, 1953, 1955). is we-relationship and its manifest establishment in activity is a more basic form of intersubjectivity than the achievement of shared understandings, but it is nevertheless a kind of intersubjectivity (cf. Duranti, 2010). Even though mutual attunement may be established through
¹³Obviously there are cases where drinking is indeed done in a stronger communicative sense, such as when demonstrating how Elvis Presley used to drink, or when demonstrating the generic act of drinking. at is not the sort of drinking that is at issue in relation to Level 1.
25

C 2: ”W  ?”    
means recognized as communicative, a given action that is performed once such a mutual attunement has been established does not need to be publicly recognizable as a communicative act. It is precisely such actions, or aspects of action, that belong on this level.
Nevertheless, this does not mean that there will be no other-orientation involved in the action, it only means that this other-orientation will not be visible as such. An example of this may be when I am interacting with someone and then I suddenly look brieﬂy at my watch. I may do this either to indicate that I am in a hurry, even though I may already know very well what time it is, or I may do it because I genuinely wonder what time it is, or it may be something like a habit. Such actions may not have any visible properties to indicate to the Other that a given act was produced as an explicit part of the communicative organization of the encounter, i.e., for the sake of communication. However, this lack of a visible communicative intent notwithstanding, that an action is part of a focused interaction may in itself provide enough motivation for the Other to respond to it: in the case of the watch, to say “oh! I see you’re in a hurry!”, or to the publicly recognizable fact of the woman’s sore throat, to say “hope your throat gets better soon!”. Already at this level there can be a kind of indirect reciprocity, such that an action that is part of a focused encounter may be treated as intersubjectively shared and “answerable” despite the lack of manifest properties of communicative intent in the performance of the act itself.
Also belonging to this level are cases where someone acts in order to evoke a stylized presentation of the self “as one really is” (Goﬀman, 1959, 1971; Habermas, 1991 [1981], p. 86), at least when they take the form of an implicit self-presentation that is not designed to be seen as such, such as taking on a certain facial expression that looks good in the mirror. Such a controlled dissociation between “hidden” and public motives in the organization of an action may in fact be a more cognitively demanding feat than some of the other acts that would belong on this and the next level to be presented below (cf. Tomasello, 2008, p. 90) because it requires quite strong awareness of the self as visible to others. However, as pointed out above, this classiﬁcation is primarily concerned with various forms of public appearances of actions, irrespectively of their cognitive demands.
Comm#3 — Visibly other-oriented action
At the level of Comm#3 actions, there is other-orientation in a stronger sense: not just in the sense that the act may be other-oriented in its organization (albeit not vis-
26

2.2. U   
ibly so), but in the sense that the act is now produced in a way that makes it publicly recognizable as an other-oriented act made for the purposes of expression. at is, Comm#3 actions are structured in ways that may be characterized by secondorder Gricean communicative intent — the communicating person “must intend to induce by x a belief in an audience, and he must also intend his utterance to be recognized as so intended” (Grice, 1957, p. 383). In accordance with Kendon (2004, p. 15), and in accordance with the distinction made in the Section 2.2.1 between intentionality in a psychological sense and intentionality in the sense of publicly recognizable properties of action, it should also be pointed out that such Gricean intentions cannot be magically known to others. From a communicative point of view the crucial issue is how various actions may posses more or fewer of various features of publicly manifest deliberate expressiveness (relative to their context of occurrence), either in the form of a manifest orientation to second or third-person intentionality, or both. When restricting this argument to communicative actions as articulated by visible bodily movements and conﬁgurations, this does, in fact, correspond to how Kendon deﬁnes gesture (ibid., p. 15):
‘Gesture’ we suggest, then, is a label for actions that have the features of manifest deliberate expressiveness. ey are those actions or those aspects of another’s actions that, having these features, tend to be directly perceived as being under the guidance of the observed person’s voluntary control and being done for the purposes of expression rather than in the service of some practical aim.
In contrast to Comm#2 actions, the publicly recognizable character of the otherorientedness of Comm#3 actions makes them mutually manifest as communicative (cf. Sperber & Wilson, 1995 [1986]). For this reason, such actions are of a kind that people are normally held responsible for qua communicative actions and the act is therefore typically seen as a “ ‘move’, ‘turn’, or ‘contribution’ ” in the communicative interaction (Kendon, 2004, p. 7). When the term “communicative action” is used in a non-speciﬁed way in this thesis, it refers to actions that qualify as Comm#3 action.
Comm#4 — Reciprocated action
at an action is perceivable as a Comm#3 action typically also makes responses to this action conditionally relevant (although not necessarily in all types of activities, cf. Linell, 2009, p. 185; Corrin et al., 2001, p. 204). e conditional relevance projected by Comm#3 action is stronger than in the case of Comm#1 and Comm#2
27

C 2: ”W  ?”    
action, precisely because of the explicitly communicative character of Comm#3 actions. At the level of Comm#4 the status of the act as communicative is not just mutually manifest in the manner of Comm#3 actions, but now the act of A is responded to by B in a way that is sensitive to the conditional relevance of the initial Comm#3 action.¹⁴ In the words of Schutz & Luckmann (1989, p. 71):¹⁵
Social action can be either [unilateral] or [reciprocal], although in concrete cases the boundaries may not be clearly recognizable. At any rate, an action that the other person toward whom the project was directed does not “answer” is unilateral; only when it is answerable can one speak of reciprocity.
At this level, actions are not merely seen as communicative acts, but rather manifestly treated as communicative acts by means of responses that orient to the conditional relevance of these acts (including the special case of situations where nonaction is the appropriate response). In line with the conceptions of language and human activity of dialogism (Linell, 1998, 2009), one may point out that without any sort of response from B to an initial action by A, the action of A is generally incomplete from a social point of view. An example is when someone raises his hand to greet a fellow man, but receives no response whatsoever. Responses serve minimally to acknowledge the very occurrence of a prior action, but they generally also provide some evidence of how B has understood A’s contribution (Sacks et al., 1974, p. 728). B’s subsequent contribution is simultaneously a response to A’s initial turn as well as a new initiative in its own right, which means, more generally, that every utterance is at the same time potentially both a response and an initiative (Linell & Gustavsson, 1987). at is to say, B’s contribution is both context-shaped and context-shaping (Heritage, 1984), or formulated diﬀerently, it is made with respect both to future-oriented “in-order-to” motives and with respect to past-oriented “because-of ” motives (Schutz, 1951, p. 163; Linell, 1998, p. 166). It should also be added that “A’s and B’s actions are sometimes, in a sense, more of analytically distinct aspects of the interaction than sequentially separable units” (Linell, 1998, p. 167). Indeed, a response might be anything from an elaborate line of reasoning, or an entire story, to rather minimal and somewhat implicit
¹⁴is is not to say that the Comm#3 level is required for various less explicit forms of interaction between persons. It is certainly possible to respond in various ways to less strongly communicative acts of other persons, as already pointed out in the discussion of Comm#1 and Comm#2 actions. Reciprocal processes in a more general sense are therefore not restricted to Comm#3 actions.
¹⁵is book was ﬁnished by omas Luckmann long aer Schutz’ death. It is based on manuscripts written by Schutz from 1958 up to his death in 1959.
28

2.2. U   
acknowledgments embedded in the performance of some act that primarily serves other purposes. B’s response may follow A’s initial action, or it may be initiated during the very performance of A’s initial action, as in the case of one’s head nodding in agreement. In some highly routinized activities, responses need not even be overt, but they can sometimes simply be taken for granted unless indications are given to the contrary (“silent conﬁrmation”). It might be argued that, in such cases, the routinized and predictable character of the interaction itself stands in for the functions that would, under other conditions, have resulted from an overt response (Linell, 2009, p. 185; Andrén, Sanne & Linell, 2010).
A yet stronger form of reciprocity occurs when B not only responds in a way that is sensitive to the conditional relevance of A’s utterance, but A responds to B’s response in a further turn, making manifest that A has recognized B’s response and to some extent also how A has understood B’s response. A hypothetical example might go like this: First A says something (A:“What kind of bird is that+ ?”). B responds (B:“I think it is a swan.”). Finally A responds to the response from B (A:“I see+”). It might be argued that it is ﬁrst at this point of mutual reciprocation that the reciprocity of A’s initial action has come full circle (Mead, 1934; Linell, 1998, p. 167), not just as a manifestly noticed occurrence (by B) but as a contribution whose meaning has been jointly conﬁrmed in a mutually manifest way. Of course, there are all kinds of particular cases and variations on the relatively idealized example involving “A” and “B”, as presented here. For instance, the organization may be quite diﬀerent in multi-party interactions, and if it is already the case that the responding turn of B can sometimes be omitted, as mentioned above, this is even more true for A’s response to B’s response to A’s initial action.
One could also continue to postulate even more levels of communicative organization at yet higher levels, such as the joint achievement of topical cohesion across many turns of interaction, communicative projects (Linell, 1998, 2009; Schutz, 1951), and so forth, but the distinctions oﬀered here are the ones that are of most direct signiﬁcance to the analytical scope of this thesis. Whenever more precise elaborations are required, they will be oﬀered.
e way Comm#4 actions are deﬁned moves the focus away from A’s initial action, but the processes of reciprocity described here may still legitimately be seen as part of A’s initial action in the sense that they take part in the mutual determination of the communicative signiﬁcance of this act with respect to intent or aboutness (i.e., “negotiation”). Such processes of reciprocity may even serve to establish whether or not an act was communicative at all, such as when A makes a sound of clearing the throat and B responds by asking “Did you just say something to me?”,

to which A may respond “no, I was just clearing my throat. I think I had too much candy.” or “Well, I was going to say that…” or “Yes, I didn’t really like what you said before” (before A’s “initial” turn). All of these alternative determinations may serve to establish what the initial action “really was”, aer its actual occurrence.
Finally, it should be pointed out that a given action may, and typically ill, contain elements from several levels of communication at once and a single multimodal utterance may well be communicative at all the levels proposed here. An action can also be seen as a communicative act at Level Comm#3, without necessarily being interpretable in terms of its action intention on Level Comm#1. at is, B may only be able to tell that “person A clearly just performed a communicative action of some kind, but I do not know what it means”.
2.2.3 Levels of semiotic complexity
Gesture researchers, especially in research on children’s gestures, frequently make a distinction between “symbolic” gestures and those that are “non-symbolic”, even though diﬀerent researchers diﬀer quite radically in what exactly they mean when they make this distinction. In this section, a number of semiotic distinctions will be presented that are related to diﬀerent kinds of semiotic structures of visible bodily actions, which may help to disentangle various senses of words such as “symbolic”, “signs”, and so forth, as used in this thesis. Just as in the previous section, the distinctions are presented in the form of a classiﬁcation into levels of increasing complexity. is time, the classiﬁcation involves three overarching levels.
Sem#1 — Situation-speciﬁc aspects of action
Level 1 regards actions with primarily situation-speciﬁc relevance or meaning, which are not organized and recognizable as pre-established types of action. At this level, the “code” aspect of action meaning is weakest, and the situated “inference” aspect is strongest. is holds true no matter whether “inference” is interpreted in a mentalistic way (Sperber & Wilson, 1995 [1986]) or in a more praxis-oriented and “direct” way. ere is no diﬀerentiation between the form of the action and its meaning or purpose, and the action is a direct adaptation to a current local situation in its uniqueness. Already at this level actions may invoke the world at hand in various ways, such as making a certain object relevant by means of handling it somehow. erefore, already at this level, a basic form of reference is possible. Arguably, this level is more like a theoretical idealization than an empirical reality, since no action
30

2.2. U   
or situation is ever entirely “new” in all kinds of ways — prior experience is always brought into situations, and there are overarching generic schematisms and typiﬁcations in most kinds of actions such as reaching towards objects, grabbing them, picking them up, eventually putting them away, and so forth. Nevertheless, even in highly recognizable, typiﬁed, and conventionalized actions, there is always a local aspect of the action that relates to how the action is deployed in a particular way in a particular situation. As an action is performed in a local context, it always has the property of pushing the social activity forwards (cf. communicative dynamism, Firbas, 1971) in a situation-speciﬁc way, since every action — communicative, instrumental, or both — is a move that does something. In line with Schegloﬀ (1986) one may also point out that even in the case of routine activities, the performance is always to some extent a local situation-speciﬁc achievement. Hence, the motivation for the inclusion of this level in the classiﬁcation of semiotic complexity, is that it serves to acknowledge the potential of action dynamics to bring about novelty and change as well as the potential of action to orient to the particular conﬁgurations of speciﬁc unique situations, through the (locally) context-shaped and (locally) contextshaping aspects of action (cf. Heritage, 1984).
Sem#2 — Typiﬁed aspects of action (count-as)
Level 2 actions are those that not only have a particular local and situated meaning (Level 1), but also are recognizable as pre-established action types, i.e., as tokens of a type. e importance and roles of typiﬁcation in action, signiﬁcation, and intersubjectivity has perhaps been most rigorously analyzed in the work of Alfred Schutz (1943, 1951, 1953, 1954, 1955, 1959). Typiﬁed actions need not strictly speaking be a category of actions with clear-cut boundaries allowing someone to state whether a particular instance is unambiguously an instance of the type in question or not. e essential criterion is rather that of a sense of familiarity of a kind — as something that one has seen before, although perhaps not necessarily in the exact same form. A prime example is the canonical use of certain artifacts, such as using scissors for cutting or a pen for writing or drawing, in contrast to novel creative uses of artifacts, such as using scissors as electrical conductors or placing a pen underneath a ﬂower pot to raise the pot slightly.¹⁶ Typiﬁed action schematizations may constitute minimally a “doing it again” of an action performed just moments before, either by oneself or by someone else; they may also be a more situation-
¹⁶Another example: a few minutes ago, I killed a wasp with Wittgenstein (1953), simply because the book constituted material-at-hand that was useful for the purpose.

C 2: ”W  ?”    
transcending kind of typiﬁcation that extends across particular settings, eventually spreading among members of a community or culture (cf. mimesis, Donald, 1991; Zlatev, 2007). Even though the exact form of the performance of a typiﬁed action may not necessarily be governed by such well-deﬁned norms of correctness as those involved in some conventional gestures and signed languages, there is in many cases a conventional (i.e., socially shared) knowledge involved in knowing the form (third-person intentionality), typical purposes and relevancies, and suitable context(s) of such established ways of acting, although these need not necessarily be well-known in the sense that they have a corresponding vernacular name in ordinary language (cf. Schegloﬀ, 2007, p. 7).¹⁷
Since there is not only reference and local relevance, but also a basic typiﬁcation of form as well as content (that is not solely an idiosyncratic creation of the moment) the typiﬁed nature of the act makes a ﬁrst step towards representation. Level 2 actions are meaningful not just in relation to a particular situation in which they occur, but they may also count-as (Searle, 1995, p. 28) some particular situationtranscending type of action — a type/token relationship — although not in a way that diﬀerentiates form from meaning.¹⁸ As pointed out by Sinha (2009a, p. 302), the fact that something may count-as something does not mean that it represents it. Putting this another way, type/token relationships are not enough for something to be a representation in the stronger sense of a semiotic sign (Sonesson, 2007), as deﬁned below. An act of drinking coﬀee surely counts as an act of drinking coﬀee, at least in appropriate contexts. At the same time, and under most circumstances, it is an act of drinking coﬀee rather than a representation of this act. ere is no diﬀerentiation between expression and content/referent (Piaget, 1962 [1946]). In later chapters it will be argued that the coordination between count-as actions and speech is in many respects similar to the coordination between more complex kinds of signiﬁcation (i.e., gesture) and speech, and that this has so far received very little analytic attention despite the general trend toward emphasizing the relation between action and gesture in ontogeny and phylogeny, and on a more theoretical level.
e typiﬁed character of actions at this level does not replace local situational relevance (Level 1) as the eventual determinant of meaning, but the typiﬁed aspects of actions are rather to be seen as augmenting the concerns of speciﬁc situations by virtue of being more or less situation-transcending resources for meaning-
¹⁷A set of distinctions relating to the notion of conventionality are presented in Section 2.3.3. ¹⁸“X counts as Y in context C” (Searle, 1995, p. 28).
32

2.2. U   
making which are nevertheless employed in speciﬁc situations (Linell, 2009, pp. 49). Furthermore, it is not simply the case that such situation-transcending resources and typiﬁcations are used as templates for action — they are rather oriented to in the sense that strict adherence to them is not necessary (in the end, situational appropriateness has higher priority than, for example, grammatical correctness), and they should rather be thought of as resources that provide frames of interpretation (Coseriu, 1985, pp. xxxiv; Seedhouse, 2007). In a similar vein, instead of speaking of the development of symbolic skills in children only in terms of a one-sided process of decontextualization from context-bound skills to generalized abilities and schemas (Werner & Kaplan, 1963), it might be better to speak of trans-contextualization (cf. Zlatev, 1997, p. 193), because the latter term captures the aspects of abstracting features of action for use across situation (development as detachment and generalization) as well as the way any action still needs to be adapted appropriately to the particulars of situations, socio-cultural practices, and general norms of conduct, as evoked in speciﬁc situations (development as attachment or accumulation of speciﬁcation).¹⁹ No matter how abstract, rule-like, or generalized some aspect of action becomes, it is never applicable to just any moment in any kind of situation. In the words of Schutz (1954, p. 267), “typiﬁcation depends upon my problem at hand for the deﬁnition and solution of which the type has been formed.” Development of action is therefore a two-fold process of increasing degrees of abstractness and increasing degrees of speciﬁcity and concreteness in skill/knowledge in handling particular types of situations and activities, roughly corresponding to two metaphors of learning: the acquisition metaphor and the participation metaphor, both of which should be included in an understanding of learning and development (Sfard, 1998). e initial state of learners with respect to some particular not-yet-mastered ability is thus both non-generalized with respect to general principles as well as non-speciﬁed with respect to the relevant details, and the beneﬁt of the concept of typiﬁcation is that it includes both of these aspects.e emergence of typiﬁcation in action throughout development is as much a development along the axis of speciﬁcation in detail as along the axis of generalization and abstraction.
¹⁹Nevertheless, there seems to be a diﬀerence between humans and apes when it comes to decontextualization. Petitto (1988, p. 188) reports on her attempts to learn the chimpanzee Nim to make use of a signed language: “Only a few of his 125 signs were ever used regularly (e.g., NIM, MORE, EAT, DRINK, GIVE), and these occurred only in ﬁxed contexts (e.g., eating)”.

Sem#3 — Diﬀerentiated aspects of action (semiotic signs)
At Level 3 the form of the performance of an action is modulated in one of two main ways, or in both of these ways at once. e ﬁrst kind of modulation is modulation of the act itself: its movement and conﬁgurations, with regard to its form as it would have been performed the way one would typically have performed it when performing it for practical purposes. An example is when an act such as writing with a pencil is performed, but where this is done without a pencil in the hand: i.e., as an empty-handed gesture. e second kind of modulation is when a modulation of typicality is a result of factors outside the performance of the bodily movements and conﬁgurations in themselves, such as various sorts of highlighting, modiﬁcations, concretizations or vagueﬁcations, and re-contextualizations of an action, such as may be achieved by means of a concurrent spoken utterance or, perhaps, mere performance of the action in a peculiar context such as in the theater.
e quality of the reduced typicality that results from such modulations can take many forms, such as when only the beginning of an action is performed so as to invoke the action as a whole (intention movements, see also page 281), or when an action is performed in its entire duration, but where some aspect is le out that would be required in order to perform it for real, or “seriously” as Piaget (1962 [1946], p. 101) puts it. e modulations need not be subtractive, in the sense of taking something away. e typicality of the action may also be reduced by means of adding elements to the performance, such as exaggerations or repetitions of the action that normally do not belong in the action when performed plainly for practical purposes. No matter whether the modulation is achieved by means of additions, subtractions, or both, there is a reduction of typicality with respect to some typiﬁcation, such as how an act would be performed if it were a straightforwardly practical action. is reduction of typicality in Level 3 actions is qualitatively diﬀerent from the lack of typicality in Level 1 actions, since at Level 3 the non-typical aspects of an action stand out as non-typical precisely with reference to the invoked familiarity of some particular typiﬁcations. us a background of normal appearances (Goﬀman, 1971, pp. 238) of praxis is essential for the possibility of a Level 3 action (cf. forms of life, Wittgenstein, 1953), because it is this background that serves to bring about the contrast involved in seeing the modulation aspect of an action that makes it a Level 3 action rather than a Level 1 or Level 2 action.
Precisely due to the achievement of reduced typicality in these actions, the relation between expression and content is now more indirect, and an as if quality has entered into the picture — there is now an explicit diﬀerentiation between the
34

2.2. U   
expression as such and the content/referent.²⁰ As argued by Sonesson (2008) in a discussion of iconic semiotic signs, expressions that are too similar to what they stand for may, for this very reason, fail to achieve the status of diﬀerentiated iconic signs. In such cases, as paradigmatically exempliﬁed by the use of an object to stand for itself, some form of social convention may be required in order for a sign relationship to be recognizable (what he calls secondary iconic signs). “A car, which is not a sign on the street, becomes one at a car exhibition” (Sonesson, 2008, p. 51; see also Sonesson, 1989, p. 139; Sonesson, 1994, p. 279). In cases where there is too much similarity the expression may instead be interpreted in terms of the relationship of identity: i.e., a car on the street may not appear as a representation of a car but it will simply count-as a car — it will present rather than represent.
One common kind of reduction that is of central importance for the whole ﬁeld of gesture studies is of course the reduction of object-involving actions to emptyhanded gestures: the primary object of study for this ﬁeld. However, empty-handedness is only one of several possibilities for reduction of typicality, and it is no way necessary for an act to be empty-handed in order to qualify as Level 3 (Andrén, in press a). e fact that reductions of typicality can also be invoked by means of additions (both of the movements and conﬁgurations involved in the action itself and of “external” elements outside the movements of the action such as an utterance or a particular way of coordinating gaze), and not only by subtractions, is crucial because it means that there is no necessary opposition between instrumental and expressive/communicative aspects of action. ese two dimensions may well co-exist in one and the same action (Andrén, in press a; see also Streeck, 2009b, p. 4, 23, and 82).²¹
Sem#3 actions, in contrast to Sem#1 and Sem#2 actions, are characterized by being semiotic signs as a consequence of the indirectness achieved by means of a modulation. e term “semiotic sign” is not used here in the sense of the signs of signed language in a way that contrasts with gesture: hence the use of the label “semiotic sign” rather than just “sign”. It rather corresponds to how some authors use the
²⁰Ironically, performing an action in such less “typical” ways is in fact one of the main means for invoking an action to signify an ideal type itself (Andrén, in press c), to borrow a term from Max Weber (1947 [1922]) who did not refer to ideal in the sense of perfection, but rather to the world of ideas (as opposed to the particulars of tokens). e reason is that the performance may actually be hampered on a token level in the sense that its instrumentality may be reduced, and this eﬀectively reduces the token aspect of the action as well as bringing the type aspect of the action to the foreground.
²¹is is not to say that communicative aspects and practical aspects of action conceptually the same thing. e claim is merely that the presence of one of these two aspects of action in a given action does not require the absence of the other.
35

C 2: ”W  ?”    
terms “symbol” and “symbolic”. However, the terms “symbol” and “symbolic” are used in several diﬀerent ways in the literature on gesture. Sometimes symbols are associated with the diﬀerentiation between expression and content/referent (e.g. McNeill, 1992, p. 1). Sometimes they are associated with conventionality (Efron, 1941 [1972], p. 11) or arbitrariness (Bates et al., 1983, p. 77) in contrast to indexicality and iconicity. Sometimes they are associated with the presence of communicative intent (Namy, 2005; DeLoache, 2004, p. 66). A deﬁnition is clearly required. e term “sign” will be used here in accordance with the following deﬁnition, which is a slight adaption of the deﬁnitions given by Sonesson (2008, p. 49; 2009, p. 138) and Zlatev (2009, pp. 153). is deﬁnition furthermore clariﬁes the use of the term “symbolic” as intended here:
Deﬁnition of semiotic sign:
A sign is present if and only if E (Expression) signiﬁes C (typiﬁed Content) and/or R (a Referent in the world) for at least one S (subject) in some context(s) X, if and only if the following three criteria are fulﬁlled:
Criterion 1: E and C/R are related for S in context X: While directly perceiving or enacting E in context X, C and/or R (rather than E) is experienced as thematic. e basis for the establishment of a relation between E and C/R rests on the perceiving of either indexicality (contiguity and/or directedness), iconicity (similarity), or symbolicity (conventionality), or several of these grounds for meaning at once — sometimes multiple times in one and the same sign (cf. Peirce, 1931–35). Comment on criterion 1: is criterion in isolation only amounts to the basic forms of reference invoked by Sem#1 actions or to (symmetrical versions of the) count-as relation (Sem#2), and is not itself suﬃcient for something to be a semiotic sign (Sem#3). e mere presence of indexicality, iconicity, and/or symbolicity (i.e., conventionality) as such is therefore not suﬃcient for something to be a semiotic sign.²² Indexicality is sometimes deﬁned as being constituted by causality, but this is not how it is intended here. Following Sonesson (1996), indexicality is rather deﬁned as constituted by contiguity and directedness, as matters of “the ongoing practice of the ordinary world of our experience, […] our common Lifeworld”. To the extent that “causality” is a
²²As a consequence, not all meaningful actions are semiotic signs according to the deﬁnition provided here.
36

2.2. U   
phenomenon of the Lifeworld, it is not the same thing as causality in the sense of physics. e addition of directedness to the Peircian criterion of contiguity is motivated since “real indicators, such as ﬁngers and arrows, are equally contiguous to a number of objects which they do not indicate” (ibid.); and it is oen the directedness projected by an index, rather than its contiguity, that accounts for the meaning of this index. In a similar way, Eco (1976) has used the phrase movement towards to account for the meaning of pointing gestures. Sometimes arbitrariness is used as the criterion for symbolicity, but according to the view adopted here, symbolicity is better characterized by conventionality. Conventionality certainly makes arbitrariness possible, but arbitrariness itself is not required for something to be symbolic (Calbris, 1990; Zlatev, 2008a; Tomasello, 2008). e meaning of a gesture may be iconically and/or indexically motivated (hence not “arbitrary”, at least in one sense of the term) at the same time as the gesture is established as well-known and conventionalized, with some more or less determined meaning.²³
Criterion 2: E and C/R are asymmetrically related for S in context X: E stands for C and/or R in context X, but C or R does not stand for E (or at least not at the same time).
Comment on criterion 2: is criterion in conjunction with criterion 1 amounts to an asymmetrical version of the count-as relationship. Criteria 1 and 2 together are not suﬃcient for something to be a semiotic sign. Some of the relations, such as contiguity and similarity may intuitively be considered symmetrical, perhaps even per deﬁnition. Indeed, it has been argued that iconicity/similarity is a symmetric relation (i.e., that A is as similar to B as B is to A), and thus cannot account for the asymmetric relation between E and C/R in iconic signs (Goodman, 1970; see also Streeck, 2008a, p. 288). is may be the case if we consider this relation in terms of the equivalence relation of formal logic; but from an experiential point of view, E and C/R may well be asymmetrically related for S even though the ground for relatedness is iconicity/similarity (Sonesson, 2008, p. 56).
²³Arbitrariness, in another sense of the term, can be said to be present in any conventionalized entity, in so far as it could have had another form (it may in fact have another form in another culture, to the extent that the meaning of the sign could be said to be “the same” across the cultures), even if some aspects of its form may also be iconically or indexically motivated.

C 2: ”W  ?”    
Criterion 3: E and C/R are diﬀerentiated (Piaget, 1962 [1946]) for S in context X: E is qualitatively diﬀerent from C and/or R for S in context X. is diﬀerentiation may come about through additions of elements that lie outside an action or object conceived as the expression (as discussed above, p. 34), without any modiﬁcations of a movement or object itself: thus there may be nothing in the expression itself that tells us that it functions as a semiotic sign on a given occasion (Sonesson, 2007, pp. 13).²⁴
Comment on criterion 3: is criterion ﬁnally marks the distinctive conceptual diﬀerence between semiotic signs (Sem#3) and the count-as relation (Sem#2), both in its symmetrical and asymmetrical versions. Whether there is such a distinct diﬀerence on an empirical level between that which is diﬀerentiated and this which is not diﬀerentiated is another issue. By way of example, the notion of a gradual distancing between expression and content/referents in children’s development (Werner & Kaplan, 1963) is built on the idea that there may not be a distinct point during this process where a dichotomous switch occurs from strictly “qualitatively similar” to strictly “qualitatively diﬀerent”. I am inclined to agree with Werner and Kaplan on this point. In any case, the conceptual diﬀerence should be clear.
All of these criteria are to be interpreted as context dependent and perspectival experiences and expressions on behalf of subjects. In the case where they are part of social encounters, their meaning will to some extent also be a matter of intersubjective negotiation.²⁵ is stands in contrast to thinking of the meaning of semiotic signs as static entities that belong solely to physical properties of the expressions themselves. All these criteria presuppose subjects with particular points of view, engaged in particular activities with their associated relevancies and rationalities, who have come to be what they are due to a previous history of experiences and interactions with the world and other subjects. On the other hand, even though the meaning of semiotic signs is a “subjective” matter, people seem to be relatively consistent in
²⁴In non-communicative contexts, the addition may come about purely as a result of thought, without any overtly visible properties. Something may become a sign purely on the basis of considering it as such. e sun may be taken to stand for happiness, even though the sun itself was clearly not created for purposes of having this speciﬁc meaning — the meaning it has in this example is purely ascribed to it from the “outside” and is not a part of its constitutive structure.
²⁵Even in situations where a subject acts in isolation, the actions performed may derive at least in part from a previous history of social interactions (cf. Schutz & Luckmann, 1989). at is, it is not obvious how to diﬀerentiate “social” from “non-social” action.

what they see in certain gestural forms. Aspects of form should not be downplayed just because form does not fully determine meaning.
One seemingly minor but actually quite consequential aspect in this formulation of the deﬁnition of semiotic signs, with respect to research on gesture, is that there is an “and/or” inserted between C(ontent) and R(eferent). Instead of requiring that every sign involve both a referent and a content, it is useful to detach these two aspects of meaning: hence the “and/or” rather than “and”. For example, even though pointing gestures can sometimes clearly involve typiﬁed content, and even though pointing gestures can be very complex in semiotic terms²⁶, there are some instances where it is still possible to use pointing to refer to an object, without having any idea whatsoever what the target might be other than where it is located: i.e., without invoking typiﬁed content (cf. Wundt, 1973 [1921], p. 75). is kind of pointing is particularly useful for infants and very young children who may use pointing gestures to refer to things still largely unknown to them, to ask their parents what something is, or what it is called, and so on.²⁷ In such cases, the pointing gesture is eﬀectively relying on the immediate presence of the referent, and it may be less mediated by a typiﬁcation on the content level. It is rather the pointing gesture itself (i.e., its form) that is typiﬁed as well as the schematized relation between the expression and the referent ( → Target, where the target may be just about anything). is stands in contrast to what are sometimes called representational gestures (Kita, 2000; Nobe, 2000; Capirci et al., 1996; Kendon, 2004) (oen deﬁned so as to include so-called abstract pointing gestures to non-present entities and qualities, McNeill et al., 1993), descriptive gestures (Wundt, 1973 [1921]), or content-loaded gestures (Pizzuto & Capobianco, 2005), all of which involve typiﬁed content of some sort. It also stands in contrast to considering all pointing gestures as “object-referring terms, akin to nouns or pronouns” (Goldin-Meadow, 2007b, p. 743), since this rests on the assumption that pointing is always used to refer to some-
²⁶For example, people sometimes point to a target of some sort, which in turn stands for something else: the actual referent rather than the target pointed to (Kendon, 1980a, p. 86). A common practice, at least in Sweden, is pointing to a wristwatch (or where one would be) to indicate that time is running out (rather than just referring to a watch as such). Pointing gestures may also invoke various complex spatial frameworks as frames of reference (Haviland, 1993, 1998). Speakers of Arrernte, a central Australian (Pama-Nyungan) language, make use of a singular/plural contrast through diﬀerent conventionalized forms of pointing (Wilkins, 2003). Pointing gestures may also be used to indicate the past or future with reference to cultural metaphors that take the future as “ahead” and the past as “behind”, or vice versa in cultures that construe the ﬂow of time diﬀerently (Núñez & Sweetser, 2006; McNeill, 2005, p. 46).
²⁷e episodes from Superman where people point to “something” (which happens to be Superman) in the air as part of their attempts to identify this “something” also comes to mind.

It is possible to interpret the concept of “content” in other ways, so that content would always be considered to be present in a semiotic sign, but the interpretation I have oﬀered is suitable precisely because it allows for discussion of gestures that qualify as semiotic signs according to the deﬁnition given here, both in terms of what they share — they can all be characterized as semiotic signs by means of the three criteria above — and in terms of how they diﬀer — they may primarily be invoking a referent or they may invoke both a referent and a content. is distinction is further relevant because there is an overall development from more exclusively referential modes of expression into more content-loaded and referential ones in children’s development, and the ﬁrst communicative acts, such as pointing, giving, and showing are all of a more referential kind (e.g. Bates et al., 1979; Caselli, 1990).²⁸ Long ago, Wundt (1973 [1921], p. 75) argued in a similar way regarding the less demanding nature of (some) pointing gestures for children:
eir greater primitiveness [of pointing gestures compared to contentloaded gestures] is easily explained by the psychological conditions of their origin. Where an object referred to by a given gesture is in the realm of visible things, direct pointing at it with the index ﬁnger is the simplest, surest, and most straight-forward way of drawing attention to it.
Content-loaded (or representational) gestures themselves may vary in speciﬁcity. at is, they may vary with regard to whether they primarily serve to express a general concept (content), not referring to any speciﬁc referent, or whether they primarily serve to express a more particular referent. As an example, an iconic gesture may depict the general shape of an arched vault; not referring to any particular vault, or it may depict a particular vault that actually exists at a certain location (i.e., a referent) (cf. Fricke, 2009). Content-loaded gestures referring to a speciﬁc referent thus include content to the extent that these gestures involve a representation of the referent, and not just a reference to the uniquely present referent in the current situation as may the case may be for pointing gestures.
Finally, once expression and content/referent have been “detached” by some kind of diﬀerentiation, actions may be changed along a veritable array of further dimensions of variation into ever more complex and abstract forms of semiotic signs.
²⁸e development from more indicative modes of displays to more representational ones may sometimes also be observed within single situations (Hirsch, 1994, p. 481; LeBaron & Streeck, 2000; Roth, 2002).
40

2.2. U   
Content may become metaphorical (McNeill & Levy, 1982; Cienki & Müller, 2008) or metonymic so that a gesture invokes some content which in turn stands for something else (cf. the concept of a “base”, (Kendon, 1980a; Bergman, 1982; Müller et al., manuscript)). e techniques of realization involved in the articulation of various expressions (Kendon, 2004; Müller, 1998a; Wundt, 1973 [1921]) may depart from action-based logic into much more indirect forms of realization, where the hand is no longer seen as a hand. e space in which the action is performed may change from the concrete action space (where the actor is directed to the actual physical surroundings), to a supporting space (where non-present entities are invoked with support of present entities: a real table may serve as an ocean on which a boat is sailing), to a purely abstract space (where there is no relation between the signiﬁed and the actual current physical surroundings in which the expression is articulated).
As expressive actions begin to be detached from the concrete spatio-temporal domain of practical action in the world within reach, i.e., the core of the Lifeworld (Schutz & Luckmann, 1973), there are increasing degrees of freedom in the many ways in which semiosis may be achieved. erefore it might be said that semiotic complexity explodes into a multidimensional progression along many diﬀerent dimensions at this point in the classiﬁcation of levels of semiotic complexity. From this point on (if not before), it is not possible to arrange the increasing semiotic complexity along a single dimension of variation. us the classiﬁcation into levels on an ordinal one-dimensional scale stops here. Another reason is that actions that qualify as Sem#3 fulﬁll criteria that most researchers would consider suﬃcient to qualify as gesture, whereas Sem#1 actions clearly lie below the lower limit. e status of Sem#2 actions is more unclear, since the count-as relation involved in Sem#2 is typically not distinguished from Sem#1 and Sem#3 in the accounts of other researchers. Hence, the levels of semiotic complexity presented here provide an analytic vocabulary that covers the (continuous) span of action that lie below, “around”, and above the lower limit of gesture.
It may be worth repeating that although Sem#3 actions rely heavily on a world known in common and taken for granted in various ways (i.e., the Lifeworld), it is not the case that semiotic signs only draw on pre-existing meaning. e act of producing a sign is always in itself also a meaning-creating act — an act of construal which leaves some things out and emphasizes others, and which may have unintended and unexpected consequences (cf. communicative dynamism, Firbas, 1971), as pointed out in the discussion of Sem#1 actions. However, to some extent the same goes for count-as actions (Sem#2 actions). An action may itself serve as an establishment of a type of action, even though there was no such type in existence

before the action was performed, and so it creates the category of which it will itself count as token. A case in point is when a type of action is demonstrated to another person; “you unlock the door like this+”.
2.2.4 Children and the lower limit
ere are numerous studies that conﬁrm that all the levels of communicative explicitness are already oen achieved when children are 18 months of age or younger. is is evidenced with respect both to children’s performances and comprehension of communicative actions and to parents’ comprehension of children’s actions (e.g. Bates et al., 1975, 1979; Masur, 1983; Masataka, 2003; Behne et al., 2005; Liszkowski et al., 2006; Gräfenhain et al., 2009). Since this thesis takes the age of 18 months as its starting point, the question of when this sort of sensitivity to the intentional structure of communicative actions emerges is not a central concern, although it is clearly one of the main concerns of many studies on gesture in younger children. In a similar way, numerous studies conﬁrm that most children are capable of performing actions up through Sem#3 actions of semiotic complexity before 18 months, both when it comes to gesture (e.g. Bates et al., 1979; Volterra & Erting, 1990; Iverson & Goldin-Meadow, 1998) and speech (e.g. Bates et al., 1988).
Abilities to anticipate goals of familiar and typiﬁed everyday actions (action intentions) emerge already in infants ﬁrst year of life, even though what is familiar or not to an infant primarily depends on experience and only indirectly on age as such (e.g. Gredebäck & Melinder, 2010); and infants are obviously not yet familiar with many sorts of actions (e.g. the notion of life-time learning). e various distinctions in terms of levels that have been presented in connection with the issue of the lower limit of gesture are thus not primarily used in this thesis to analyze stages in children’s development. Instead, they are used ﬁrst and foremost for descriptive purposes, to characterize a variable array of actions in the repertoires of children all of which may be present at one and the same point in time.
2.2.5 Deﬁning gesture in the context of the lower limit
In consequence of the distinctions made so far, it becomes clearly possible to conceive of gesture as constituted by properties that belong to two separate continua — one continuum of communicative explicitness and one of semiotic complexity. Even though these two continua are closely related in practice, they do not necessarily overlap or follow each other. at is, already at Level 1 of semiotic complexity, an
42

2.2. U   
expressive action may in principle qualify for Level 3 (or higher) of communicative explicitness. Something which is far from being a sign, can still be relatively explicit in communicative terms. e opposite also holds true. An expressive action can be semiotically complex in, without being part of the communicative organization of a social encounter. In order to be clearer about which aspects of gesture are discussed in later chapters, a few terms other than “gesture” will be used when it is necessary to be more speciﬁc about a particular expressive action:
A    (ABC): Actions that qualify for Level 3 of communicative explicitness (visibly other-oriented action). Such actions need not be semiotically complex, although they can be.
A    (ABS): Actions that qualify for Level 3 of semiotic complexity (signs, as deﬁned in Section 2.2.3). Such acts are not necessarily part of the communicative organization of a social encounter, although they can be. ose ABSs that are not correspond to the class of actions sometimes referred to as private gesture (e.g. Rodríguez, 2009).
A     (ABCS): Actions that qualify both as ABCs and as ABSs. ABCSs are thus instances of communicative signs, rather than being communicative only (ABCs) or signs only (ABSs). Communicative signs need not be instances of bodily expression; they can also be realized through speech, writing, pictures, and other expressive modalities (semiotic resources), as well as through the co-expressive synergies of multiple modalities.
G: Actions that are either ABCs, ABCs, or both (i.e., ABCSs). is captures the common but somewhat ambiguous usage of the term “gesture”. e term “expressive” will be used to capture the ambiguity between signiﬁcation (even when it is performed for the self ) and communication (with an orientation to the Other), so that an expressive act is either (at least) a Sem#3 action or a Comm#3 action (or both).
As mentioned before, these conceptual distinctions and deﬁnitions should be understood precisely at a conceptual level. To what extent actually occurring actions lend themselves to clear-cut conceptual classiﬁcation of this kind is an empirical question. Furthermore, it is not only an empirical problem for scientists, from within the scientiﬁc attitude; it is also to some extent a practical problem that faces participants in everyday interactions, from within the natural attitude.

2.3 Unpacking the upper limit
In Section 2.1 it was stated that many researchers treat gesture as something diﬀerent from signed language, even though gesture (so conceived) and signed language also have many similarities. is distinction between “gesture” and “language” was termed the upper limit of gesture. One essential underlying similarity between gesture and signed language is that both are instantiated by the same bodily expressive medium, meaning that they share a set of similar conditions and potentialities for expression (Kendon, 2004, Chapter 14–15). Furthermore, both the signs of signed languages and at least some gestures (i.e., ABSs) satisfy the positive criteria for being semiotic signs (according to the deﬁnition provided in Section 2.2.5).²⁹ e diﬀerences between gesture and signed language are primarily formulated in terms of properties that are lacking in gesture, i.e., negative criteria, but that are present in (signed) language. An example of such a characterization of gesture is made by McNeill (2005), who describes a spontaneously created gesture, corresponding to what he calls gesticulation.³⁰ He then uses this gesture as a principal example of a kind of gesture that is diﬀerent from more language-like forms of bodily expression such as conventionalized gestures and signed language (ibid., p. 7, italics added):
e bends-it-back gesture lacks all linguistic properties. It was nonmorphemic, not realized through a system of phonological form constraints, and had no potential for syntactic combination with other gestures.
is means that the question of diﬀerences and similarities between gesture and signed languages is tightly coupled with the question of how to deﬁne language (and gesture). Language deﬁnitions almost always consist of several diﬀerent properties that collectively make some expressive repertoire a language (Saussure, 1983 [1916]; Hockett, 1966). However, some of these properties, such as diﬀerentiation between expression and content or the fact that signs may be conventionalized, may be present in a gesture without any implications of other language deﬁning properties, such as systematicity.³¹ us, conventionalized acts of bodily signiﬁcation will have some but not all properties typically associated with language. ese ges-
²⁹Positive criteria are criteria formulated in terms of the presence of a certain property (what gesture is), as opposed to negative criteria that concern the lack of a certain property (what gesture is not).
³⁰Authors who have used the term “gesticulation” before McNeill include Efron (1941 [1972]) and Kendon (1980b).
³¹Properties such as arbitrariness (Saussure, 1983 [1916]) and displacement (Hockett, 1966; see also Blake, 2000, p. 78) may also occur in gesture without implications of a necessary presence of systematicity. But in terms of this thesis, arbitrariness and displacement are considered as emerg-

2.3. U   
tures are oen called emblems in the gesture literature (Efron, 1941 [1972]; Ekman & Friesen, 1969; McNeill, 1992). A repertoire of conventional gestures without much systematicity, either on the level of form or on the level of meaning, correspond roughly to what is sometimes called “protolanguage” (Corballis, 2002; Bickerton, 2003; Zlatev et al., 2008a, p. 221). As long as systematicity is not present in a repertoire of signs, most gesture researchers do not consider it to be a language. What this means that some properties that are commonly part of language deﬁnitions actually occur below the upper limit gesture.
Indeed, systematicity is the property typically invoked as deﬁnitive of the upper limit of gesture — the boundary between that which is considered to be gesture and that which is considered to be signed language (e.g. McNeill, 2000, 2005; Zlatev, 2008a,b). Yet, systematicity is a multifaceted and heterogeneous notion that includes a range of diﬀerent conventionalized aspects of expression such as wordorder patterns, morphology/inﬂection, parts of speech, double articulation, contrasts between forms as well as between meanings in the system, and so forth. Even though it is not always clear where exactly to draw the line between having and not having some or all of these properties in particular cases(Kendon, 2004, Chapter 14–15), it is clear that what is usually thought of as language has a lot of these properties, and that gesture has far fewer of them. e diﬀerence is thus at least relatively clear on a conceptual level, though less so on an empirical level due to the many intermediate forms of systematicity that exist (ibid.).
In any case, the issue of the upper limit of gesture is relevant to this thesis, but not in the same way as the lower limit. e reason is that the children studied here are all hearing-enabled children who have not been exposed to signed language, which means that they are not, aer all, really crossing the “border” of the upper limit in the sense of learning a full-ﬂedged signed language. erefore, there is no real reason to assume that any of these children’s more complex bodily expressions ought to be classiﬁed as anything other than “gesture”. What is of interest here is rather if and how, and to what extent, there are rudimentary language-like properties in the gestures of these children. e two main topics that will be analyzed in this thesis, with respect to the upper limit, are diﬀerent forms of conventionality in the children’s gestures; and second, the nature of diﬀerent combinations of expressive units within, and across, the expressive modalities of gesture and speech.
ing from the more basic properties of diﬀerentiation and conventionalization. Displacement is the possibility of communicating about things beyond the here and now.

2.3.1 e status of conventionalized gestures
In the quote from McNeill (2005) above, a gesture was described that served to exemplify what McNeill calls a gesticulation: gestures that lack “all” linguistic properties. In his further discussion, McNeill adds: “ere are no conventions telling the speaker what form bending back is to take” (ibid., p. 10); hence he makes a distinction between the non-conventional gestures that he call gesticulation and the conventionalized gestures he calls emblems (cf. Efron, 1941 [1972]; Ekman & Friesen, 1969; Johnson et al., 1975; Morris et al., 1979). McNeill’s research is concerned with gesticulation (ibid., p. 4), but he clearly acknowledges the existence of emblems as existing between gesticulation and language — close to the notion of “protolanguage” (Bickerton, 2003; Zlatev, 2008a, p. 221) as mentioned before. He further acknowledges that conventionalized gestures may be used in concert with speech (what is called co-speech gesture). McNeill (2005, p. 12) writes:
Emblems are at an intermediate position on the various dimensions of contrasting gestures. ey are partly like gesticulations, partly like signs [of signed language]. For many individuals, emblems are the closest thing to a sign ‘language’ they possess, although it is crucial to emphasize the non-linguistic character of these gestures: they lack a fully contrastive system […] and syntactic potential (the impossibility of combining two emblems into a gesture sentence).
e term “emblem” refers speciﬁcally to those gestures that are word-like in the sense that a speciﬁc gestural form is related to a more or less speciﬁc content by means of conventionality (Efron, 1941 [1972]). Just as there are dictionaries for words, there are dictionaries of emblems as well as documentation on how their meanings differ between cultures and geographical areas (e.g. Efron, 1941 [1972]; Saitz & Cervenka, 1962; Green, 1968; Morris et al., 1979; Payrató, 1993). Ekman & Friesen (1969, p. 63) also make use of the term emblems, and deﬁne it as “those nonverbal acts which have a direct verbal translation, or dictionary deﬁnition, usually consisting of a word or two, or perhaps a phrase.” Neuropsychological research indicates that deaf people who use American Sign Language “process” emblems similarly to ASL signs and that this diﬀers from the “processing” of iconic gestures (Husain et al., 2009).
ere are, however, diﬀerent degrees of conventionalization in gesture, and gestures may be conventional in diﬀerent ways (Kendon, 2004; Andrén, in press c). In eﬀect, not all aspects of conventionality in gesture ﬁt nicely into the concept of emblems. erefore, I will treat “conventionalized gestures” as a broader notion than
46

2.3. U   
“emblems”. Indeed, the notion of conventionalized gestures is broader than the notion of emblems even when the considerations of conventionality are restricted to the conventionality present within the sign relationship, in the form of (A) conventionalized form, (B) conventionalized meaning, (C) conventionalized relations between form and meaning, and (D) conventionalized contexts of use. Emblems are typically conventionalized with respect to all four of these types of conventionality, whereas the notion of conventionalized gestures, as used here, does not require all of these aspects to be present. Apart from the conventionality that may be present within the sign relationship, gestures may also be sensitive to conventions at other levels such as norms of proper conduct (cf. Kita, 2009). In addition, one could distinguish between diﬀerent levels of conventionality, and such a classiﬁcation is presented below. It should further be pointed out that when the term “conventional gesture” it is not implied that the gesture is only conventional — the gesture may also invoke indexicality and iconicity as grounds for meaning, in accordance with the deﬁnition of semiotic signs (Section 2.2.3).
McNeill’s way of conceptualizing gesture has become very inﬂuential, especially in psychologically oriented research on gesture. It could be argued that in research that adopts this conceptualization there is a tendency, at least implicitly, to equate the otherwise more general notion of gesture with McNeill’s more narrow notion of gesticulation, amounting to an exclusion of considerations of conventional aspects of gesture. McNeill’s project of bringing the dynamic and creative dimension (the non-conventionalized dimension) of gestural expression into the foreground certainly has its merits. Above all this is so because McNeill’s perspective provides an antidote to one-sided structuralist approaches to gesture only in terms of “preestablished” forms and meanings. However, as a result of this conceptualization the pendulum sometimes swings too far, and there may be a bias towards downplaying the role of conventionality in gesture in general and co-speech gesture in particular. At worst, it may result in somewhat homogenized and sometimes even circular statements about the nature of gesture, because conventional aspects of gestures are oen excluded from the analytical scope at the outset. Kendon (1996) makes a similar point with respect to McNeill’s way of conceptualizing gesture:
It is oen said that gesticulation is idiosyncratic, each speaker improvising his own forms. So far as I know, no one has ever really tested this claim. My own experience in gesture-watching suggests to me that people are far more consistent in what they do gesturally than this ‘idiosyncrasy’ claim would lead one to imagine. One’s own experience in noticing diﬀerences in ‘gesture style’ from one culture to another, the work
47

C 2: ”W  ?”    
of David Efron (1941 [1972]), etc. actually conﬁrms this point. It suggests that […] there is conventionalization to a degree aﬀecting all kinds of gesturing […]. ³²
Kendon (2008, p. 360) also points out that “this exclusion of so-called ‘emblems’ has had the unfortunate consequence that they have been little studied”. In fact, McNeill (2005, p. 51) seems to agree with this, and suggests that “to settle the form question, and at what level conventions apply, several probes of conventional forms could be attempted. […] Until very recently, no one has used these probes and the answers to such questions have not been sought”.
Still, the blind spot in the research territory suggested in these quotes from McNeill and Kendon is not quite as severe as the blind spot surrounding some of the expressive acts that reside around the lower limit of gesture. Most gesture researchers do, aer all, clearly acknowledge the existence of conventionalization in gesture without equating such gestures with language, even though many researchers then take McNeill’s lead in restricting their studies so as to exclude conventionalized aspects of gesture from their analytical scope.
Furthermore, McNeill (2005, p. 7; see also Morris et al., 1979, p. xvi and Brewer, 1951, p. 234) characterizes the relation between emblems and speech as “optional”: conventionalized gestures may be performed without any co-occurring speech and still be clearly intelligible due to their pre-established and commonly-known character. For this reason emblems have sometimes also been called “autonomous gestures” (Kendon, 1985a, p. 8; Payrató, 1993). For non-conventionalized gestures, the situation is oen diﬀerent. It has been found that many gestures that are produced in concert with speech (co-speech gesture) are diﬃcult to interpret without this co-occurring speech. ey are, so to speak, designed to be expressive in concert with speech and may therefore not be shaped so as to be self-suﬃcient autonomously expressive units (cf. McNeill, 1985, p. 351; Singleton et al., 1995; Goldin-Meadow et al., 1996; see also Kendon, 2004, Chapter 14). Nonetheless, there are cases where gestures without conventionalized properties may function in an autonomous fashion. One case is when gestures are inserted into a “syntactic slot”
³²e “ ‘idiosyncrasy’ claim” refers to McNeill’s (1992; 2005) conception of “gesticulation” as those gestures that are created by speakers rather than being culturally spread conventions. McNeill’s use of the term “idiosyncratic” seems slightly ambiguous though. Sometimes it seems to refer to gestures that are created in the moment (McNeill, 2005, p. 8), and sometimes it also seems to include gestures that are not conventional in the sense of being socially shared forms of expression, but that may still be some sort of individual image-schematic habits (McNeill & Sowa, 2007), hence not necessarily creations of the moment although they may at least in theory be restricted to one individual (see also Parrill, 2007).

2.3. U   
in an utterance where a word has been, so to speak, le out. For example: when saying “he went [] a few moments ago” (Slama-Cazacu, 1976; Ladewig, 2010). It could be argued that this is a kind of “co-speech” gesture too, even though the gesture may not overlap in time with any of the words, because the meaning of the surrounding speech contributes to the interpretation of the gesture. ere are also cases observed in the data studied in this thesis of gesture-only utterances without any speech at all, where the gestures performed are not conventionalized. ese may provide a better example to make the point that non-conventionalized gestures may be used as self-suﬃcient autonomous utterances.
Let us return to conventionalized gestures and their relation to speech. Characterizing the presence of speech in co-occurrence with conventional gestures as “optional” may give the unfortunate impression that conventionality in co-speech gesture is a marginal phenomenon and that it would somehow be atypical for conventionalized gestures to be “designed” to be usable in concert with speech (cf. Kendon, 2004, p. 106; Seyfeddinipur, 2004). I suggest, therefore, that the use of the term emblem as a general label for conventional gestures is not productive, since it tends to lead to an exaggerated emphasis on the “autonomous” character of (all) gestures with conventionalized properties, and in eﬀect, an exaggerated emphasis on the diﬀerences between conventional gestures and the co-speech gestures that McNeill calls gesticulation.³³ In this spirit, Kendon argues that:
Observations of speakers in communities where there is a considerable repertoire of such [conventionalized] forms show that their use is oen fully integrated into the ﬂow of everyday discourse and that their sharp separation from non-conventionalized forms that many gesture-classiﬁcation systems imply, cannot be sustained. (Kendon, 2008, p. 360, italics added)
[…] it is far from being the case that gestures that are always associated with speech are less conventionalized than those that are not. (Kendon, 2004, p. 106; see also Kendon, 1984, p. 94)
Arguably, such coordination of conventionalized gestures with speech is found not only in “gesture rich” cultures, of which southern Italy is perhaps the prototypical example (cf. Kendon, 1995, 2004; Iverson et al., 2008). e presence of various forms of conventionality in co-speech gesture may be more frequent and general than is commonly assumed to be the case. One recent description of conventionalized co-speech gestures can be found in the work of Harrison (2009b). Harrison
³³is is not to deny that there is a class of conventional gestures that can be used autonomously.
49

C 2: ”W  ?”    
documents the performance of conventionalized gestures of rejection and negation as used in tight coordination with speech among adult native speakers of English. Harrison shows how various conventionalized gestural expressions of negation may be temporally organized so as to cover the negated parts of syntactic clauses in the spoken utterances (what Harrison calls the scope of negation). at is, even though some of the gestural forms that Harrison describes may be potentially understandable, at least to some extent, without speech, it is misleading to characterize the presence of speech in relation to gestures with conventionalized aspects as merely “optional”, as this makes the ordered performance of conventional gestures in coordination with speech seem almost superﬁcial.
ere is indeed quite a large number of gestures that are conventionalized in some respect, and that are frequently, or even typically, used in coordination with speech. Examples include gestures that perform such “pragmatic functions” as marking an utterance as a question, handing over the speech turn to someone else, holding the turn, or even presenting an abstract idea (e.g. Duncan, 1972; Kendon, 1995, 2002, 2004; Müller, 2004; Neumann, 2004; Seyfeddinipur, 2004; Mondada, 2006; Seo & Koshik, 2010). Other gestures that are routinely coordinated with speech include highly frequent and conventionalized gestures such as head gestures including nodding, head-shakes, head-tosses, and so forth (Darwin, 1872; Morris et al., 1979; Junefelt, 1987; Anderson & Reilly, 1997; Kendon, 2002; McClave, 2007); and pointing gestures which are at least partly conventional in form (cf. McNeill, 2005, p. 12), as shown by studies of diﬀerent forms of pointing in diﬀerent cultures (Sherzer, 1972, 1991; Johnson et al., 1975; Enﬁeld, 2001; Kendon & Versante, 2003; Wilkins, 2003). Blind children are, for example, not as inclined to use the index ﬁnger form of pointing as sighted children are (Junefelt, 1987; Iverson, 1998), which may be interpreted as a lack of conventional “domestication” of their pointing gestures due to the absence of visual experience of others’ gestures. In a longitudinal study of three Swedish and three ai children between 18 and 28 months of age (Zlatev & Andrén, 2009), pointing and conventional gestures (in particular nodding and head-shakes) were by far the most frequent gestures expressed in both cultures.³⁴ Similarly, in a study of ﬁve bilingual (English and French) children between 24 and 42 months of age Nicoladis et al. (1999, p. 518) report that “the most frequent type of gesture produced by all the children with English and French utterances was the point, followed by emblem and give gestures”; none of these gestures are of course spontaneous creations of the moment. Findings such as these

have lead Guidetti & Nicoladis (2008, p. 109) to suggest that:
If our reasoning is correct, then infants may use primarily conventional gestures, as well as gestures that they have learned by acting in the world (such as ‘pick-me-up’). ere is a curious lack of the predominant kind of gesture used by adults: spontaneous, non-conventional gestures that seem to be created on the spot to convey meaning […].
As will be seen, this quote also ﬁnds support in the analyses presented in several of the chapters of this thesis, although it should also be added that indexicality (in particular) and iconicity will play important roles too. To be clear: the aim of this thesis, with respect to the upper limit of gesture, is not to provide a one-sided emphasis on conventionalized aspects of gesture, or to say that such conventionalized aspects have no implications on how gestures can be used with or without speech; rather the aim is to put conventionality on a more equal footing with indexicality and iconicity in the understanding of gesture in general and of co-speech gesture in particular. To make further progress in research on conventionality in gesture it may be a good idea to distinguish between diﬀerent kinds and levels of conventionality. But before presenting a number of such distinctions, it may be useful to oﬀer a few considerations on how preexisting conventions might be learned.
2.3.2 From imitation to imitative processes
What are the processes by which conventions that pre-exist the individual may be learned? A ﬁrst distinction to make, raised in the quote from Guidetti and Nicoladis above, is the one between imitation and ritualization (cf. Tomasello, 1996). Imitation and ritualization constitute two analytically distinct routes to the emergence of socially schematized and conventionalized actions: the ﬁrst in a symmetrical way, the other one in an asymmetrical way, as described below.
Imitation (or “copying”) refers to the skill of appropriating actions performed by others into one’s own repertoire. When imitation is understood as an autonomous individual ability, it presupposes the ability to conceive of the action of the Other as a type, rather than as a unique token. at type is “distinct from the body of the other in its speciﬁcity, so that it can be repeated by the self ” (Sonesson, 2007, p. 116). Imitation, in a more general sense, is not always a result of purely individual abilities though, as it may also involve the active assistance of others (ZukowGoldring, 2006; Zukow-Goldring & Arbib, 2007). at is, imitative processes may involve what Vygotsky (1962, 1978) has called scaﬀolding, whereby a child manages

to do things beyond the capabilities of the child as an individual thanks to the support of someone else. In a similar vein, Hay & Murray (1982) performed a study on 12-month-old infants and the results suggested that “the modeling of a social action alone, without explicit prompts for imitation and/or a game-like pacing of modeled events, may not be suﬃcient to induce infants to perform that action” and that “the impact of the social behaviors infants see modeled is likely to be tempered by the network of interactive events in which they are embedded.” Imitative processes are symmetric, in the sense that the outcome of the process is the imitator doing something from the repertoire of someone else, not by accident but through some motivated process. One may distinguish between diﬀerent kinds of imitative processes, such as imitating the form of an action versus imitating its goal or result; and some authors have made even ﬁner-grained distinctions (Whiten et al., 2004). It is not necessary that the imitated action be a conventionalized one; in principle any (not overly acrobatic) action can be imitated. It is, however, clear that imitative processes are of fundamental importance for the possibility of conventionality, since the socially shared (i.e., symmetric) character of conventionality presupposes the possibility of copying others’ actions (Zlatev, 2005; Ziemke et al., 2007).³⁵ Hence, processes of imitation are one way in which socially schematized and typiﬁed actions may emerge in the child.
Ritualization refers to social learning that is not based on copying others actions, but that is rather a matter of habitual action emerging from routine activities in which the participants play complementary roles. Returning to the example from the Guidetti & Nicoladis (2008) quote above, aer a parent has lied an infant from a chair many times, the child may start raising her arms in anticipation, and ﬁnally start liing the arms as a communicative act that signals to the adult that the child wants to be picked up. In this example, it is quite clear that the emergence of pick-me-up is not a matter of symmetric copying, but rather of a schematized and asymmetric interaction where the child and the adult plays complementary roles. It is likely that most children have never observed an adult liing his or her hands to be picked up in this way.
As stated above, imitation and ritualization are analytically distinct routes to social learning, but this does not mean that particular skills, especially those that are learned over time, result from either ritualization or imitation but not both. Both
³⁵Not all conventional relationships are symmetric in this simple sense. Conventions may also concern asymmetric relationships, such as the way younger people are supposed to address elderly people. In such cases it would be wrong of the child to act like an elderly person in addressing her, i.e., it would be wrong to “copy” the way an elderly person acts.
52

2.3. U   
kinds of processes may be involved. A possible candidate for such a “dual” explanation is the emergence of pointing in infants. is is commonly viewed as an either-or question (e.g. Tomasello, 2008, p. 112) — is pointing a result of ritualization (from reaching) or is it a result of imitating what others do? In a similar way, one could ask the more general question — Are conventions learned through imitation or through ritualization? — and argue that the answer is a bit of both. While it seems fairly evident that imitative processes are involved, children do not simply hear conventionalized words and see conventionalized actions and gestures and learn solely from this input; they also get a lot of feedback from others in response to what they do. In this way, a heterogeneous array of complementary/asymmetric actions (actions other than the target action) ﬁgure as components in the process that lead to the eventual copying of the target action.³⁶ Junefelt (1987) describes how a blind child was explicitly socialized into using index ﬁnger pointing and other conventional gestures such as head-shakes and nodding, demonstrating how the imitative “transfer” of various actions may be implemented in alternative ways, that still end up in a learned convention. Hearing- and sight-enabled 16-month-olds have been shown to imitate actions selectively depending on how the act is embedded in an interactive sequence (Carpenter et al., 1998). e children in the study were much more inclined to imitate actions produced together with the exclamation “ere!” than the same actions when produced with the exclamation “Whoops!”. at is, factors “outside” the action to be imitated are also part of the process that leads to successful imitation.
In sum, the emergence of conventionalized actions in the repertoires of children should not be understood as resulting from a single process. It may be more useful to characterize the abilities of children for learning conventions as an ability to integrate a heterogeneous array of quite disparate forms of “evidence”, on many levels, into coherent conduct. e notion of imitative processes, as opposed to the narrower concept of imitation, will be used here as an umbrella term for this heterogeneous
³⁶An interesting case in this regard is the deaf children of hearing parents who do not teach their children signed language (called homesign). ese children tend to create rudimentary signed languages of their own (Heider & Heider, 1941). ese children are oen said to “lack input” in the sense that they lack input of a conventionalized language (Goldin-Meadow & Feldman, 1975; Goldin-Meadow, 2003b), i.e., symmetrical input of target actions. at is of course true to a considerable degree, especially for the auditory modality. However, there is inevitably a lot of asymmetrical input in the form of all sorts of responses to the children’s actions (Da Cuhna Pereira & De Lemos, 1990) as well as symmetrical input in the form of gestures and actions that may be imitated. ese other forms of input are potentially of huge importance for the children’s ability to “create” an expressive and stable repertoire of signs, along with “rules” for combining these signs, even though the repertoires do not correspond in any particular way to the language spoken by their parents.

set of factors that contribute to the transmission of conventions. Strictly speaking, some speciﬁc imitative processes do not by necessity include direct imitation as a component. Someone may, for example, teach someone else how to do a target action, not by showing them the action itself, but by telling them how it is done, or helping them in other ways to perform it.
2.3.3 Levels of conventionalization
e term conventionality is used in many diﬀerent ways. Some bear of a resemblance to concepts such as sharedness, normativity, regularity, recurrence, formality, routine, habituality, artiﬁciality, and so forth, but these concepts are only partially overlapping in meaning. An essential property running through all the senses of “conventionality” discussed in this section is that they concern recurrent patterns that recur across individuals that are members of the same group(s), but not across individuals of diﬀerent groups (other than by co-incidence). To gain a bit of precision, one can distinguish between at least four levels of conventionality that diﬀer in their degree of explicitness. Level 1 is least explicit, and Level 4 is most explicit. On an empirical level, these levels may represent more of a continuum, although on a conceptual level, they are distinct.
Conv#1 — Normality
Since members of the same group(s) share many things by virtue of engaging in similar kinds of activities, in similar settings (cf. forms of life, Wittgenstein, 1953; communities of practice, Wenger, 1998), there is a level of socially shared regularities which is essentially a matter of normality (cf. normal appearances, Goﬀman, 1971, pp. 238; body techniques, Mauss, 1979 [1936]; habitus, Bourdieu, 1977), although they may not appear “normal” or “typical” from the point of view of members of other groups (cf. Schutz, 1944, on the structure of being a stranger). Such assumptions about normality may go entirely unnoticed unless the normal order is somehow disturbed (cf. Garﬁnkel, 1964, p. 236). Normality, as deﬁned here, is to be understood as the lack of the atypical rather than as some explicitly speciﬁed experiential structure. Consider how the train drivers in the London Underground may notice that a station platform they are approaching is particularly busy or empty. Crucially, this is possible only against some sort of background assumptions of what constitutes “normal activity” on a platform (Heath et al., 1999, p. 563), however vague these assumptions may be. Members of a group do not need to be meta-aware
54

2.3. U   
of these things: they need not know that they know them. ey are typically, rather, a matter of pre-reﬂective knowledge.³⁷ Normality as such does not directly specify what members “ought” to do: if some atypical phenomenon would start to appear on a more regular basis, it would soon become typical, no matter how undesirable or “wrong” it may be judged to be. Deadly violence is an everyday experience for some groups of people (whereas for many others, it is not). Already this level of conventionality presupposes a certain degree of recurrence of some phenomenon. Recurrence is a property shared by all the levels of conventionality presented here, despite the other diﬀerences between the levels that make them conceptually distinct.
A “group” may be anything from a mother and a child, a family, a couple of friends, colleagues at work, to the citizens of a certain city or country. e only requirement for something to be or have the potential of becoming a group is that there is at least some minimal, and sometimes very indirect and mediated, contact between the members. Any individual person is a member of a large number of groups, making it problematic to conceive of people as members of a single group or culture.
Conv#2 — Typiﬁcation
At this level, acting in certain ways does not just appear as more or less “normal”. Actions on this level are acts of this or that type for the members of a group, i.e., a shared (and context-related) categorization has taken place. When a Conv#2 action is performed, it counts as a token of a certain type of action. e knowledge involved here is therefore of a more structured and typiﬁed kind than on the previous level. is is in line with Bach & Harnish (1979, p. 108) who state that “for us, conventions are counts-as rules and nothing else” ese “rules” specify only that something is an instance of a type, with no implication whether performing a certain typiﬁed action in context X is socially obligatory (cf. ibid., p. 121), and no implication that deviations from typiﬁed ways of performing the action will necessarily be perceived as wrong. Cases where such restrictions apply belong rather to the next levels (Conv#3 and #4).
Consider when someone presses the power button on a TV. is counts not just
³⁷Something that may be conventionalized at this level are those phenomena that are studied under the label of proxemics (e.g. Hall, 1963; Mehrabian, 1971; Rosenfeld et al., 1976; Shuter, 1976), namely issues related to the appearances and sustainment of certain interpersonal distances in social encounters as well as the cultural diﬀerences that exist in these respects.
55

C 2: ”W  ?”    
as a normal way of acting, but more precisely as “turning the TV on”.³⁸ Pressing the power button on a TV is not typically seen as some random movement. It is more likely to be taken as an action that relates to the typical uses and rationalities associated with the power buttons on a TV. Many mundane everyday actions are of this recognizable, seen before, familiar, and already established kind: they are tokens of types. People frequently operate on the (oen implicit) assumption that others will see such actions in this light. Of course, it may be less clear what is going on from the point of view of someone who is not familiar with the workings of a TV, such as an infant or a person from a culture where TVs are unknown. Conv#2 actions are usually a lot easier to express succinctly than Conv#1 actions, and some may even have names (usually as verbs) in ordinary language. When one member of a group tells another member of the group that some person “turned the TV on”, the other will immediately know what this refers to. Likewise, consider the the typiﬁed action of “swimming”. Although the particular style of swimming that is predominant in a culture in a certain historical period may be more of a pre-reﬂective Conv#1 phenomenon (cf. Mauss, 1979 [1936]), that certain ways of acting, in certain contexts, may count as instances of swimming (tokens of the “swimming” type) is a Conv#2 phenomenon.
Typiﬁed action and the associated count-as relation were also discussed in Section 2.2.3, in the context of Level Sem#2 of semiotic complexity. ere it was pointed out that “typiﬁed action schematizations may constitute minimally a ‘doing it again’ of an action performed just moments before, either by oneself or by someone else; they may also be a more situation-transcending kind of typiﬁcation that extends across particular settings, eventually spreading among members of a community or culture.” It may well be undesirable to characterize a single repetition of an action that someone else performed just a moment before as a conventionalized action, since the concept of conventionality is typically associated with (A) at least somewhat larger groups than just two people, (B) more than a single recurrence, (C) recurrence not just within, but also across, situations, and (D) a greater degree of speciﬁcation. Yet, so far as I am aware, there is no well-motivated criterion available which might provide a clue where exactly to draw the boundary between a convention proper and that which is only approaching the status of a convention. One may conclude that as a matter of empirical reality there is no strict boundary
³⁸is is not intended to imply any completely pre-determined speciﬁcation of how to interpret actions. Depending on context, the same action could be interpreted as “testing whether the electricity has come back aer a power failure”, “doing something against someone else’s will”, “following an instruction”, and so forth.
56

2.3. U   
to be found. Nevertheless, there are, of course, clear cases to be found, i.e., actions that are indisputably conventionalized.³⁹
e more explicitly conventionalized something becomes, the less personal it will be. at is, in the process of conventionalization, there is a shi from ﬁrst- and second-person intentionality to third-person intentionality, as deﬁned in Section 2.2.1. e more conventionalized an act becomes, the more it will have the meaning of what “anyone” would mean by doing the act in question. e _ gesture means “good”, not just for me, or for me and you, but for anyone that is a member of the same cultural group as us. One prime example of such third-person intentionality is the de-personalized and to some extent situation-transcending aspects of word-meaning sometimes called linguistic meaning (Coseriu, 1985) or meaning potential (Linell, 2009, Chapter 15), in contrast to the situated meanings of actual (multimodal) utterances. However, many of the more conventionalized aspects of language are not suﬃciently described simply as more or less pre-established types. A yet stronger kind of conventionalization is involved, and that takes us to Level Conv#3.
Conv#3 — Normativity
Conv#3 actions are not just recognizable, for members of some particular group, as (tokens of ) speciﬁc types of actions. At this level, actions are deemed “right” or “correct” (or “wrong”). is stronger form of conventionalization is therefore normative. Even though all the levels of conventionalization pose a certain resistance to the will of individuals (cf. social facts, Durkheim, 1965 [1895]), this is most strongly so at the higher levels of conventionality. Whereas typiﬁed conventions (Conv#2) specify ways of doing things, normative conventions (Conv#3) specify that things should be done.⁴⁰ Norms have a rule-like character. At the same time, this level implies no more than that members of a group are able to judge and treat certain ways of doing things as correct, and other ways of doing things as incorrect. ey need not be able to give any explicit account of rules as such.
One sort of normativity has to do with obligatory performance (for prescriptive norms) or obligatory non-performance (for prohibitive norms). at is to say that some actions are obligatory: whenever context X is the case, some speciﬁc type of
³⁹It may also be pointed out that it is not only the case that an action may be classiﬁed as conventional. To some extent, the performance of a conventionalized action also creates and sustains the convention.
⁴⁰It should be noted that (cf. Bach & Harnish, 1979, p. 122) do not distinguish between Conv#3 and Conv#4 normativity, in the way I do in this chapter.

act or class of actions must be produced (or must not be produced). Many aspects of grammar are of this kind (Söderbergh, 1969; Zlatev, 2007; Sinha, 2009a). “An utterance provides an obligatory context for a particular morpheme if the omission of that morpheme would result in an ungrammatical sentence, from an adult point of view”(Bates et al., 1988, p. 167). In American Sign Language (ASL) negation is signaled by manual signs performed in concert with an obligatory  (used as a grammatical marker). Children who learn ASL typically learn the manual sign  one to eight months before they start combining it with the obligatory , even though the children typically learn to use the  already at around 12 months of age, well before they learn the  sign (Anderson & Reilly, 1997). Even though the children know both the manual sign for  and the , it takes a while before they learn that the  sign creates a context X in which the performance of a  is obligatory. Context X could be just about anything, such as “everyone should rise when the King enters the room” or “bicycles are forbidden on the highway” etc.
Another sort of normativity has to do with correctness of form. In some cases, it is not obligatory to perform a certain act A just because a certain context X is present, but if act A is performed then it must take a certain form in order to be correct. Figure 2.2 shows the conventionalized  gesture.⁴¹One particular vocalization is commonly performed together with this gesture. e vocalization is optional, but if it is there it should take a certain form: for example, it should be produced through exhalation and not through inhalation. On the other hand, the gesture is
⁴¹Figure 2.2 and Figure 2.3 are posed, and not based on video recordings of a spontaneous communicative setting. Nonetheless, the gesture should be familiar to most people, at least in Sweden.

58

2.3. U   
also optional: the vocalization may also be performed alone, with a similar overall meaning. When the gesture is performed, it should have the form shown in Figure 2.2, although some variation is allowed. For example, the thumb could be folded behind the hand rather than sticking out to the side, and it would still count as a correct version of the same gesture. Some variations are not acceptable though. Figure 2.3 shows a partially incorrect version of the same gesture: the hand faces the wrong direction.⁴² In fact, the gesture performed in Figure 2.3 is at least similar to another conventionalized gesture, commonly used when contemplating something. One of the children included in this study (”Alice”) made the  gesture consistently in this way for over a year, starting some time before 18 months of age, before she eventually switched to the correct form. ⁴³ Despite her incorrect performance, the gesture was still readily recognizable as a token of the  gesture type, rather than a token of the contemplating gesture, partly due to the diﬀerent contexts of use for these two gestures and partly due to the diﬀerent vocalizations that tend to go together with them: the “shh” vocalization of the hush gesture versus a vocalizations such as “hum”, ”hmm” and “uhmm” for the contemplating gesture. Last but not least, the similarity of this gestural performance to the correct performance, although only partial, also plays a role in identifying this gesture as an instance of the  gesture. In this way, a given action need not be fully compliant with the idealized norm, for the conventional and normative aspects to provide an interpretative ame.
Furthermore, not all deviation from prototypical performances of conventionalized and normatively regulated actions are “incorrect” in the same way. For the signs of signed languages that are not only conventionalized, but also at least partially iconic, variations in performance with respect to the prototypical form of the sign are judged as less bad when the variations are compatible with the iconic dimension of the gesture (Arendsen, 2009, p. 94).⁴⁴ Some variations are still considered appropriate due to other grounds for meaning than the conventionalized aspect of the sign. In the end, “pragmatic” appropriateness overrides normative correctness whenever there is a conﬂict between the two (Coseriu, 1985). Generally, so long as some communicative actions are considered appropriate to a given situation, there will be no objections, no matter how incorrect they are. To conclude, normativ-
⁴²is partial incorrectness is not entirely unlike how children sometimes write letters in reverse direction (mirrored) before they learn that the orientation is part of the normative constraints on writing.
⁴³In a study of Swedish children, the word (or vocalization) “shh” was in the repertoire of at least 20% of the 16 months old children (Eriksson & Berglund, 1998, p. 15).
⁴⁴Arendsen also found that individuals varied in their tolerance.

C 2: ”W  ?”    
ity and conventionality provide an interpretative frames, but their primary job may not be so much to validate or invalidate actions per se (many errors are tolerated in practice), but rather to facilitate interpersonal processes of interpretation.
Conv#4 — Explicated rules⁴⁵
At this level, members of a group not only have intuitions of correctness, they also formulate rules and norms explicitly, as objects of communication and thought in their own right. Hence, at this level normative aspects of action become products in their own right. In the most explicit case, these rules may even exist in written form, as prescriptions (cf. formalization, Andrén, Sanne & Linell, 2010, p. 224; Linell, 2009, p. 210), such as juridical laws, traﬃc rules, or the Ten Commandments. Other variants include conversational asides about some aspect of proper conduct, and signposts, such as stop signs, that have an explicit rule as their core meaning: for the stop sign, a rule that is known by anyone who drives a car. At Level Conv#4, the rules are not simply part of conduct, but are to some extent independent of the actions they refer to. In cases where the rule is communicated prior to the performance of an action, as a “pre-scription”, the rule resembles an instruction, even though instructions are not necessarily normative in character.
e distinction between Level Conv#3 and Conv#4 regarding the explicitness of the convention need not entail the presence of the “ought-ness” of normativity (Conv#3). It is also possible to give explicit accounts of other forms of conventionality (i.e., Conv#1 and Conv#2). e presentation here of four diﬀerent levels is a mixture of two separate continua: a continuum of increasing explicitness of the conventions and another of increasing “ought-ness” (normativity) of the conventions. One could even add a third continuum of increasing sizes of the communities that share a convention (two persons, a handful, the people of a country, humanity, or some other point along this line). To construe these diﬀerent aspects of conventionality in terms of a single continuum, as done here, is therefore a compromise, but one that is suﬃcient for the purposes of this thesis. Even though the oughtness introduced in Conv#3 and the the explicitness of Conv#4 refer to some extent to diﬀerent continua, the distinction of this fourth level from the third in this way helps clarifying the fact that “knowing a grammar” or some other normatively regulated phenomenon can be understood in quite diﬀerent ways. It can be under-
⁴⁵I am grateful to Jordan Zlatev for the suggestion to include this fourth level in the conceptual scheme. Its inclusion makes the nature of Conv#3 clearer, as I intended it, by showing how it is distinct from Conv#4.
60

2.3. U   
stood pre-reﬂectivly and implicitly (Conv#3 and lower), or reﬂectively and explicitly (Conv#4). A stronger form of explicitness provides one of the ways in which ought-ness becomes stronger, as in the case of law books or the Ten Commandments.
An interesting aspect of prescribed actions, where the rules exist separately of the actions and activities that they refer to, is that one might learn these actions (at least partially) through learning the rules that are associated with them, rather than by observing others performing the actions, or by inventing the structure of the action oneself.⁴⁶Tomasello & Barton (1994) have shown that at least at 24 months of age, children comprehend enough language to be able to learn to use some words directly by being told what the words mean, rather than by hearing the word in an ostensive context where the referent is concretely present. e separation of rules from the actions that they refer to also means that the reliance on recurrence as an underlying factor in this form of conventionality may be very weak, or even nonexistent. at is, one may make up rules for a game that has never been played before, so that there is not yet any recurrent phenomenon in existence to which the rule may refer. In such cases the rules are indeed “pre-scribed”. Accordingly, one might distinguish between stipulated “pre-scribed” rules (a top-down process) and rules that attempt to formulate the inherent normativity and regularities of already existing phenomena (a bottom-up process).⁴⁷
e depersonalized character of conventionality
As argued above, the more explicitly conventionalized certain phenomena become, in increasingly larger communities, the less personal they get. Normativity (Conv#3) and explicated rules (Conv#4), as deﬁned here, are not primarily matters of ﬁrst and second-person intentionality, but rather strong forms of third-person intentionality. erefore, in addition to the ‘I’ and ‘you’ in interpersonal relations and communicative encounters, “we could think of the language, including the meaning potentials of all its lexical resources, as belonging to an ‘invisible third party’ […], or a
⁴⁶en again, in order to understand an instruction, one must know what the words that make up the instruction refer to, which nevertheless points back to embodied experiences of action. Still, the embodied experience which is required here is not of the same sort, and a rule may very well describe an action of a particular sort that has not been experienced before, and the rule may also add the ought-ness aspect to the actions that the rule is concerned with, which may not have been there before the formulation of the rule.
⁴⁷See also Searle (1995, p. 27) for a similar but not identical distinction between “regulative rules”, which adds some sort of regulation to an already existing activity, and “constitutive rules”, that create new activities that did not exist before the stipulation of the rule.
61

C 2: ”W  ?”    
generalized other”, that concerns “how ‘we’ or ‘one’ [or generic ‘you’] would use the words in the common language” (Linell, 2009, p. 95; see also Salgado & Hermans, 2005 and Mead, 1934). At the same time, of course in the use of language and in other more or less conventionalized expressions, ﬁrst and second-person intentionality are also present: actions are constituted by personal will and by adaption to particular unique situations and recipients. For participants in interactions, norms and conventions provide resources that they may orient to, for the sake of order, rationality, and comprehensibility, rather than being strictly governed by them (i.e., the problem of agency versus structure in sociology). e acknowledgment of all three intentional perspectives (see Section 2.2.1) in communicative action provides a framework that accounts for the nature of communication both as an initiating expression of the self, as a responsive adaptation to the Other in a social encounter, as well as a re-articulation of more situation-transcending cultural patterns, including language and conventionalized aspects of gesture.
Finally, one may ask: are norms something more than the “sum, average or common denominator of all the individual beliefs” (Sinha, 2009a, p. 301) of the members of a group? As Sinha argues, in a way they are: most conventions, in their various forms, pre-date the individual’s lifespan (cf. Schutz, 1932; Heidegger, 1962 [1927]; Linell 2009, p. 57), providing an already structured world that the child will eventually be able to appropriate and exploit. Hence, many if not most conventions exist in a way that does not depend on any speciﬁc individual. At the same time, even though conventions (or “social facts”, in Sinha’s terminology, borrowing it from Durkheim, 1965 [1895]) are “in some way prior to individual cognitions about them […] it cannot be claimed that social facts are independent of cognitions, in this case of social cognitions, since their normative status is dependent upon agreement in cognition” (Sinha, 2009a, p. 301).
2.3.4 Combinations
One characteristic property of language, according to most deﬁnitions, is that its expressive units may combine to form more complex meanings, such as propositions. Children’s communicative development is oen characterized in terms of preverbal, one-word, and combinatorial (or two-word) developmental stages (a multi-word utterance stage), or in a similar vein, as development through presymbolic, symbolic, and propositional stages (cf. Lock, 1997). Peters (1983) uses the expressions oneunit and multi-unit stages rather than one-word and two-word stages, since the
62

2.3. U   
units of production (especially in children) may not always correspond to “words”.⁴⁸ e combinatorial, or propositional, stage is then typically considered to be that stage which corresponds to the achievement of language proper, although there may still be a long way to go until truly adult-like speech is achieved in all its concrete detail and abstract generalizations, including structural aspects like discourse level structure. e combinatorial, or propositional, stage emerges some time during the second year of life, although there is considerable individual variation (Bates et al., 1988). Some authors make a further distinction between a developmental stage of combinatorial sequences of units and a further developmental stage of hierarchically ordered sequences (e.g. McCune, 1995).
It should be stressed that combining two expressive “units” into a larger whole is not synonymous with grammar, in the sense of conventionalized and, to a large extent, normatively regulated word order patterns. It is perfectly possible to combine expressive units in a creative and non-conventionalized fashion, which would not count as grammar in the strict linguistic sense. is means that the issue of “combinations” is to be found both below the upper limit of gesture, and above the upper limit, as part of the conventionalized grammar of the language. e words “combine” and “combination” are used in a number of other ways in the scientiﬁc discourse, more or less related to each other, and the aim of the present section is to clarify some of these diﬀerent uses.
When gesture and speech are used in a coordinated fashion it is oen said that they are “combined” with each other. Several studies distinguish between unimodal combinations within a single modality (word+word or gesture+gesture) and bimodal combinations across modalities (word+gesture) (e.g. Greenﬁeld & Smith, 1976; Greenﬁeld et al., 1985; Goldin-Meadow & Morford, 1985; Capirci et al., 1996; Butcher & Goldin-Meadow, 2000; Pizzuto et al., 2005; Guidetti, 2005; Iverson et al., 2008; Stefanini et al., 2009). One conclusion that comes out of this line of research is that hearing-enabled children produce many more gesture+word and word+word combinations than gesture+gesture combinations (e.g. Goldin-Meadow & Morford, 1990; Capirci et al., 1996, 2005; Stefanini et al., 2009), and in most cases when gestures are combined, one or both of the gestures are deictic rather than content-loaded (e.g. Volterra, 1981; Masur, 1983; Petitto, 1988; Goldin-Meadow
⁴⁸e notion of “developmental stages” can be, and has been, interpreted in many diﬀerent ways (cf. Zlatev & Andrén, 2009). For example, does a developmental stage begin when the ﬁrst few instances of some criterial property appears, or does it begin when the average utterance of a child possesses the criterial property? Does the new developmental stage replace an earlier stage, or is the new stage rather building on top of the previous one rather than replacing it? Are the transitions between stages a matter of gradual change, or are they more like sudden reorganizations?

& Morford, 1990; Morford & Goldin-Meadow, 1992; Capirci et al., 1996). Several studies have also shown that gesture+speech combinations reliably predict the onset of word+word combinations at around 17 to 22 months of age, i.e., twoword speech (Capirci et al., 1996; Butcher & Goldin-Meadow, 2000; Iverson et al., 2008). at conclusion does not regard all gesture+speech combinations though, but rather more speciﬁcally those combinations in which the content/referent of the gesture and word are not complementary (e.g. holding up an empty glass while saying “glass”), but supplementary (e.g. holding up an empty glass while saying “juice”).⁴⁹ Typically the gesture involved in a supplementary combination is deictic rather than content-loaded. Supplementary combinations are eﬀectively multimodal predicates, emerging a few months before the ability to express such meanings purely within the vocal modality.
Another distinction to make is between serial combinations: sequential “strings” of words or gestures; and parallel combinations: simultaneous expressions that overlap in time. Both types of combinations can take place within and across modalities. An example of serial combination across modalities are gestures that ﬁll a grammatical “slot” in a spoken utterance (cf. mixed syntax, Slama-Cazacu, 1976), such as saying “he went…” and directly aer the word “went” pointing in a certain direction. In such cases, even non-conventionalized gestures may function as if they were “words”, in a relatively autonomous fashion, as pointed out earlier in this chapter.⁵⁰Note that while both gesture+word, and gesture+gesture combinations may be performed in the same instant, i.e., as parallel combinations, word+word combinations can not be produced in parallel (at least not in any existing spoken language).⁵¹
It is not obvious where exactly to draw the line between what is to be considered a parallel simultaneous combination and what is to be considered a serial one. Diﬀerent authors draw the line diﬀerently, depending in parts on their research in-
⁴⁹It is not completely straightforward how to determine whether a gesture means “the same thing” as some particular word. See Pizzuto et al. (2005, p. 229) for a discussion of some of the diﬀerences in how this has been interpreted by various researchers.
⁵⁰McNeill (2007, p. 22) has recently extended his scale from non-conventionalized gesticulation to conventionalized signed language to include such cases of ‘mixed syntax’ (he calls them language slotted gestures), as a slightly more language-like gesture than the class of gestures that he calls ‘gesticulation’. Also, Ladewig (2010) is currently working on a PhD thesis on the topic of mixed syntax.
⁵¹It may be speculated that the onset of gesture+speech combinations before speech+speech combinations might have something to do with the fact that speech+speech combinations require the expression to be laid out in a temporally extended and sequential manner (cf. the linearization problem, Levelt, 1980, 1981), while gesture+speech combinations may be expressed, as it were, simultaneously.
64

terests. Researchers with a psycholinguistic interest in gesture may be interested in very precise measurements of gesture+speech timing, either on a scale of milliseconds (cf. McNeill & Levy, 1982, p. 284; Seyfeddinipur, 2006) or on a syllable level (Gullberg et al., 2008, p. 213). Others use more liberal criteria. For example, Guidetti (2002, p. 273) uses a criterion according to which the gesture and the word (or possibly also non-linguistic vocalization) are labeled as a gesture+word or a gesture+vocalization combination if the gesture and the speech occur within two seconds of each other. Blake (2000, p. 98) uses a criterion with a maximum gap of one second. ese more “liberal” criteria may seem rough from a psycholinguistic point of view, but it should be noted that a word and gesture may well appear to “occur together”, or at least “belong together”, even though they are not performed in exact coordination in terms of objective time. Neither of these two approaches should therefore be considered the one and only “correct” one. Diﬀerent criteria for what should count as a parallel (simultaneous, synchronous) gesture-speech combination capture diﬀerent aspects of the temporal relations between gesture and speech.
Related to the distinction between an “objective” and “experiential” level of characterizing combinations is the distinction between combination in a temporal sense, and in a semantic sense. While a gesture may be performed in temporal overlap with some speciﬁc word, it may be the case that the semantics of the gesture relates to another word, or of several words of which the gesture only co-occurs with a subset. e lexical aﬃliate (Schegloﬀ, 1984), i.e., the “semantic partner” of a gesture, may or may not be the word(s) with which the gesture co-occurs.
ere is a debate in research on children’s gestures over whether simultaneous gesture+speech combinations exist from the outset, or whether there is ﬁrst a developmental period where gestures and speech are performed independently of one another before they eventually “come together”. ere is evidence in favor both of the early integration scenario (Masataka, 2003; Iverson & elen, 1999; Capirci et al., 2005; Pizzuto et al., 2005), and of the late integration scenario (Butcher & Goldin-Meadow, 2000; McNeill, 2005; Rowe et al., 2008). Some studies suggest an interpretation somewhere in between (Guidetti, 2002; Rodrigo et al., 2004). e answers to this debate depend in part on whether gesture+vocalization (rather than gesture+word), movement+vocalization, and movement+word are to be considered to be “integration”, or only gesture (proper) + word (proper). e answer depends as well on whether the issue concerns deictic or “representational” gestures and deictic or “representational” words (Pizzuto et al., 2005). In any case, the children studied in this thesis all clearly combine words and gestures at the ﬁrst obser-
65

C 2: ”W  ?”    
vations (18 months), such combinations including supplementary as well as complementary combination. At the same time, given that the beginning of the period studied in this thesis overlaps with the end of some of the studies on gesture+speech integration, some comparisons can be made (see Chapter 5).
One may further distinguish between combinations in an additive sense, where two complementary meaning units are added to bring about a larger meaning unit, and combinations where the units acquire syntagmatic values: i.e., “values they don’t have outside the combination — as ‘direct object’ is the value of a noun only in opposition to a verb, combined in a verb phrase” (McNeill & Sowa, 2007).
At a more fundamental level, one may also consider what it means to say that diﬀerent aspects of a bimodal expression are “combined”. To say that anything is a “combination” implies that there are ﬁrst two separate “units”, and that these are subsequently “put together”. From an analytical point of view it is of course possible to treat any identiﬁable aspects of an expression as separable, so that it may well be warranted to speak of these as diﬀerent elements that are “combined”. Nevertheless, to use the word “combination” for all coordinated uses of gesture and speech hides some of the variation that exists in the ways that gesture and speech may be said to be combined. So one may distinguish between combinations proper which are the result of putting together two or more units that have a well-deﬁned status on their own, and those which may not be best thought of as combinations at all, but rather as multimodal wholes. e issue of multimodal wholes is the topic of Section 8.3, where it will be argued that in some cases the relationship between gesture and speech may be one of a multimodal whole, and more speciﬁcally, that the relationship is sometimes that of a conventionalized multimodal whole. Such instances will be referred as item-based multimodal constructions, that phrase being inspired by construction grammar and other usage-based approaches to language (e.g. Tomasello, 2001, 2003). Multimodal constructions are to be understood as holophrastic phenomena that extend across modalities. e existence of such conventionalized multimodal wholes puts into question any theory that posits a necessary opposition between the semiotic modes of co-speech gesture and speech, according to which the mode of expression involved in co-speech gestures is fundamentally diﬀerent from the mode of expression of the words that it accompanies.

2.4 Putting the pieces back together again
So, what is gesture? What I hope to have made clear so far is that there is a long list of properties involved behind the scenes, as it were, in what might at ﬁrst glance appear as relatively simple and intuitive demarcations between gesture and nongesture, with respect to both the upper and lower limit of gesture. Rather than identifying gesture with a single set of characterizing properties, a comparative semiotic approach will be taken here (cf. Kendon, 2008), serving highlight both diﬀerences and similarities between diﬀerent kinds of gestural performances. Arguably, this results in an understanding of the notion of “gesture” as a matter of family resemblance (Wittgenstein, 1953). Such a conception of gesture, I believe, is not vaguer than what is oﬀered by more unitary and seemingly well-deﬁne conceptions of gesture, but to the contrary, more precise. Gestural performances then need to be speciﬁed with a more ﬁne-grained set of properties. e task then becomes to identify interesting dimensions of variation that may be used to characterize and compare diﬀerent gestural performances (Kendon, 2004, p. 104). Metaphorically speaking, the notion of gesture can be thought of as a cake that can be divided in diﬀerent ways depending on how it is analyzed; but the cake itself, as it is discussed in the gesture literature, is an aggregate of several diﬀerent features that may vary with respect to each other. It would be misguided to try to treat all those actions that are referred to as “gesture” as one category of action with a singular and essential core. Table 2.1 summarizes the main terms and distinctions that have been made in this chapter.
Although clear distinctions between diﬀerent modes of expression are beneﬁcial for clarity and descriptive precision, they may sometimes have a tendency to obscure similarities that exist, empirically, across the distinguished phenomena in actually occurring actions, so that the conceptual distinctions that one has made result in certain blind spots. Blind spots may emerge from other conceptual dichotomies, apart from the issues that have been discussed in this chapter, such as the distinction between pragmatics and grammar where “pragmatics” tends to serve as a waste-basket for everything that does not ﬁt into narrow accounts of grammar as a self-contained domain. On such a view, little consideration is given to how grammar and pragmatic issues are interrelated.⁵² In a similar vein, Haviland (1998, p.
⁵²For example, one might ask how structural properties of grammar are motivated in terms of their (recurrent) deployment within the relevancies related to the turn-taking of communicative interaction. Fortunately, this issue has received more attention in recent years (Ochs et al., 1996;

communication, and so on. e standard procedure is to deﬁne one term strictly and exclusively, and to relegate to the other everything le over once the strictly deﬁned parts have been subtracted from the phenomena in question.
In order to reconcile the apparent conﬂict between clear conceptual distinctions and overly dichotomous ways of treating empirical phenomena I have attempted, in this chapter, to go in the direction of a more ﬁne-grained conceptual apparatus, and avoid any simplistic binary distinction between “gesture” and “non-gesture”. Although this maneuver does not get rid of the problem of “subtractive thinking” altogether, it will make the subtractive error smaller. Even though the distinctions that are made will still serve to emphasize diﬀerences between the distinguished entities, there will in eﬀect be a richer set of options for capturing nuances. At the same time, this maneuver retains the (necessary, I would argue) beneﬁts of a clearly deﬁned analytic vocabulary. Indeed, without retaining some trust in the value of clear conceptual distinctions, it would be hard to bring any clarity to issues of similarities and diﬀerences in the ﬁrst place since there would never be any determinable shi from “similar” to “diﬀerent”, but only vague continua. e crucial issue here is not to think of distinctions on a conceptual level as discrete phenomena on an empirical level. at is, even if the issues of the lower limit of gesture may not be a matter of a continuous scale on a conceptual level, it may certainly be so on an empirical level: any particular gestural actions may exhibit more or less of the properties pinpointed by the conceptual distinctions. It is precisely this emphasis on both similarities and diﬀerences that a more ﬁne-grained set of conceptual distinctions makes possible, thereby avoiding any undue emphasis on diﬀerences alone (with the associated blind spots that emerge from confusing conceptual distinctions with empirical phenomena) or on gradual continua alone (with the consequent problem of providing clear analytical accounts due to the lack of conceptual distinctions), that constitutes the comparative semiotic perspective. Although this chapter has been presented in isolation from any empirical data, all of the conceptual distinctions that have been oﬀered are motivated by observations resulting from the analysis of the data to be described in Part II of this thesis.

3.1 Structures of action
Gesture is a kind of action. As such, gestures share a number of properties with other forms of acting. For example, all actions are by deﬁnition meaningful in some way, to be distinguished from involuntary movements or “mere movement”. Formulated in terms of one of the distinctions introduced in the previous chapter, that is to say that both action in general and gesture in particular cannot be suﬃciently accounted for by thin descriptions of observable conduct (meaningless form), but rather presuppose thick (intentional, meaningful) descriptions (cf. Ryle, 1968). At the same time, the particular ways in which a gesture or an action is performed play

a crucial role in shaping what a gesture or an action may come to mean or be about. Furthermore, what a gesture or an action may mean or be about also depends on the overall activity that they are a part of. Hence the meaning of a gesture or an action is not solely attributable to form properties of the gestural performance itself. Such relations between form and function, and between acts and activities, will be discussed in this chapter in terms of the “formula” of operation-act-activity interdependence.
Another similarity between gesture and other ways of acting is that they are typically experienced as coherent wholes that have some sort of beginning and end, even in cases where this happens in a continuous stream of movement. is can be traced both to aspects of the movement dynamics involved in the performance of the act or gesture (cf. Baldwin et al., 2008), as well as to the possibility to attribute meaning to them (cf. cf. Hendriks-Jansen, 1996), oen in terms of culturally deﬁned meanings. Kendon (1978, 1980b, 2004) has introduced a descriptive vocabulary of gesture phases, which enables a description of gestures relating to issues such as specifying when they begin and when they end, i.e., to specify what part(s) of a stretch of movement(s) that stand out from prior and subsequent movements as the articulation of a gesture. is terminological apparatus is essential to descriptions of gesture and it will also be described and discussed brieﬂy in this chapter.
Since most gestures and many actions take place in social contexts, it is also relevant to consider the relation between action and intersubjectivity, i.e., action as a way of being together. Indeed, infants do not encounter the world alone. is means that the development of action cannot be understood merely as a matter of sensorimotor interaction between an organism and the world without regard to the (active) role of the social Other in this process. In research on children’s development, children’s abilities to understand other people are oen conceptualized in terms of eory of Mind (ToM) (e.g. Leslie, 1987; Baron-Cohen et al., 1985; Baron-Cohen, 1995). Simply put, this approach posits that children have a particular inferential mechanism fully developed by the age of 3 which enables them to understand the intentionality of other people more or less “across the board”, as if it did not matter how the interaction is carried out and what sort of activity that is involved. e analytic route chosen for the purposes of this thesis does not conform to this conceptualization. is issue will be discussed ﬁrst, before turning to operation-act-activity nexus, actions gestalts, and gesture phases.

3.2 Action, intersubjectivity and the world within reach
Alfred Schutz was concerned with establishing a phenomenology of the natural attitude in the activities of everyday life.¹ As part of this endeavor he provided an analysis of the world within my reach (Schutz, 1945), and its intersubjective properties. “e world within reach” refers to the world as experienced through the senses as well as kinaesthetic, locomotive, and operative movements that “gear out into the world”.² His analysis of this particular part of the life-world was inspired by George Herbert Mead (1932, 1938) who distinguished between the manipulatory area and more distal zones that were perceivable, but not within the range of direct action. Schutz regarded the manipulatory area as being of utmost importance. In fact, he describes it as “the kernel of the reality of the life-world” (Schutz & Luckmann, 1973, p. 42; see also Schutz, 1945, p. 546), and it is in this primordial reality that the newborn child will ﬁnd itself.
Although terms such as “zone”, “sphere”, and “area” may suggest that this zone is primarily a spatial and topological zone, this is not only so. e manipulatory area is also endowed with the temporal experiential character of the present, including various relations to past experiences and future possibilities in terms such as “the world within potential reach”, “the world within restorable reach” (as opposed to “the world within reach” and “the world within actual reach”) and through temporally situated motives such as doing things “in order to” (the action performed in order to achieve a future result) or “because of ” (the action as motivated by some previous state of aﬀairs). As such, the concept of the world within reach is framed in a solid spatio-temporal and experiential framework.
e most crucial aspect of Schutz’ (and Mead’s) analyses of the zone of operation, however, is that it does not only concern the relation between the subject and the world. It is also a highly social zone that includes involvement with other people. is essential acknowledgment stands in contrast to a number of other accounts of the relation between the subject and the world, such as, for example, Johnson’s (1987) “body in the mind” (see Linell, 2009 for a relevant critique), the “ecological” framework of Gibson (1979) (see Costall, 1995 for a relevant critique), and the sensorimotor account account of perception of Noë (2004) (see Gallagher, 2008 for a relevant critique). Although all of these accounts emphasize the role of action and sensorimotor interaction with the world in human sense-making and concept
¹e notion of the natural attitude was also discussed in Section 2.2.1. ²“Within reach” is a translation from the German word erreichbar and it seems to be the standard translation of Schutz’ term.

formation, all of them lack a developed notion of social action. Schutz paid close attention to the partly overlapping, and partly disjoint, character of participants’ experiences and perspectives in face-to-face encounters, carefully working out, for example, the consequential nature of the distinction between what is here for me is there for you, and vice versa.³ Questions of intersubjectivity constitute the very heart of Schutz’ theoretical enterprise.
In the literature that does stress the importance of intersubjectivity for the understanding of human action and interaction one can, ideally speaking, discern two “poles” regarding how the problem of intersubjectivity is construed.⁴ e ﬁrst pole consists of approaches to intersubjectivity that start out with the solipsistic assumption of “no access”. According to this position, minds ﬁrst exist in separation, and some sort of mental bridge is required to close this “gap”. Typically, in such accounts, it is “minds” or “brains”, rather than situated and acting persons or bodies, that make intersubjectivity possible, and emphasis lies on domain-general inferential mechanisms (the “inferential model of communication”, Sperber & Wilson, 1995 [1986];eory of Mind (ToM), Baron-Cohen et al., 1985; Baron-Cohen, 1995; Leslie, 1987; and to some extent the relatively detached notion “shared intentionality infrastructure” proposed by Tomasello, 2008). is results in a conceptualization of the problem of interpersonal understanding which is more or less “content-free” in the sense that no reference is made to the child’s more speciﬁc previous experiences of engagement in a multitude of speciﬁc activities. at is, the eory of Mind conceptualization of the problem of interpersonal understanding assumes that interpersonal understanding is a unitary phenomenon. It may be informative to note that Schutz speaks, not of “interpersonal understanding” in this generalized way, but of “knowledge of other minds” (my italics, see Schutz, 1954), and more speciﬁcally, that this knowledge is described as a “stock of knowledge” (my italics, Schutz & Luckmann, 1973) that involves familiarity with a heterogeneous array of activities. As remarked by Zahavi (2010), the Schutzian position involves the recognition that there is not just one form of interpersonal understanding, but many, and in a similar way, Sharrock & Coulter (2009, p. 87) argue that:
‘Understanding other people’ is no unitary task, accomplished in any
³Kendon (1990, p. 211) presents a similar notion in a discussion of spatial organization in communication. When an individual’s transactional segment (the space into which a participant looks and speaks, into which he reaches to handle objects) overlap with another individuals transactional segment in a joint transactional segment (an o-space), we can speak of a jointly regulated F-formation (a stable spatial arrangement of a focused encounter).
⁴See Gallagher (2004) and Zlatev et al. (2008b) for similarly structured arguments regarding theorizing on intersubjectivity.

one way, by any single ‘mechanism’, but is a multifarious one, and it is perhaps the tendency to think of this in an almost wholly abstract way [e.g. “eory of Mind”] which creates the false impression that it is a single, well-deﬁned aﬀair.
e second pole consists of approaches that start out with an assumption of “direct access” to the Other. According to this position, it is a mistake to think that persons are “separate” from each other in the ﬁrst place, when they are in fact physically and experientially available to each other, including emotional expression and the like. ese approaches generally emphasize some form of “direct perception” of the Other and it is mainly within the phenomenological tradition that such accounts are found. For Jean-Paul Sartre (according to Schutz, 1948, p. 191), “Expressive gestures in particular, do not indicate a hidden aﬀect lived through by any psyche. e frowning brows, the clenched ﬁsts, etc., do not indicate the Other’s wrath; they are his wrath.” Max Scheler defends a similar view:
For we certainly believe ourselves to be directly acquainted with another person’s joy in his laughter, with his sorrow and pain in his tears, with his shame in his blushing, with his entreaty in his outstretched hands... And with the tenor of this thoughts in the sound of his words. If anyone tells me that this is not ”perception”, for it cannot be so, in view of the fact that a perception is simply a ”complex of physical sensations” ... I would beg him to turn aside from such questionable theories and address himself to the phenomenological facts. (Scheler, 1954, cited in Gallagher, 2005, p. 228; see also Gallagher, 2004; Zlatev et al., 2008b)
is way of formulating the problem avoids some of the problems associated with the previous approach — the “no access” approach — because it does not disregard the concrete ways in which interpersonal understanding comes about as a result of actually being together. However, this approach also comes with its own problems. First of all, the outcome of such views are sometimes dangerously close to accounting for intersubjectivity merely by saying that it is not a “problem” in the ﬁrst place. at may be true to some extent, from the viewpoint of participants in routine activities in the natural attitude, but it is not necessarily productive from a scientiﬁc point of view to merely take intersubjectivity for granted. It is also dangerously close to a behaviorist position — Schutz (1948) also points this out — in which the mental life of a subject at any given moment is reduced to what is visible from the surface of the person’s body. is problem is sometimes confused for the issue of Cartesianism. Just because we may not want to separate “mind” from body, in

a Cartesian way, we do not want to commit the mistake of reducing the mental to that which is visible on the surface of the body in each given moment, neither from a scientiﬁc point of view, nor as a description of how participants orient to each other. According to the way Schutz construes the “problem” of intersubjectivity, however, we are neither in a position of “no access” to each other, nor do we have “direct access” to the inner worlds of each other. e way he formulates the problem is productive in the sense that it locates a phenomenon which is massively available for analysis, each time human beings engage with each other (which is not to say that other ways of studying intersubjectivity must be excluded).
What we have “between” us, according to Schutz, is the mundane social world of everyday life itself. A central resource for the achievement of order in this everyday life is the various typiﬁed means for coping with this life. is includes typiﬁed means of interpretation (typical motives) and typiﬁed ways of acting.⁵ Schutz (1955, p. 173) states that “fully successful communication” is not possible, but that “e common-sense praxis of everyday life, however, solves this problem to such an extent that for nearly all good and useful purposes we can establish communication with our fellow-men and come to terms with them.” Further, he points out that this is only possible if the communicative process is based on a set of typiﬁcations, abstractions, and standardizations. us, he locates the problem of intersubjectivity right in the middle of the spatio-temporal, personal, and mundane contingencies of everyday life in all its particulars.
When we act, in Schutz’ account, we act in ways that are sensitive to — or “orient to” in ethnomethodological parlance (cf. Seedhouse, 2007) — more or less standardized, tried-out-before, and typiﬁed ways of acting (rather than being strictly governed by them). We do this because it works, and because others can understand us when we do so. We also understand, to a large extent, actions of others in terms of such standardized motives and typiﬁed rationalities (Schutz, 1953), i.e., the third-person intentional perspective that was discussed in Chapter 2. rough the socially shared (i.e., conventionalized) character of such typiﬁed understandings of action we are able to achieve and maintain a social order that is suﬃcient for the “pragmatic” purposes at hand.⁶ is is not to say that all sense-making in face-

⁶is way of thinking was picked up by Harold Garﬁnkel, the founder of ethnomethodology, and made into a central point of departure of this school. According to ethnomethodological thinking social life is organized with respect to being “visibly-rational-and-reportable-for-all-practicalpurposes” (1967, p. vii). Garﬁnkel’s (1952) PhD thesis was concerned with providing an account of social order that to a large extent based on some of Schutz’ ideas, although he was also partly critical

to-face encounters is a matter of what I have dubbed third-person intentionality. If that was the case, it would be hard to account for how (interpersonal) understanding of action in terms of third-person intentionality could emerge in the ﬁrst place, unless it rested on more basic forms of social interaction of a not-yet-typiﬁed character (e.g. Trevarthen, 1979).⁷ Indeed, it is in the more direct we-relationship of the face-to-face encounter and the world within reach that children ﬁnd themselves from the very outset (Schutz, 1967 [1932], 1966, p. 80). It should be noted, though, that even in the face-to-face encounter Schutz did not uncritically accept the idea of perception of the other as “direct”, as the “direct access” account of intersubjectivity would have it, also from a phenomenological perspective (Schutz & Luckmann, 1973, pp. 63):
Although we speak of the ”immediate” experience of a fellow-man, this experience is internally, also in the precise meaning of the word, ”mediated.” I grasp my fellow-man’s ﬂow of lived experiences only ”mediately,” in that I explicate his movements, his expression, his communications as indications of the subjectively meaningful experiences of an alter ego. But among all my experiences of the other I, what is mediated least is the encounter of the fellow-man in the simultaneity of the we-relation. us we will continue to speak, even though it is not completely accurate, of an immediate experience of the fellow-man.
Also, the further away from the world within actual reach that interpersonal interaction gets (telephone calls, conversation through written text, etc), the more indirect it will be, with a stronger dependence on indirect processes based solely on “already established” typiﬁcation, such as conventionalized language, standardized acts and activities, including the ways in which we typify our own conduct in institutional settings in the sense of “acting like the typical sender of a letter” or “acting like a typical customer in the grocery store” and similar depersonalized ways of acting (Schutz & Luckmann, 1973; see also Barker, 1978).
Before ending this section it should be pointed out that even though at last some of these typiﬁcations may be considered “mere constructions” and may have “ﬂaws” such as being counterfactual, this does not make them somehow unreal and irrelevant for explanations of human action. is is captured in the so-called omas theorem according to which “If men deﬁne situations as real, they are real in their

otic complexity (Sem#1) in Section 2.2.3.

consequences” (omas, 1928, p. 572; see also Schutz, 1955, p. 194; Bruner, 1990). A variant of the same idea is central to the perspective of symbolic interactionism (Blumer, 1969), according to which human beings do not act in direct response to the actions of others, but rather towards the meanings they ascribe to those actions, which means that held beliefs, no matter if they are counterfactual or not, will have very real consequences. In fact, it is precisely the property of conventions (i.e., “social constructions”) of constituting a (shared) choice in a somewhat “arbitrary” and open-ended set of possibilities of cultural beliefs that will eventually allow people to align themselves with each other in more complex forms of mutual understanding.
To conclude, in the Schutzian perspective of intersubjectivity and interpersonal understanding that is adopted here, there is a strong role for social processes of typiﬁcation in the achievement of social order and interpersonal understanding, and as a consequence, also in scientiﬁc explanations of these phenomena. In particular, social processes give rise to third-person intentionality, which is perhaps the single most important factor underlying the possibility of interpersonal understanding of a more general kind since it concerns knowledge of what people typically intend when they do such and such. at is, when we express ourselves, we typically do this, at least in part, via depersonalized typiﬁcations. ird-person intentionality is by its very nature not something that can be achieved or understood purely by abstract “inference” on behalf of an “isolated” individual, as the “no access” accounts of intersubjectivity would have it, since it is rather based on what Schutz calls a “the stock of knowledge at hand”, which in turn presupposes prior pragmatic engagement with others in a heterogeneous multitude of diﬀerent activities. On the other hand, the “direct access” accounts of intersubjectivity do not provide a satisfactory explanation either. For example, they do not explain why children do not “already” understand all aspects of social life more or less from day one, or at least from the moment when they ﬁrst perceive them, since these accounts assume a nonproblematic model of communication.
As argued by Linell (2009, pp. 81), “the term ‘intersubjectivity’ can either be taken in a sense that stresses commonality, sharedness and perhaps consensus, or it can be understood in a more neutral sense of mutual other-orientedness that can also accommodate alterity”. at is, the understanding of intersubjectivity that is adopted here is in line with the latter interpretation of the term, in which it takes active engagement in social interaction to achieve mutual understanding, both in speciﬁc situations, but even more so on a longer ontogenetic time-span. De Jaegher (2008, p. 541) comes to the same conclusion and summarizes it like this:
Others are not opaque to us. But they are also not continually trans-
78

parent to us. We still work at understanding them. But rather than doing that from our strictly individual vantage point, we do it in interaction (and sometimes we collaborate towards this goal, and sometimes we don’t).
In this regard it should also be added that “the idea is not that we simultaneously come to the same understanding of any given situation (although this can happen)” (Duranti, 2010, p. 6). e way intersubjectivity is understood in this thesis is therefore as something which is more basic than “mutual understanding” as it is rather the conditions that make mutual understanding possible. As I would argue then, these conditions are constituted precisely by the possibility of “throwing oneself into” (or indeed already being in) engagement in joint activities, not as detached puzzle solvers, but through actual engagement. Indeed, “since we are caught up in such pragmatic circumstances from the very beginning (consider for example the infant’s dependency on others for nourishment), the original situation cannot be characterized as an isolated subject confronting an alien being” (Gallagher, 2004, p. 31).
is way of viewing intersubjectivity is “premised on the abandonment of the search for any pristine ‘fail-safe’ technique through which [interpersonal understanding] could be said to be assured or guaranteed” (Heritage, 1984, p. 54; see also Wittgenstein, 1953) and instead takes an interest in how it is achieved in, and possible through, semiotic processes of action.
3.3 Manual excursions and Action Gestalts
Schutz & Luckmann (1973, : 52) state that it is “as Husserl has shown, a universal principle of consciousness that in my conscious acts I ‘live’ attentive to their intentional Objects, not to the acts themselves.” In the case of gesture, for example, this means that we generally do not attend to the hands or the movements of the hands as such, but we rather see “through them”, to some sort of content/referent (cf. Kendon, 2004, p. 358; Streeck, 2009b, p. 139). is quality of gestures may be called gestural transparency. However, not any movement that is part of gesture performances has this quality. Kendon (1978) made gesture researchers thoroughly aware of the fact that only some parts of the manual excursions that make up gestural movement are actually perceived as “the gesture”, standing out as an expressive ﬁgure against a ground and having the quality of gestural transparency, even though there is generally other movement going on both before and aer this part of the move-
79

C 3: A , ,  
ment excursion. Kendon has baptized such expressively articulated parts of bodily movements the stroke(s) (Kendon, 1980b), deﬁning it as the part of the manual excursion “in which the movement dynamics of ‘eﬀort’ and ‘shape’ are manifested with greatest clarity” (Kendon, 2004, p. 112). e movement phase coming before the stroke is called the preparation phase, and this is the movement of the articulating body part, typically the hand, that is required to arrive at the place where articulation begins. Aer the stroke, there may either be another preparation phase (in cases where several gestures are performed in sequence), or there may be a retraction phase⁸, which consists in the returning of the articulating part of the body to its rest position (Kendon, 1980b, p. 212). Although it is not strictly necessary, there is a strong tendency for gesture retractions to end where the initial preparation phase began, and this is the reason for the use of the term “excursions”.
e stroke together with the preparation is called a gesture phrase (note that the term “gesture phrase” is distinct from the term “gesture phase”, which refers to phases such as preparation, stroke, or retraction). If there is a retraction aer the gesture phrase, the excursion has reached its closure, and the gesture phrase plus the retraction then constitutes a full gesture unit. A simple example of a gesture unit with a preparation, a stroke, and a recovery phase is shown in Figure 3.1. ere can also be several gesture phrases in a row, without a retraction in between, so that there are several gesture phrases in the same gesture unit. Whenever a retraction is present, the gesture unit is ﬁnalized. e only obligatory part of this scheme is the stroke. All other phases are optional. e reason for this is that a gesture may be performed directly where the hand is located, without requiring a preparation phase or a retraction.
At various junctures during the movement excursion of a Gesture Unit there may also be holds, where the hand (which is the most common articulator of gestures) momentarily “pauses” in the course of a not yet ﬁnished movement excursion. 3.2 shows a more complete rendering of the gesture phase vocabulary that also includes holds. Post-stroke holds are holds that follow aer the stroke (Kita, 1993; Kita et al., 1998). ese are typically seen as a retention, or prolongation, of the gesture. Hence, the stroke together with any existing post-stroke hold constitutes the nucleus of the gesture phrase (Kendon, 2004). Pre-stroke holds are strokes that come before the stroke (Kita, 1993; Kita et al., 1998). Since the stroke has not yet started to be articulated when the pre-stroke hold occurs, if it occurs, the pre-stroke
⁸e term “retraction” seems to be used by most gesture researchers (e.g. McNeill, 2005), although Kendon uses the term recovery.

hold typically does not appear to be part of “the gesture” (the stroke) in the same way as post-stroke holds. Hence the pre-stroke holds appear outside the nucleus. Holding the movement for a brief moment oen serves to align the gesture with some particular part of a spoken utterance. However, there are also so-called stroke holds (McNeill, 2005, p. 32), which are a variant of strokes rather than a phase separate from strokes, the way pre-stroke and post-stroke holds are. Stroke holds refers to static strokes, where the hand is held still as part of the articulation of gesture. An example of this, provided by McNeill (ibid.), is when “raising a hand into the upper gesture space (preparation) and then holding it in place with the meaning of the upper ﬂoor of a building. ere is no motion, but there is content and ‘effort’ in terms of focused energy.” at is, in the case of stroke holds, there is “an information-laden component” (ibid., p. 283). Stroke holds are not shown in 3.2 since they are eﬀectively a stroke variant rather than a separate phase. On the other hand, the part of a movement excursion that appears to an observer as a stroke hold can simultaneously also take on the functions of a post-stroke hold, which means that stroke holds may eﬀectively serve as some sort of blend between strokes and post-stroke holds. In any case, they are part of the nucleus of the gesture phrase.
It is not always easy to identify the boundaries of these phases in a gestural movement excursion. is is partly due to the seamless character of some gestural move-

81

C 3: A , ,  
ment excursions, but also due to more intricate complexities such as the fact that the hand-shape to be used in a gesture may begin to be articulated before a certain movement that is also part of the stroke is actually carried out. For example, in a pointing gesture, the hand-shape may gradually build up during the preparation phase, before the gesture reaches its climax, so that it is hard to tell exactly when the stroke started. Nevertheless, as an analytic tool, the vocabulary of gesture phases is oen indispensable, since it allows for a much more precise analysis than what is possible when equipped only with the general term “gesture”. For example, this terminology helps disambiguating between “the onset of the gesture” in the sense of “the onset of the preparation” and “the onset of the stroke” (cf. Kendon, 2004), which may sometimes be crucial to avoid misunderstandings.
Since the analytic vocabulary of gesture phases has mainly been developed for purposes of describing empty-handed gestures one may ask how they apply to objectgestures, i.e., those expressive acts that involve handling of an object. Kendon (2004, p. 14) argues that it is precisely these kinds of “dynamic features” of gestural movements, captured in the analytic vocabulary of gesture phases just described, that make observers see some movements as intentionally expressive. He says that “deliberate expressiveness is manifest” and due to this we perceive “the quality of the action as intentional (not the speciﬁc intention, necessarily)”, without having to infer an intention explicitly. As I have suggested elsewhere (Andrén, in press a), the mere fact that many gestural excursions are performed with empty hands may itself be one such manifest feature of “deliberate expressiveness”. Perhaps even a particularly important one, as it may explain why the term “gesture” is oen treated as synonymous with what I call “empty-handed gesture”. Empty-handed excursionlike movements will, in themselves, have a very strong tendency to appear (a) volitional, due to their excursion-like character, and (b) performed for expressive rather than practical purposes, due to the absence of any handling of a physical object in the performance. is should not be interpreted as grounds for treating the absence of objects as a necessary feature in deﬁnitions of gesture, even though this is unfortunately precisely what many gesture researchers do (e.g. Acredolo & Goodwyn, 1990; Morford & Goldin-Meadow, 1992; Goldin-Meadow & Iverson, 1998; Nicoladis et al., 1999) (sometimes for theoretical reasons and sometimes for methodological reasons), with the exception of the particular acts of  and  which are commonly included in the category of “gesture” despite not being empty-handed. However, “deﬁning away” object-gestures obviously does not make them go away. Kendon’s (2004, p. 15) deﬁnition of gesture as those actions that have features of manifest deliberate expressiveness does not commit the mistake of excluding com-

municative acts that involve objects from the research agenda.⁹ However, in practice he does not analyze this class of actions himself, and therefore it remains unclear from his account of “gesture phases” how and if they might apply to communicative acts that do involve objects.
Although not the only one, Jürgen Streeck is one of the few gesture researchers who have taken an interest in object-gestures (e.g. Streeck, 1996). He points out that “in the context of conversation, it is usually not diﬃcult at all to identify gesture units and their boundaries. In contexts of work, however, gestural communication may consist in nothing more than a repetition or a slight embellishment or exaggeration of an instrumental act” (Streeck, 2009b, p. 23). is is true, but it should also be emphasized that not all object-gestures are necessarily a matter of such “slight embellishments”. In many cases object-gestures are as clearly articulated as empty-handed gesture.
Acts that involve objects (in general, not only object-gestures) also oen have the character of excursions and they oen have a phase-like structure in terms of preparation, stroke (“the actual act”), and retraction. Sacks & Schegloﬀ (2002) formulated the concept of “home position”, which is more or less equivalent to Kendon’s concept of “rest position”, around the same time as Kendon, in the 1970s (although in their case it was not published until much later). Sacks and Schegloﬀ say that they also noted the phenomenon of manual excursions — i.e., that when performing an action the hands oen end up aer the action where they began before the action, in a “home position” — when studying gestures, but they also add that the excursionlike character is frequent in many other kinds of actions as well (ibid., p. 141). In short, the overall logic of manual excursion and the vocabulary of gesture phases is applicable to many kinds of actions, not only empty-handed gestures, and not even communicative action only. Nevertheless, as the analysis in Chapter 9 will show, it is not always straightforward to do so, since it may depend on whether the practical aspects that may be present in a object-gestures are considered, or if one considers the expressive aspects of the object-gestures. For example, not all “stroke-like” handling of an object will appear foregrounded as expressive acts, entering into the
⁹For example, Kendon (1984, p. 81) points out that:
It is possible for actions to be performed in such a way that one cannot be quite certain whether they were shaped by a communicative intention or not. It is also possible for purely practical actions, such as sniﬃng a wine to test its bouquet or drawing upon a cigarette, to be informed to a greater or lesser degree with “ﬂourish” or “style.” To the extent that this is done, to this extent such actions may come to be seen as mainly gestural.
83

C 3: A , ,  
main attentional track of the joint activity (cf. Kendon, 1978; Goﬀman, 1974), and sometimes the reaching towards an object (i.e the “preparation” of the practical act) may serve as the “stroke” on an expressive level, if, for example, the reaching movement is frozen in the middle of the performance, which may serve as a pointing-like gesture (i.e., ).
One key feature that emerges from Kendon’s analysis of empty-handed gestures is that they have gestalt properties, even though he does not use this speciﬁc term. Some stretch of movement, the stroke, appear as some sort of unitary and foregrounded expressive “whole”, as an action gestalt.¹⁰ at is, even though the stroke may involve several movements and changing hand-shapes that unfold over time, and even though there may have been movement before (preparation) and aer (retraction) the movements that make up the stroke, strokes are somehow experienced as unitary wholes. For this reason, it could be argued that gesture (and action) is perceived at a certain “level”. is is not to say that gestures are interpreted at a static level (i.e., always interpreted at a ﬁxed level of abstraction or granularity), or that gestures and actions cannot be interpreted in several diﬀerent ways at different occasions. It is also worth keeping in mind that in actual situations, these acts are recognized as they unfold in time, rather than as units that are immediately given as wholes (the process/product distinction). e meaning of a communicative action is diﬀerent when it is ongoing compared to when there has been a retraction and the action has thus transformed into an aer-the-fact entity (Andrén, in press b,i). e point that I wish to make is just that in each particular case, at a particular moment, acts are experienced in some particular way, at a certain level of granularity. When someone picks up a phone and puts it to the ear, it is not generally perceived as a highly granular and subdivided sequence of “reaching”, “grabbing”, “liing”, but rather as a conveniently unitized and unitary act of “phoning”, or “bringing the phone to the ear”, or possibly some moderately subdivided sequence such as “picking up the phone, and putting it to the ear”. It could be perceived in a more zoomed in and ﬁne-grained fashion, but it is generally not, and even when it is (for example as part of gesture analysis), it just means that one attends to a diﬀerent aspect of the action, but now this aspect of the action becomes an action gestalt in its own right, so the same basic experiential “action gestalt” structure remains.
Gestures and multimodal utterances may be characterized in terms of weak and strong gestalts (Köhler, 1938 [1920]). Strong gestalts are holistic entities that could not, strictly speaking, be said to have “parts” at all. Strong gestalts may in fact be
¹⁰Hirsch (1993) has also discussed gesture in terms of gestalt structures, although from a slightly diﬀerent point of view than discussed in this section.
84

3.3. M   A G
hard to ﬁnd in the context of human action and experience, but there are for example electromagnetic phenomena that may be argued to qualify as strong gestalts (cf. Ash, 1995). More relevant to the study of gesture then are weak gestalts. Weak gestalts are rather the result of a weaker dialectic between parts and wholes, such that parts contribute to the interpretation of the act as a whole (bottom-up), but the overall act also contributes to the interpretation of the parts (top-down). In the case of weak gestalts, the parts are possible to perceive as unitary phenomena in themselves (oen even in multiple ways) when attention is shied, as described in the previous paragraph, even though they are also part of a whole on a higher level. e holistic or gestalt-like properties of gestures are thus generally towards the weak side of the spectrum in that we are not completely blind for the “parts”, i.e., the move(s) and hand-shape(s) and so forth that make up gestures as acts, even though we tend to see “through” them, to the overall acts as intentional wholes, and primarily to the stroke phase of these movements. Multimodal utterances, which consist in both bodily movement and speech are even more clear examples of weak gestalts, since the diﬀerent modalities (speech, bodily movement etc.) of the parts that make up the multimodal utterance almost per deﬁnition make them perceivable as somewhat separate entities.
It should however be noted that Köhler discussed “physical Gestalten”, and since we are dealing here with (inter)subjective and meaningful phenomena such as gesture we should also say that gestures are dependent gestalts, in that they depend on “subjective articulation” to receive their gestalt like properties. It should also be noted that this subjective aspect of action/gesture is not necessarily equivalent to perception of a gesture or an action. One could also follow Koa (1938 [1915], p. 377) and argue that actions (which is what he discusses rather than gestures in particular) are not only gestalt-like in their perceived appearances, but also in the constitution of their production:
We may in fact place the experiencing of Gestalten squarely beside that of creating Gestalten; to sing or play a melody, dash oﬀ a sketch, write, and so forth, are not cases where one sings or plays tones, or draws or writes strokes. e motor act is an organized whole-process; the many individual movements can be understood only as parts of the process which embraces them, and it is indeed only thus that they attain their particularity.
is brings us to the question of parts and wholes in gestural action and social activity, and that is the theme of the next section. ere I will be argued that gestures
85

C 3: A , ,  
are best understood both as (weak) wholes (action gestalts), constituted by underlying “operations” (its parts), but also that the gestures themselves serve as parts in an overarching activity, which also has the character of a (weak) whole.
3.4 Operation-act-activity interdependence
Leontiev (1981) made a threefold distinction between operations, actions, and activity for the purposes of describing the organization of activities. I suggest that it is also useful for the description of gestures and multimodal utterances. ese terms will be used here, although in somewhat unorthodox ways, not strictly compliant with Leontiev’s own use of them. rough some convenient bending of the meanings of these concepts, they can be made to ﬁt well with the idea of gestures and multimodal utterances as weak dependent gestalts. us, we may distinguish a level of actions, the level of action gestalts, which is the “level” in which we, as I intend to use these concepts, tend to perceive action both in the instrumental and the communicative sense (see Figure 3.3).
Further, there is the level “below” the actions, which Leontiev calls operations.¹¹ is will be referred to as the operational level. Operations in the case of gesture would be the actual movements that realize them, its parts, corresponding to the level of Kendon’s (2004) vocabulary of gesture phases (preparations, strokes, holds, etc). Whereas the action level is concerned with goals (or in the case of gesture, expression of meaning) operations are concerned with conditions. In the words of Leontiev (1981, p. 63), “If we imagine a case in which the goal remains the same and the conditions under which it is given change, then only the operational composition of the action changes.” In the case of single acts that consist in several operational steps, each individual step would generally be perceived as “insuﬃcient”, and perhaps even an incomprehensible or incomplete “movement”, on its own, unless re-interpreted in terms of an action gestalt (if possible).
ere is also the level “above” the level of actions, which is termed activity. Activities are, naturally, made up of a number of actions that form a whole on a higher level, sometimes with a more or less well-deﬁned (and jointly established) overall motive. ese acts need not involve gestures, but could be of any modality. It should be noted that the term “activity” refers both to the actual situated unfolding activity and to more situation-transcending kinds of “frames” (Goﬀman, 1974) relating to
¹¹Habermas (1991 [1981], p. 97) makes a similar distinction, when he states that “a bodily movement is an element of an action but not an action.“

well-known and recurrent kinds of activities. One could go on and introduce more distinctions other than the one between
the single act and the overarching activity, as well as the one between the operation level and the action level. For example, if such a commonplace event such as a spoken utterance is considered, which could be seen as “one action”, depending on how it is viewed, it is oen structured on multiple levels, such as phonemic organization, words, clauses, utterances, narratives, and so forth. ¹² However, the threefold distinction just presented is enough for the purposes of this thesis. e point is not so much that a particular activity or action may not be more complex than what this threefold distinction is able to capture, or that the levels are always easily identiﬁable, but rather that a given act or multimodal utterance is always situated in the tension between the parts that make it up (operations) and overarching wholes in which it itself is a part of (activities, and other forms of cultural contexts, genres, traditions, etc.)
As already mentioned, Leontiev’s distinction between operations, actions, and activities, is used in an unorthodox way here, and while Leontiev emphasized a principled functional dissociation between the levels¹³, I rather prefer to use these terms in a way that does not downplay the possibility of dependencies between the levels that may exist in particular cases. at is, just because actions can be carried out in diﬀerent ways, by means of diﬀerent operations, that does not mean that the signiﬁcance of an action is entirely independent of how it is performed, and the same thing goes for the actions that make up an activity.¹⁴
e relations between the levels of action and activity can be understood through the concept of act-activity interdependence (Linell, 1998, 2009; see also Duranti, 1991; Markova & Linell, 2007). An activity is partly constituted by its “constituent acts” (its parts), but the meaning of the “constituent acts” is also partly depending on their place in an overarching activity. For example, the utterance involved in pleading guilty in a court is part of what makes this activity a trial in the ﬁrst place,
¹²at which is at the operation level for an adult, such a phoneme, may be at the action level for an infant; see Zinchenko (1981) for a discussion of automatization in relation to Leontiev’s terminology.
¹³According to the way Leontiev views these distinctions, “the same” action can be carried out in several ways, by means of diﬀerent operations, and “the same” activity can be carried out in several ways, by means of diﬀerent actions (see Wertsch, 1981).
¹⁴As a somewhat extreme example, one may consider how ritual is a type of activity that generally does not permit permutations, or exchanges of constituent acts for other alternatives, in the performative sequence (Sørensen, 2010), even though there is always some elbow-room for slight variation even in such formal contexts (Andrén, Sanne & Linell, 2010).

and the act of pleading guilty becomes a true act of pleading guilty since it is part of a trial. Drawing on Leontiev’s distinction, I would argue that an analogous notion of operation-act interdependence could also be employed, or better yet, that the concept of act-activity interdependence could be extended into a more full-blown concept of operation-act-activity interdependence, placing action in the middle of this ﬁeld of interdependence.
It is clearly not desirable to treat any of these interdependence relations as unidirectional arrows, since doing so results in invalid forms of reductionism. For example, downward reductionism that traces the meaning of action only to the action itself and its underlying constituents fails to acknowledge how the meaning of an action, such as a gesture, is not only a result of the properties of the movement that make the gesture up, but also how it ﬁgures as part of an activity. One example of a line of theorizing that has committed this mistake is several of the mainstream pragmatic theories, such as those of Searle, Grice, and Sperber & Wilson, that tend to ignore the holistic aspects of (communicative) action, as they try to derive the meanings exclusively from constituent acts (Linell, 2009, p. 187). Upward reductionism that traces the meaning of action only to their place in an overarching whole, such as activities, or even “societies” or “class” and so forth, is equally misguided. As pointed out earlier, the term “activity” is ambiguous in that it refers both to (A) the situated sense-making of a particular situation as well as to (B) more situationtranscending and recurrent kinds of activities that may serve as a framing of individual actions. With respect to A, upwards reductionism amounts to interactional reductionism (cf. Levinson’s 2005, p. 451 critique of Schegloﬀ, 1987), where any action on behalf of an individual is solely treated in terms of its interactional nature. With respect to B, upwards reductionism amounts to rigid forms of structuralism, where the acts of an individual is only considered in terms of its third-person intentionality qualities (what Garﬁnkel, 1967 termed a “cultural dope” or “judgemental dope”), such as “acting as a middle-class man”, which eﬀectively denies the actor of
